I can't actually upload the entire file here since it's too large, it's on my google drive.
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1asThn272dqv_EfG5vkQXWzJ-anR8QKND?usp=sharing

It consists of 2 files:
1. config.json
2. model.safetensors

To use this model:
Please download the files and save them in a **folder** with the appropriate name
Edit the **model_save_path** variable in 'BERT (distilbert) finetuning.ipynb' with the folder's filepath
