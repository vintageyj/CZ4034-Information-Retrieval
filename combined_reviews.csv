NCR,4.0,"Feb 8, 2024",Good teams trying to save aging tech,SMB Account Manager,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,"NCR is a great place to get corporate experience. Working in SMB Hospitality, the teams really cared about restaurants and did their best. Managers were open to feedback and very supportive. Restaurant technology is a fun industry.","The biggest challenge for the NCR SMB Hospitality is aging technology. NCR Aloha was the clear market leader a decade ago but the resources were not invested to keep it current. This is resulting in much of the SMB market going to Toast.

Also, the support and billing were moved overseas. These people are nice but often aren't properly trained. This leads to very angry customers over long support holds and duplicate billing. They are trying to make NCR Silver (Aloha Cloud) the future but it needs much more investment to catch up with competitors (like Toast & Square).

All that being said, I enjoyed my time at NCR because of the people. There is still a place for NCR in larger chains. If you only have restaurant experience and want to get a corporate business job, this is a great place to start."
NCR,1.0,"Mar 7, 2024",Terrible,Customer Service Technician,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Manchester, NH","Training is pretty decent for entry level. If you have to work here, volunteer for as much training as you can, and then leave. 

That's about it.","The hours in my area were variable. Sometimes you started at 730am, and this would ruin until 530pm. Yes, the standard day is 10 hours, but you only get paid for 8. First and last 30 minutes of travel are unpaid, and there's a mandatory 1 hour (unpaid) lunch that you have to take. They're obviously hoping you just work through it, which happens to most techs I've met. Pretty scummy behavior, but it gets worse.

When I submitted my 2 weeks notice, I asked my boss if NCR paid out unused PTO he said that they did. He said that so I wouldn't ask for some of the time of my 2 weeks notice off, because I'm my state they do NOT do that.

On my last day, I submitted my last expense report on my company card. I thought everything was settled. They never contacted me at all after that. They never paid the last set of expenses despite my documentation, and just let my AMEX go to collections. Their turnover is also crazy. My brother had 4 managers in 2.5 years, because again, terrible place."
NCR,2.0,"Feb 5, 2024","Sales-Focused, not Execution Focused",Account Support Manager,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","Raleigh, NC",Many great coworkers and friends I’ve made over the years. First line management is also generally pretty good and grounded.,"This company is run by people who are career salesmen. And sales is all that they care about. This is reflected in almost all levels of the culture. Sales teams are often (and exclusively even) given the best perks and benefits, and are almost always the only ones being recognized by executive leadership on the all-hands calls. 

Meanwhile NCR invests laughably little (about 3%) into innovating the vast array of legacy products it constantly misrepresents as being cutting edge, and the actual newer products are also often years ahead of being working and viable solutions, but are sold anyways.

Execution and delivering on promises to customers is a distant second priority. That is until this rush to the sale’s finish line mantra complicates another sales opportunity, and leadership will then throw all hands on deck to (temporarily) fix said problem to keep the customer on the sales hook.

You will constantly hear executive leadership saying “the customers are first”. It’s all nonsense. What they really mean is “the sales pipeline is first”. And these aren’t just my words, at least three high level customer contacts (c-suite and director) have told me this same thing over the years."

They are some truly awesome people in Omaha that you trauma bond with.,"The leadership within Omaha leaves much to be desired. It’s very top down and many people have left the company because of one leader in particular, yet nothing will change because the leadership group goes way back prior to D3. They have very unrealistic expectations of Product Owners, and don’t clearly communicate those expectations until it’s a problem. I left because the work life balance was not good, the leadership said you should be a full SME within 3-6 months, but would change the span of ownership every over month. It was very hectic and if they felt you weren’t keeping up or asked too many questions, you were labeled as incompetent by one leader and she made sure you were aware of it. 
This leader also disregarded any type of Covid restriction the company put in place because she was vocally anti-vax."
NCR,5.0,"Feb 19, 2024",Good Experience,Systems Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Atlanta, GA",Lots of experience around. Many people have worked at the company for decades.

A specific person on the management team made sexually abusive remarks and was not fired or reprimanded at all. Management was covering up for this person and nothing ever happened. I felt as I was forced to quit I couldn't even listen to the sound of his voice when we called meetings. What kind of business are they running?

We all did our best despite the workload becoming more and more as people get let go and no backfill. 

There is quite the building of comradery as we suffer together.","This company sets you up for failure. It is sink or swim here, and it is most common for people to be drowning. Terrible communication, zero training, and no documentation.

I stupidly worked extremely long hours because it was urgent. Nothing is ever urgent when everything is urgent.

I had very inadequate managers, project managers, and coworkers. Most of my team was abroad. They were absolutely incompetent and liars. There were a few star developers sprinkled in. Many had no idea what they were doing and constantly pushed out bad code. They didn't like when I pointed out their problems. It meant they had eyes on them. I've experienced them lying about them doing work. They couldn't possibly do work if their lab wasn't up and connected.

I feel bad for the good ones who worked long hours and weekends."
NCR,4.0,"Oct 30, 2023",NCR,Executive Director,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Atlanta, GA","Working at NCR Corporation in the Professional Services department provides a unique blend of positive experiences and challenges. The company offers a dynamic work environment, encouraging personal and professional growth, and fostering a culture of collaboration. Employees often find themselves surrounded by talented colleagues, enabling knowledge sharing and skill development. NCR's Professional Services division is an exciting place for those who enjoy a fast-paced and ever-evolving industry. The projects are engaging and the opportunities to work with a diverse clientele are enriching.","However, some may find that the company's organizational structure can be somewhat disorganized. The fast-paced nature of the work often requires adaptability and a certain level of self-direction. Yet, it can sometimes pose challenges for those who thrive in more structured environments. This aspect might not suit everyone, but for those who appreciate flexibility and can navigate amidst ambiguity, NCR Corporation remains an excellent place to learn and grow in the realm of professional services."
NCR,3.0,"Feb 29, 2024",Company Review,Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,Work life balance is good,Salary does not match market
NCR,1.0,"Jan 8, 2024",Great Pay but miserable life.  ,Sales Representative,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,Work from home. Base pay and commissions are good. Benefits are solid.,You'll be getting texts and calls from their unhappy customers after 5 p.m. and on weekends. Worst company I've ever worked for in regards to management. In just 3 years I've gone through 3 VP's of Sales and 3 Sales Managers. Over 200% turnover on my team of 20 people and to date nobody is still employed that I worked with. I was literally the Last of the Mohicans. NCR does not have their stuff together and the recently just outsourced (1.5 years ago) all of their internal processes and sales support to other countries like Siberia. It takes over a week to get quotes approved and management has no idea what their doing. Stay away from NCR unless you really like having extra doses of stress.

They train you fully and give you all the tools/equipment you will need. Very good union contract which guarantees you generous sick days, vacation time, overtime, and many other quality-of-life perks.","The base pay, while certainly not bad, isnt great either. With overtime you will make a lot but when overtime is slow you wont make as much. Also, if you are in a non-unionized area you will have very little say over how many hours you work each day and will have no contract protections. Also, if not in the union areas there is ""pay for performance"" which basically means you get a 1% raise every few years because the metrics they use to measure your performance are totally rigged.

Starting pay is strong, and healthcare package (as of 2022) is incredibly good, especially for family.

Focus is on competency, in North Carolina. Having a fancier degree doesn't get you any more attention/special treatment, and talented folks with less formal credentials get their shot to be experts. Strong social diversity in hiring.","Nutanix privately sold a bunch of equity to Bain in late 2020, after which things started going downhill:
* Within 18 months, SREs were expected to have twice the output, with no compensation changes.

* CEO left the company around this time, ""totally unrelated."" Company doubled down on its aims and rhetoric around becoming profitable. Obviously the company needs to be profitable to survive, but in my opinion they are doing so at the cost of intangibles - customer loyalty, product quality, employee wellness.

* Company culture is being gutted if it is not reportable/justifiable. Employees are given less agency and less time to be creative. Middle managers gaslight any employees who point out recent changes.

--- GENERAL ---

* Salaries are suppressed. I made more money as a recently-hired SRE 2 than several SRE 3s I spoke with, who had stayed at the company 5+ years. 

* For Support specifically: Middle managers are disorganized and uncoordinated. Support leadership has no agency to secure the needs of the SREs. Healthcare package will likely be watered down within 5 years."

Everyone is so focused on getting the work done that we don’t spend a lot of time on employee recognition and development. Career growth and development are pushed by HR but their not structured or adopted enough to be mainstream.  

-Challenge. The fast pace and demand is not for the light hearted. If you thrive in that type of environment you’ll be happy here.

Early on, the product worked well, was simple and was differentiated among a competitive market.","Post-IPO is when things started to change. There was lots of ""leadership"" brought in from other big-name competitors which changed the culture drastically and that started a mass-exodus of existing leadership and employees that were there for a long time. The product become overly complex and riddled with bugs. Once the pricing structure changed, the products became too expensive for what they were, even with drastic discounting. If you were fortunate enough to sell and make your quota, renewals were ridiculously expensive and renewal rates plummeted. Territories were split (even smaller markets) and new teams were brought in to ""increase revenue"", which did nothing more than invoke backstabbing in the field across GEO's and verticals. Execs will talk at length about the Annual Contract Value (ACV) growth, but when you really look at overall revenue over the last several years, it's quite stagnate."

Most of the big projects I've been on so far have been fun to work on. There are also a lot of talented, kind, and helpful engineers at Stripe who are really nice to learn from. I really enjoy my manager and the folks on my team. The money + bonuses are ~ok~. Pretty standard for a pre-IPO unicorn, but the goal is that there will be a big pay off later (fingers crossed).","- The work life balance is *bad*. For how many products Stripe has, we are a very lean company. Too lean. There's just a lot of work, and very very tight deadlines, very fast paced, and not enough engineers and product managers to do all of it. If you want WLB as an engineer, join an infrastructure team, not a product team. 

- There is little to no investment in making the engineering org more diverse. This was surprising to me because of a lot of public facing company statements, but don't be fooled like I was. People (at least in the eng org) do not care about diversity. 

- HR sucks. And of course they would, I guess. But I had a really negative experience with HR where I walked away feeling completely devalued and gaslit.

Their view is it's a race and they want to win.

The main challenge I saw while working there was the company strategy & bets constantly changed (except core payments). It's important to pivot and be flexible, but the frequency with which Stripe did this means a lot of wasted effort planning and re-planning.

They like to talk a big game about work/life balance, but peers don't support each other and it's toxically competitive; even people with nothing to gain from undermining you might stab you in the back, which means you spend a lot of time watching your back instead of doing your work. 
Bad management on various levels, the worst being: management struggles to provide clarity around orgs' true goals and tends to fall back on threatening vs coaching other managers. Middle managers are overburdened and don't have time to focus on the people management aspects of their roles.

Why? I'm not sure why. Maybe because they think they've already ""made it"" to the big bucks and they can rule and be rude with the low-profile engineers in the company? I've never expected this kind of treatment of people in Stripe. Never. While in public Patrick and John Collison run a narrative of being the good guys, behind the doors, well, they are clearly NOT.

I was part of a layoff that was announced in November 2022, and even the severance offered was generous and really helpful.","There was this slight feeling of lack of transparency from higher levels of leadership. This meant that sometimes it was hard to know whether or not the work I was doing was worth doing or being done correctly. The most frustrating was being part of a larger project but needing to figure out how to navigate or set up the base of that project because of some of the gatekeeping happening. During the layoff process, though the severance was generous, the communication around some of the details was challenging to get answers to and sometimes took way too long. The other frustrating thing was to see new job openings appear during my final weeks, but I had some surprising difficulty with the timing of interviews to my last day."

* Benefits are great, even with pay and stock options not being what they used to be. Especially good for parents or expectant parents.
* Great food in their really swanky office(s)
* Flexibility for working from home regularly
* Lots of self-taught learning opportunities, you'll definitely take on new skill sets","* No recourse for outright toxic management, to say nothing about mediocre or bad management
* No feedback culture, very low scores on employee surveys each year. Umbrella reminders for employees to give each other feedback regularly but no enforcement for management to provide feedback to their reports.
* Job expectations are extremely vague and seem to be left that way on purpose
* Appear to be doing broad layoffs in preparation for IPO and likely to be able to hire in lower-pay employees, so make sure compensation seems worth it if you are given an offer
* Removed unlimited vacation
* Expectation that you self-teach skills not listed in your hiring responsibilities in order to ""level up,"" minimal to no training offerings in those areas. Exceptions for technical/programming skills - skills like project management etc. are expected to be self-taught with absolutely zero guidance.
* Basically no upward mobility, though parallel mobility is accessible to some.
* Work/Life balance is only achievable if you are okay with mediocre performance reviews and the consequences thereof. Unspoken requirement to run yourself ragged if you want to get good performance reviews, though also apparently no actual way/route to ever meet standards for highest ""levels"" of performance. Top performers seem to burn out and need to take medical leave after a couple of years, for which they're often penalized, yet never meet highest performance levels according to performance reviews."

Stripe,2.0,"Sep 27, 2023",Hiring and leadership need significant changes,GTM,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"Great level of autonomy, really great community of employees, pretty good benefits. People are generally very reasonable, nice, and empathetic, everyone seems to realize we're all in the same boat. I had 3 different mgrs in 2 years, but my last one was great and did what he could for me with the resources he had. I loved my teammates.","Going to just give a smattering in no particular order: - There's a culture of quasi-toxic positivity: What I mean is that ""everyone's idea is important and no one shouldn't follow through with their ideas"" tends to be the prevailing sentiment. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of good ideas out there and because Stripe tends to hire very bright people its even more the case, but that doesn't mean there's time, resources, or the ability to prioritize, those ideas. It translates into a bunch of people doing what they think is important, or multiple people doing the same thing they both think is important. - Thinking big to a fault: instead of addressing and resolving the baseline systems, processes, policies, etc. the business overall seems keep going after huge ""sexy"" and shiny things. As a result the business blunders along and everyone's basically building a house of cards because we've yet to address the aforementioned fundamentals. - Hiring: I personally found (and I say this having probably benefited from it) that they hire people largely based on where they went to school (you see a lot of harvard, yale, columbia, cornell, etc.) or if they worked at a FAANG. Sure these schools and companies have great people but that doesn't inherently translate into a good fit for the role or company. In addition I found they tend to favor external hires over internal, prioritizing the same thing I just mentioned. The hiring process is also wildly protracted; they make people jump through so many hoops and in the end are not very rigorous on decision making e.g. I was on one interview loop where despite interviewing 2 candidates I was never involved in the discussion on whether to hire or not. The issues with hiring are a real problem as they'll quickly balloon into bigger issues e.g. your top existing talent getting becoming resentful, apathetic of jaded, or a bunch of smart people that think they're above or aren't willing to do the grunt work. Last point is semi related where I found that they hired WAY overqualified people for pretty unsophisticated roles, e.g. a role that would've been a good fit for a 3-4 years experience biz analyst type background they hire someone with 10+ years of experience in sr. analyst experience. Those hires end up either feeling like they were sold a false bill of goods or just get bored and leave - saw it many times. - Ownership: tends to be a lack of ownership, which I myself was guilty of. There's no strong sense of ownership so you'll go to teams for help on something and everyone will point to someone else or say its not their responsibility. I was guilty of doing the same thing, primarily because I was able to and everyone else was, so why not. This lead to it being really hard to get anything productive done and eventually to me just giving up trying. - Compensation: Personally I found the compensation to be subpar (I won't lie, I was willing to accept it in the hopes, like I suspect many others were, of equity growth). This was evidenced in the fact that I took a pay cut to join, and got a huge (>30%) pay increase when I left. Equity comp was lack luster at best, as was getting worse when I left. Salary and bonus okay. The compensation change communications were opaque, if communicated at all. Separately it took me 5 months of back/forth with the compensation team to have them correct an error (they admitted it was an error in the end) in my compensation. - Leadership: I found a general vibe of a lot of mid to sr. leaders having this vibe or air of superiority and entitlement. I felt like many had this idea of when they came into the job they'd get big ol' teams that they could boss around and then just be a talking head rather than actually getting their hands dirty. That just translated into a lot of the stuff I mentioned above happening, e.g. people just doing whatever they wanted and nothing critical getting done unless sh*t was hitting the fan. Beyond this I think exec and C level leadership are also part of the problem. Its easy to pin things on the people at the middle or the bottom, but ultimately the buck stops with the top. If its happening down below its because the top enables and allows it. - No career opportunity: may have been because I wasn't based in the US but I found zero opportunity for career growth. I did get promoted (though I think I accepted a lower starting level than I should've), but aside from that I had a mgr hired above me, and found no other opportunities."

Stripe,2.0,"Apr 3, 2023",Just work harder,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,- Good compensation - Generous equity package - Benefits - Friendly and supportive colleagues,"- The company's lack of focus and direction means new priorities are constantly added. Few are ever removed. Teams are expected to work harder to deliver on all of them. - The inability to prioritize is prevalent at all levels. Example: employee performance is evaluated against 16 operating principles (plus 7 oldies but goldies that Stripe just couldn't let go of). So, as an employee you have 23 different principles and slogans you need to consider for how to do the myriad of tasks that are thrust upon you. 
- Staff turnover was high even before the layoffs in Nov 2022. Whoever is left is expected to pick up the slack when people leave. Open positions are rarely backfilled these days. You just have to work harder. Burnouts are common. 
- If you're in one of the smaller offices or remote, don't expect Stripe to follow local labor laws when it comes to working hours, overtime, vacation etc. If you bring this up with HR, you are likely to be dismissed with a blanket statement about global policy."

- Very little support offered to closers. AEs are expected to do a lot of their own prospecting. The outbound org is still very undeveloped. 
- Same goes for post-signed support. No clean breaks. Even if you attach a support package to your deal, you'll find yourself continuing to work with that company well after you close the deal.
- You spend less time selling and more time working in tickets given the complexity of deals at Stripe.
- Really bad sales incentives compared to other high growth sales organizations.

* Good benefits - decent budget for home office, flexible hybrid approach.
* Peers are generally very responsive, supportive, knowledgable in the field and are idea-driven;
* Many 'in-development' processes which can be a good ramp for visibility if you are proactive.","* High tempo and potential micromanagement (rigorous work time monitoring, breaks/lunch logging, explaining missed minutes, etc.);
* Some KPIs are inflated beyond any logic, the company treats AML sector strictly in 'quantity over quality' manner which directly translates how the specialists are treated too. Quality assurance is practically non-existent;
* Terrible horizontal and vertical career paths and roadmapping, or lack thereof. Supervisors are clueless about any growth prospects and tend to shake off responsibility of assisting their staff in developing in any direction. Internal interview processes are very chaotic, managers won't always be familiar with actual job ad details, can be late to their own interviews (or do not show up at all). Also, internal hiring managers tend to play politics behind applicants' backs, discriminate based on specific team/jurisdiction, and avoid feedback or contact post-interview; 
* Zero knowledge and expertise development support. Managers will not provide you with any certificate or courses prospects, neither will HR - actually, they might suggest you to ""ask your colleagues to forfeit the team-building budget for your certificate"";
* Some AML functions demand staff to work during inconvenient shifts, late hours, weekends;
* The company seriously struggles with its employee rating and performance review system which gets re-done every quarter when CZ gets obsessed over a new radical system."
Binance,1.0,"Jul 27, 2023","Unreasonable expectations, lack of transparency, frequent firing",Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",,Binance is a well-known crypto company,"Terrible hours, expect to work 24/7 - Most of the leadership is based in the Middle East or APAC. If you live outside of those time zones, you will be regularly expected to attend calls before 7am and after 10pm North America time. Highly centralized and political - All decisions roll up to the leadership team. Even small decisions need to be looked at by CZ. Decisions take forever and the leadership team is always the gatekeeper of approvals, yet they expect you to reach absurdly high KPIs. Unreasonable expectations - They expect you to regularly work until 3am and attend meetings at ~6am, and set KPIs that are 2-5 times more than what a normal company would set. They motivate employees through fear of getting fired since no one can hit these KPIs. Chinese-centric - If you do not speak business Chinese, you will not make it far in this company. Most of the leadership is Chinese native, and not English native. If you cannot present your ideas in Chinese, it may fall on deaf ears. There is a ""PMO"" or bilingual secretary (usually a senior IC-level junior person) assigned to each member of leadership. These PMOs are constantly trying to gatekeep and elevate themselves, even if it means throwing team members under the bus. Lack of integrity - during the mass 2023 US employee layoff, there were cases of actively reducing severance packages initially promised."

Good opportunity to experience collaborating with people from countries all over the map. You may be lucky to work with great team members. I've heard stories of many people like this, however, being such a broad, mostly remote company, every member tells a different story of their experience in Binance. In my time here, I'd say I have heard a 70/30 ratio in negative/positive stories including the present year. Last year It would have been a more even number.","If the idea of the display of true character in the face of adversity is true, I do not think Binance did a good job when adversity has hit it, and it shows in its growing negative feedback as it does in the current inner atmosphere. Ruling by fear, causing a point-the-finger and cover-my-ass-first culture over addressing problems with problem solving drive as its priority, which is hard to avoid when no one wants to look stupid in group communications. Very low display of accountability at the organizational level. They strongly encourage feedback, yet all I see when angry people submit feedback to Binance, is that their response is basically to 'apologize' for your personal feelings (which anyone with any sense understands it's a diplomatic copout) then proceed to send you a link to an article where they explain why Binance is basically not wrong, it's just complicated and you were not a cultural fit.

A backstabbing and blame culture that I’ve never seen anything close to before. I’ve witnessed someone fabricate a situation in order get one of their team members fired - and it worked (my concerns over this were then laughed off and ignored by HR). Completely opaque organisation - for a company claiming to be focused on the ‘freedom of money’ they sure do have a lot to hide, even from their own employees. Mainland China style work culture (though saying that is probably unfair to other Chinese companies) 9-9-6 would be an improvement for the work life balance of many at Binance.

You will be punished for being efficient at your job and the so-called freedom is only a perception as finishing your work efficiently makes management think you are skiving. When e-learning is not completed. HR threatens to withhold your pay. Having a high compensation from the company is the very reason you may lose your job when management suddenly decides to cut costs. HR and management also intend to find several excuses to try and fire individuals without severance and insidiously get your managers to schedule one-on-one calls but will unpleasantly bait-and-switch you with HR in a call to let you know you have been made redundant. Despite what the CEO says about letting people go on twitter, the truth is far from it. The company likes to operate in ambiguity and has questionable practices.

I wouldn't change my time at NetApp, the relationships I made last to this day.","NetApp is lost, like a lot of legacy hardware storage providers trying to navigate a cloud connected world. Their value prop is murky and they are a commodity in a saturated market. 
Why am I writing a post 3 yrs removed from the company.....this company lost their integrity and this line NetApp opens with when they post a job, is not genuine and is insulting, ""We’re forward-thinking technology people with heart.""
Does a company with heart, eliminate your position while you are undergoing cancer treatment? Apparently in NetApp's eye's their definition of heart does include such behavior....disgusting! The definition of Heart for NetApp means kick people aside when they are there most vulnerable.
I understand a catchy marketing slogan, but can a marketing team be that out of touch with the culture and reality of their own company? Apparently yes.
If you are considering a job at NetApp, spend some time doing research, look up Tom Mendoza speaking on culture, David Hitz on what NetApp was when he felt his kid was old enough to embark on new challenges. Reach out to past NetApp employees on LinkedIn to understand the company you don’t see in their hiring ads. 
Ask insightful questions based on your research and most importantly understand why after so many rounds of layoffs that have impacted 1000’s, that this company is worth trusting your livelihood and the wellbeing of you and your family? 
The people I know and love still at NetApp are looking over their shoulders waiting for the next axe to drop. All biding their time for the job market to pick up, so they can run away from this NetApp’s “Heart”."

Could be really jarring at times especially after getting comfortable with something new. Layoffs happened 3 times while I was there, I was effected as well (severance is solid though fwiw). Company is surviving off legacy products and rolling the dice every 2 years or so on 10+ different product lines to see if something lands (usually with no success).

Based on your luck, you might actually work with a certain good folk.","I worked at NetApp for a few years and it was one of the worst work experiences I have ever had. The company's frequent layoffs and workforce reductions made it a place of constant instability and fear, where employees were more concerned about their own job security than working together to achieve shared goals. In such a toxic work environment, employees tended to backstab each other, spreading rumors and sabotaging each other's work to gain an edge in the constant competition for job security. This further eroded morale and made it almost impossible to build a sense of team spirit. The frequent layoffs also led to a lack of continuity and stability, with projects being started and then abruptly abandoned, or teams being restructured and reshuffled every few months. This made it difficult to get any meaningful work done, and employees were constantly worried about whether their jobs would still be there the next day. Overall, NetApp is a company that seems to prioritize short-term profits over the well-being and development of its employees. The constant layoffs and workforce reductions create a culture of fear and mistrust, where employees are more likely to backstab each other than collaborate to achieve shared goals. I would strongly caution anyone considering employment at NetApp to think twice and carefully evaluate the company's track record with layoffs before making a decision"

Joined with the expectation that I was to report to a specific manager, offer letter even stated that fact, then was forced to report to someone with substantially less management experience. I ended up regretting not standing up for myself.

Tobi and his exec team operate as a god-like boys club - they do what they want at the expense of the emotional and psychological safety of their employees, e.g., Chaos Monkey at the start of 2023.

It was challenging at best to get support for Merchant problems - get technical teams to jump on calls and discuss solutions with Merchants.

Very little authentic communication between leadership and their teams - in the dark about why changes happen and when they might be coming down the pike - and teams and individuals suffer for it. The company overhired in big ways and compensated with multiple mass layoffs and firing people just before they vested. Multiple people were fired or left after taking medical leave just on my individual team (never a good sign for team health). Expectations for roles were unclear and individuals were easily thrown under the bus by toxic upper management to look good for their bosses. The overall environment was chaotic and lacked stability.

Case-and-point, he acquires a fulfillment company for 2.1 billion dollars, only to sell it for 1.1 billion dollars 10 months later. This is not an example of sane or prudent decision making. I understand that successful acquisitions are rare but I've never seen an acquisition given up on or resold less than a year later. Such whimsical decision making does not happen with people who know how to run companies. - Senior leadership outright lies. Case-and-point, in Feb 2023, the president of Shopify states that no more layoffs will happen. Then 3 months later a 20% layoff occurs. Even the most senior leaders of a company cannot guarantee, under all circumstances, that layoffs will not occur. So don't bother saying that they won't occur in major business news publications. This is an example of why you shouldn't take what leadership says at face value. - Depending on where you are in the organization, you may find yourself on project where you have to deliver features, quality be damned. You may or may not be okay with this approach to software development. - Internal processes and communication tools change with no realized benefit. On the contrary, there have been net negative benefits of some changes. - Attempts at fostering a trusting culture are laughable."

Working at Shopify is a fast-paced and intense learning experience. You'll likely be exposed to innovative projects, teams, and roadmaps you can't find elsewhere.","Becoming a 100-year company is a goal that comes with some friction. With two mass layoffs in a year, consistent restructuring, and reductions in spending, the efforts to increase revenue can be felt throughout the organization. You'll notice an emphasis on thriving on change, which is similar to most companies in the tech/SaaS space. In most cases, rapid change led to thrown-out roadmaps, teams unable to normalize, skipped review cycles, or smaller projects that never made it to launch. Once the post-pandemic growth dust settles, I think that thriving on change will turn back into a ""pro"". For now, it comes across as if there's a lack of top-level focus (too many drastic pivots). Advise: 1) Never stop learning; this level of knowledge is rare at a company! 2) Pay attention to company changes, specifically any benefit changes. 3) Watch for any major leadership shifts or exits."

During my time, the company went through several restructurings that created a sense of instability and uncertainty. I had a total of 5 managers during my time there, with each less and less relevant to my craft. Despite meeting the expectations of my role, I was recently let go without a clear explanation. I've noticed that Shopify has been quietly laying off employees since the last major wave in July. There seems to be a focus on people of color this time around. As someone who belongs to several protected classes, I cannot help but feel that I may have been singled out, given that other non-minority colleagues in the same role were able to remain at the company. Adding to this, a Shopify brand leader recently posted a very controversial offsite team photo on LinkedIn showing a clear lack of diversity. Over 30 people are visible in the photo, but not a single person of color can be seen. The photo was shared on Blind, and several users shared my concerns. In their comments, Shopify employees said that ""the closer you are to being a white man, the more likely you are to succeed at Shopify"" and ""Shopify is the least diverse company I have ever worked for."" These statements ring true to the core. Overall, potential employees should be aware of these issues before considering a position at the company. The lack of transparency, commitment to diversity, and apparent willingness to let talented employees go without clear justification make it a difficult and potentially risky place to work."

Way too much hands on intervention by the CEO. It was a running joke that you couldn't get through a product review he was involved in without some product or technical change he'd insist on despite not having anywhere near enough product or technical context for it to matter. But everyone always did it because it was understood you don't say no. Made everyone sit through 4 days of meetings after the layoffs in 2022 where the executive team congratulated themselves on how good of a job they did firing 1000 people.

Shopify is unpredictable, but the one thing you can always expect is to be let down when the opportunity presents itself. Management took a 180 on their values, they work their people to the bone, and they consistently promise good things and then take them away. Projects change hourly, not daily or weekly, but hourly. If you care about having a life that is meaningful, do not work at Shopify - you won't have time or sanity left for the rest of your life. The bar for hiring no ""jerks"" has dropped, and the managers who cared about your well-being have all fled the company. Oh, and they pride themselves on not compensating people as they should for market value in tech. Everyone talks about quitting all the time, even senior management. It was a disappointing experience, to say the least, and I wouldn't wish my worst enemy to work there."

They seem to be trying to hold on to their start-up roots, but the chaos with projects, ever-changing priorities, and unrealistic expectations makes for a very toxic work environment. Managers are very immature, both in their experience and in their approach to dealing with people. I have never been so disrespected and have not seen others so disrespected by managers and leadership like this before. I had high hopes when I got the job, but I was very quickly disappointed. That disappointment lasted the entire time."

For a company that is known to underpay, I was always amazed by the level of skill we were able to onboard.","Over the last year the culture at Shopify took a steep dive. New SLT seems to forget that they are running a team of humans. A lot of unreasonable pressure and expectations are being pushed downstream while SLT is never held accountable for their choices.

The company made promises to their employees regarding compensation adjustments and proceeded to miss all of their timelines one by one without any accountability.

We're now policing public messages to make sure no one is voicing anything with any resemblance of criticism to our leadership team. While I was not at Shopify very long, I did get the impression that disagreeing with SLT or criticizing our CEO was truly something you were not allowed to do there. Ironically, it feels like the easiest way to prevent that would have been to not give people a reason to feel so passionately against the job SLT is doing."

Pretty good work-from-home culture (better when I started than when I left). The people are incredible - brilliant, dedicated, and committed to doing good work. Decent technology and you have the tools you need to do your job, for the most part. Pretty good benefits.","The number one issue that Shopify has and will continue to have is the quality, or lack of quality, in their senior leadership. The people running the company probably think of all the chaos and disruption they cause as benefits, but that's just not true. You simply cannot run a company of close to 10K employees the same way you run a small startup, no matter how much you might WANT that to be the case. Leadership talk about the Chaos Monkey all the time, but they a) misunderstand the value proposition of the original, and b) use it as an excuse to do things that are poorly planned and badly executed. Pointing out the self-inflicted wounds tends to get the argument that its just part of Shopify's culture, which seems like a bad culture. Chaos Monkey at Netflix taught engineers to build redundant, resilient systems. Chaos Monkey at Shopify teaches employees that everything they count on can be undone at the whim of an executive and with no warning. Everyone using Slack? Nope, we're all going to Facebook for Business (aka Workplace for Meta), and we wiped all the history in the public channels because ""chaos"". Not enough people using Work Facebook? We're shortening the retention period in Slack so it'll be less useful. (I'm sure the fact that the COO is from Facebook has nothing to do with the decision to move to Work Facebook.) The employees are amazing, but the senior leaders are driving the company into the ground. The only executives with serious leadership experience at large, established tech companies left during my tenure there, and it really shows."

Thank you for showing me that hard work and dedication are not enough to succeed in this company, and that brown-nosing and backstabbing are the real keys to advancement. Thank you for teaching me that taking credit for others' work is a sign of strength, and that blaming others for your own mistakes is a great way to show leadership. I will miss the constant stress, the never-ending drama, and the feeling of constantly walking on eggshells.

Zero transparency, no way of providing feedback, and they make big decisions without any discernible rationale. The way they treat their employees is just incredibly disrespectful. For example, there was a silent promo freeze that lasted 9 months. I understand why given the economy, but it was *never* acknowledged. So many people just spent months waiting and waiting, their career development stalled, without leadership ever saying one word about it. As others have mentioned, it's extremely common for Tobi to overturn many months of careful strategy on a project, based on his own whim. Managers are also insulted by the company very publicly.

There's a huge problem when a company of this size doesn't know what it wants to be for any customer that isn't SMB and can't communicate its value clearly beyond a few key talking points. That might have worked when the tide was heading perfectly in its direction, but that's not the case now. Bigger issue is for any quota carrying rep at Shopify. The managers who are directing strategy and ultimately responsible are not trying to figure out core issues, such as: TAM, territories and data integrity. This leaves reps not knowing where to hunt, what to hunt for and praying that when shakeups occur they have something to work with. The market is generally much smaller at the enterprise than management wants to believe, until there is real product market fit. That will likely take 2-5 years to sort out."

The end result is hundreds of individual contributors being blocked for weeks at a time while waiting for their next few minutes with Tobi, and middle leadership layers being relatively powerless to provide real direction or agency.

Favouritizm is at its extreme in a PPT driven leadership culture, all the while, the people who keep the company going are never listened to.

(I wasn't the only one let go on the same day.) -You're given way more job responsibilities without a choice that are out of the job description you applied for and there is no compensation given. -If you think for a second that you have a life outside of work, please don't. To them, you don't have a life outside of work. -You have NO privacy. So what they say online about remote jobs being monitored is 100% true. -All of the above - have been instructions given by a company that are contracted with ICS (Deloitte) but ICS was not supposed to be on the contract in the first place (per Loyal Source Governemt Solutions) so they just went with it like a puppet and couldn't argue. -ICS is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau."

Being an international student and working in the US, there are a lot of challenges with respect to employment and visa status . Infinite hired at a yearly salary in the range of $55,000-$60,000. The work with the client was very hectic as the bar set by Infinite to Client is very high and the employees were severely underpaid. This same line of work gets you atleast 85k-90k annually in the specified location. They offer sponsorship which is a great option for International students, but the horrible part was, they didn’t want to pay the minimum wage as per the LCA because it was a significant increase from what they were paying and instead asked the employees to relocate to remote counties/states on a 2 day notice as the LCA minimum pay for those areas is less and didn’t care if the employees had to commute 3hrs for work daily due to their demand of relocation . Also had some of my ex- colleagues getting fired in the midst of their H1-B filing as they had too increase their pay too. The communication of firing was given on literally the same day just 2 hours before the End of the business day. On asking the reason, the managers redirected to HR’s and Senior HR who ghosted and didn’t respond and started the blame game. No relieving letter and no communication whatsoever, just a minute call and an email to ask for the return of the laptop.

Just say NO Thanks.,Computer Lab Technician,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","San Ramon, CA",Not a single positive thing can be said of these people.,"First they lied to me to get me to accept the position. It was never a ""contract to hire"". Second they screwed me over when I became eligible for company benefits and made me wait another 6 months. Third, they tried six or seven times to demand that I allow them to rip up my contract so they could cut my pay. Finally I was told today that my job had ended, only nobody from Infinite ever bothered to email or call me about this. I am unemployed and not one of those morons bothered to let me know. It is their job as my employer. They have known for days. Nobody has written or called me to say I was done, or thanks for all your work, or even screw you. Absolutely the worst agency I have ever had the displeasure to work for. You are not a person to them, just money and a number."

And they went out of their way to sign employees up for every type of insurance known to man, just so they could make money off of it.  
These people also used real payroll data from real employees/contractors to perform some internal software tesing, and that data got stolen.  So they had to pay for 2 years of fraud monitoring for their employees."

There are a select few who work hard and are generally likeable, but the rest sit on their computer all day and give assistance only begrudgingly. There is a high level of incompetence in the Technician level. Several times I have been able to answer more technical questions as an Operator than the Technician was able. Essentially, a hierarchy based not on merit was established shortly after 2015 when the team was put together. Many of these people have horrible attitudes, are incompetent for the job (not even saying they are dumb, just simply not fit for the job), and resistant to doing any actual work. The management receives zero input from employees based on staffing, there is zero penalty for careless or lazy conduct (a few Technicians arrive late to work every single day with no consequences), and there is zero employee review. The company image is being tarnished by a few of these individuals to the point that our client has specifically named some of them. 

This dynamic leads to those who have true talent being stuck at operator or low level technician level, where they are hindered from any real positive effect on the company, and the incompetent people filling the upper roles."

Workers hours/minutes per task are measured way more closely that needed. It is possible that the only way to get your 8 hours per day is to work through your breaks.
Pay is very low for the level of work that you are doing, and basically no raises. This is probably because they figure they can get someone to do the job (if they did not hire you). And they know that there is some ""draw"" for workers who are willing to work for low salary if they know they are working as a vendor for a large IT company.

Pactera,1.0,"Feb 19, 2019",Worst job I ever had,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,,Your working schedule for the most part is pretty flexible and there is free coffee and tea provided while you work. You can also generally eat food at your desk too.,"Overall: Poor management, Minimum wage, Employees treated poorly, No advancement opportunities, Impartial treatment to employees, Very disorganized.

Parking: Every day, you will have to go up to reception and ask for a parking pass to place in your car and then return at the end of the day.

Working Environment:
For the most part you will be in the open area in a shared desk, but some teams are contained inside small rooms, with surveillance cameras to monitor you.

Major Cons:
I noticed there is high turn over here. Many people quit within a matter of a few months or less.

I already had a big first red flag during my interview, when I went in for an interview and they did not know that I was supposed to be there, even though the email specified a time and a date to come in, which I was blamed for afterwards for coming in without an ""official"" invite and was then told to wait for two hours before being seen and then after was rushed through an interview.

There's a lot of finger pointing here, and I felt I was consistently criticized for every single ""mistake"" I made, which sometimes they were not mistakes but new rules made that don't reflect on the work you did in the past that were correct in that time and none of your work is ever appreciated nor is good work appreciated. When I first started, I was told by management how to do things a certain way. Then they changed how they wanted to do it later, and then when the higher ups did not approve of the work the way that we were taught to do it, we were blamed for making many ""mistakes"" even though that was how we learned how to do it. If they change the rules and don't like it, you will be blamed first.

I was constantly harassed and picked on during multiple team meetings, where management would specifically ridicule me in front of everyone saying that my work was bad, when it was the responsibility of everyone and not just me, and I felt targeted personally. My name was mentioned many times in front of everyone and other times I was pointed out like ""YOU made that mistake"" pointing at me or so on, which I felt was not professional in any way. I believe private matters should be handled apart from team meetings, or if there is an announcement to make to everyone it should be in regards to the whole team rather than targeting an individual.

I also felt that many people made comments and assumptions about me due to my race, and I was often asked about my race which I felt was inappropriate in a work environment.

Management also treats coworkers unequally and management mentioned she wanted someone else to review my work because she trusts her more than me (in front of me) and I felt like I have been putting in my hard work and treated poorly, more so than my coworkers so the management gives impartial treatment to all of the people on the team.

Management does not keep track of what work they have assigned to you, and keeps giving out more and more work for you to do without realizing what has been completed and will accuse you of not completing the work when realizing the amount they sent you was more than others.

I was also asked to do unpaid work and training at home and they insisted on doing unpaid work at home, which doesn't seem right especially as an hourly paid employee. When I tried to ask if I can work on it in office, they avoided answering completely. It often feels that they do not respect your time outside of work nor at work nor you as a person.

Some teams will let you work remotely/at home, but some due to privacy reasons will require you to work on site, with all your belongings locked up.

Very unorganized workplace, with no one knowing anything and no one knowing who does or did what and this company gave out the impression that they do not care about their employees at all.

Not worth the low pay and stress in my opinion. 

Overall worst job I ever had and felt devalued as a human being and employee here. 

If you can, do not work here!"
Pactera,1.0,"Jul 10, 2017",Everything was just a mess,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"My in-office coworkers were (mostly) really lovely people who did their best to help me when upper management couldn't or wouldn't be there to assist me. I actually liked a lot of the work, was very good at it, and enjoyed being considered an expert in certain aspects of my job due to my relative seniority in the department. My work schedule was totally flexible and I could adjust as needed for traffic or other anomalies in a given day. When I had ongoing health issues one summer, I was allowed to take unpaid time to recover. I was promoted after only nine months and given what seemed at the time like a significant raise (more on that in the cons section), and I did gain experience in team management early in my career that I am grateful for. Most of my subordinates were wonderful people who I enjoyed working with and I am grateful for their patience despite my inexperience in management. I had decent health insurance, and was able to add my wife onto my benefits with no issues. I was able to work from home pretty much whenever I wanted, which was convenient. No one cared what I wore, so my wardrobe was extremely casual. Also, I got so good at my job that I was able to get work done while doing background reading and writing.","First of all, Google ""Stevenson v. Pactera"" - I was one of the team members affected by this incident, and while I appreciate the settlement check, I can't stress enough how shady it was to have us as 1099 contractors to avoid paying benefits. We were converted to W2 employees fairly soon after I was hired, but I know that some of the others had been there for many months before that happened. Also, I was originally stationed in a satellite office, and eventually when the team dwindled to a handful of people we were shoved into a tiny back room and expected to work despite ongoing loud noise from the team who took over our old office (the walls were thin). This back room was mostly windows, which meant that during the summer months it became almost unbearably hot, and we couldn't open the windows or have fans because the ambient noise would have affected our ability to do our jobs. I'm fairly sure I could have reported the company for inhumane working conditions or something similar (I was wearing a T-shirt and thin pants and still leaving the office drenched in sweat every day), but I was terrified of being fired and suspected nothing would be done even if I did say something.

Once I was promoted to a management position and moved to the main area office, I hoped things would improve, which in some ways they did. I received a small raise with the promotion...which I later found out was 70% of what the person who had previously held my position (a man) had been making, as well as hilariously under market rate and barely above minimum wage. I never got any more raises, even though I was (as mentioned) very good at my job and the only person in office who remembered several processes that had become outdated while I worked here (but which I was expected to remember and use if asked). When I asked for a raise and presented evidence that I was being severely underpaid, I was strung along for awhile and then told that no one in the company had received raises in the last year.

I also received no sick pay, vacation, or holiday pay. I continued to be listed in the system as a lower-level/contract employee and no one noticed despite my having been in a managerial position for a year and a half. No one ever bothered to explain to me how any of these worked, or whether I was in fact supposed to be getting them at all. I swear that once I entered in holiday hours and they were accepted, but I tried this on the last federal holiday before I left the company and was informed a few days later that I did not qualify for holiday pay and would have to remove those hours from the system. I have since been told that asking employees not to come in AND not to be paid for missing a federal holiday is unusual, especially for a full-time management position. On my last day, I waited until the end of the day to log my hours in the system and found myself totally locked out. (I believe this was resolved, as my final paycheck was the appropriate amount, but at the time it was distressing as I did work the entire day.)

I worked on either the in-office desktop computer, or a personal laptop that I purchased to use when I was working from home. At no point was I given a company laptop, and my repeated attempts to ask my managers for help acquiring one were shrugged off. I could have pushed harder for one, but by the time I realized that not having one was unusual (several months into my management position), I had begun to realize that almost no one in the office was interested in making sure I had the tools I needed. I also, somehow, was the only employee in the office who didn't get a proper badge - I may have been out sick that day but I continued to use the same keycard that I'd been given on my move-in day and no one ever bothered to check up on that. After the fact, one of my coworkers pointed out that without the official badge, I could easily have been locked out had my old keycard been disabled on a whim. Was there not a record of my keycard being “missing”? That seems like a ridiculous security risk to me.

Upper management was frequently either absent or difficult to reach – the person who was meant to be my ""manager"" was in-office maybe one day a week and didn't often respond to emails or messages. I had several other people who acted as managers to me, but while they did their best to help, they frequently left or were moved to another team within a few months, leaving me without guidance once again. I worked with overseas management more frequently, especially in the last year or so of my employment. I hold no grudges against them, but they had a tendency to prioritize ridiculous client demands and company policies over the reality of certain situations, and repeated many of the same talking points when I tried to push back. I was given zero management training and very little guidance and mostly left to my own devices in these respects. (Frankly, if my job had been taken by someone less conscientious, this department could have descended into chaos much sooner.)

I had repeated conflicts with several subordinates, in multiple cases receiving messages and emails with abusive language regarding both myself and the company. I never felt truly unsafe, but rarely was I given assistance in handling these issues. I always tried to argue in the best interests of my team, but was frequently overruled or ignored. I felt pressure both from the team to voice their concerns to upper management, and from upper management to deliver the (frequently) bad news about new policies or procedural changes. I did not get the sense that I had any real power at all in the situation.

My job required that I have a reasonably quiet environment; however, I was forced to move desks several times within a year and each time I found the ambient noise more disruptive to my work. At first I was placed in the same open office as a large team who would sometimes chat with each other and occasionally get rowdy, but were mostly quiet; I then moved to a smaller room where several employees had desk phones and were answering them multiple times a day. Finally, I ended up in the middle of another open office, at a desk that was very close to the employee break room, which had no door and no way of muffling the sound from within. Employees frequently went in there to play pool, chat, take phone calls, and even play video games throughout the workday. I understand some of these things will happen, but the noises from the video games and pool actively impeded my ability to do my job. It was literally the only room in the office without a door and I still don’t understand that architectural decision. 

I became so stressed due to the low wages and absurd job expectations that I developed a variety of health issues in the last few months I worked there, including a stomach ulcer and ongoing chest pains caused by anxiety that lasted for several days. In the case of the latter, I was in such pain that I was unable to sleep properly and had to go to the ER in the middle of the night. I believe this job impacted my health significantly."

First of all do not join this company at any cost, No doubt that they will give you more salary you can't even expect that but do not come in their sugar quoted words. At any point of time no one will support you ever be it senior level your reporting manager, team manager or even the HRs. This is a big fraud company who follow hire and fire policy. They hire people for only for 6-8 months and then they put their employees on PIPs and ask them to complete an unachievable target which anyone will not be able to do. No one here gives respect to sales people. Recruiters are king here, they can do work from home anytime and they can take as many leaves as they want because they have less salaries but sales person have no right to do work from home, they have to come even on a natural disaster situations. Egoistic management, arrogant management. their ego gets hurt when you put down your papers or you are leaving and they treat you like their slaves. So incase if you have any other offer inhand then go for that only. This company will never provide you career growth. Never do increment, Increment policy - only after 2 years that too in October or Novemeber, They will give you false hope that they will call you Onsite and all but trust me nothing will happen. They will scold you every day for not achieving your weekly targets and with the name of punishment they will call you on saturdays when no one is coming but you only you will come. Worst culture. Zero level of employee satisfaction. Not even a single get together will be conducted. You come you see dead faces in front of you looking into their systems and then go. No interaction between any employees also they will not provide you any training. You have to learn from your own.
If you are from solutions background then do involve in recruitment because this is totally a recruitment agency, this is not a solution company. Initially they will ask you that sell solutions but after 1 or 2 weeks they will ask you to sell recruitment for your survival. They have no Salary criteria for any level of people, your junior will be taking more salary with zero knowledge.
Diwali giftings is just Rs.501. No extra gift not even a single sweets.
Major one is Salary Delay- They will give you salary after 15th of every month infact they have policy of crediting the salary between 7-10 but they don't follow their own policy. 
There are more cons but I want to conclude that this is a worst company to join. If you wanna see worst culture in corporate sector then join this company otherwise take your time sit unemployed but do not join this company."

Much lip service to company values and transparency, but no improvements have been seen. People are not encouraged to be open with opinions and honest in town hall meetings. Upper managers try to control the message and focus on keeping the lower levels from discussing issues of great importance. Speaking to HR in the past has been useless as HR was always biased and not willing to truly listen. With change in staff, there is hope this will change.   Very little opportunity to actually meet and talk to our customers, this is a privilege kept for very few. And those few greatly abuse travel opportunities.

Other pros include great benefits, flexible schedules, used to be cool events and liberty to travel pre-pandemic, some really great people to work with (also some not great people). I will also give SITA credit for trying to make certain shortcomings better (but oftentimes it's too bureaucratic to follow through).","SITA is an old legacy company that often rests on its long-standing reputation and relationships with airlines. As a salesperson, this gets you in the door, but then when it boils down to the technology it can and should be much stronger. Oftentimes the only way you can be successful in sales is to have one of the biggest airport or airline accounts. Sales is really hard here. Pricing and proposal processes are unnecessarily difficult to the point where sometimes I'm scared to put together a pricing proposal, it's such a headache. Also SITA's portfolio is so gigantic that salespeople can't specialize in any one area and are spread very thin."

Great company to work with if you are a citizen.","If you are not a US citizen and are on a visa, then you might have a difficult time getting help from the immigration team. The process is very slow and there is no guarantee that you will get help on time. Unfortunately, there is only one person handling the immigration for both US and Canada.
Especially if you on F1 student visa, I'd be more careful because there is a high chance of not receiving the documents needed to submit to college on time or not receive them at all. 
Since being on a visa, we run against time, it is important to get responses and help in time. It is important to be transparent with the process and what is happening especially during these COVID times. 
It is not fair to put employees in a limbo about their status and wait until their work authorization expires and then terminate eventually."

The company's roots were a cooperative type of organizational structure to the airlines in the late 1940's where they developed and implemented their international network infrastructure.  Today, they recognize that they are a viable business and need to operate like one.","Because of their origin, SITA struggles to be able to turn the company into an agile, lean run company.

Voyager is a disaster, though management says it delivered ""on time and on budget"", which was a bald faced lie. The new finance system is a disaster, with no good data available to help manage the business.  No career opportunities for those inside.  Few to no raises. They reorg every year, as a way to wallpaper over the lack of business performance and issues within the businesses. But they never follow through on the reorganizations to make the current organization effective, before they reorg again.  So over the last 6-7 years, the company has become progressively less effective. And morale is absolutely horrible.  Either the CEO is blind to the problems, or there is a very effective filter of all issues that keeps him from being aware (which is cultivated by the fact that he is very volatile and loses his temper with his senior team a lot).

A surprising number of people who do leave return after a few years. Periodically they have hiring freezes, despite the open listings on the career page.","The company moves at it's own pace, and HR is no exception. Don't be surprised if things go quiet for several weeks before you get an offer, just keep in touch with HR to make sure is on track. Once you do get in, you will find that the low turnover means few opportunities to advance in your local team.

Also, they are dealing with the crisis very well and doing an excellent job of communicating with everyone in the company about what is going on.

Ample vacation time.
Laid back management relationship first name basis with sr level directors vp's etc.","Sales tends to promise first and ask questions later placing delivery people in difficult positions with the customers, which is then blamed on the delivery staff. 
Customer satisfaction reviews are often confusing to  customers with multiple lines of business.

SITA,5.0,"Jan 21, 2017",Manager,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","Atlanta, GA","If one can survive the announced layoffs that are coming up (Jan-Mar, 2017) and one can stomach knowing they work for a company that drastically reduced its severance package policy AFTER making the announcement, then things should be pretty good although very, very busy since there is always a huge amount of work and now there will be less people to do it.  There was a reduction of 300 (out of 4500+) that was just announced (Jan 2017) but they also mentioned moving an undetermined number of roles to 'lower cost' areas over time which most people would interpret as there being less jobs in Atlanta and more in India.

In addition to the new CEO who apparently has done this before (e.g. come in and layoff people), our part of the company also has a new VP that reports to a new VP (which is not uncommon... contrbuter>manager>director>VP>VP>CEO).  This was also something that the new CEO indicate was needed: flattening.  I have never worked at a company that 80+ VPs (although I imagine that number will be reduced fairly soon).

Given that the company is not doing anywhere near as well as the big three GDS' who dominate the market (Amadeus, Sabre, Travelport), none of this is surprising.  It will suck for those who get laid off (which may include yours truly) and it will be stressful for those that are left, but long-term it should be a good thing.

The company is actually a great place to work and the people are extremely knowledgeable about the airline industry and its customer needs.  However, personally, for those thinking about coming here, I would wait until the dust settles and then see how the re-org is working out (stayed tuned here as I am sure the survivors will be able to share more afterwards).

PROS

Great people
Great airline industry knowledge","Certain high-priced horribly run projects that led us to where we are.

Silos around the world and redundancies of certain solutions.

Change of severance policy right before laying off 100's of workers (legal but perceived as unethical and unfair by most (including those who think they will remain)).

Certain people (and pockets of people) have a 9 to 4 mentality which is probably another reason we are in the boat we are in.

Certain people (and pockets of people) have to go the extra mile (and do) to make up for the previously mentioned people which is probably why the need for layoffs didn't happen sooner."
SITA,1.0,"Mar 31, 2016",Terrible place to work,Analyst,Former Employee,"Atlanta, GA","Sita has good benefits - medical, dental, 401K, and covered parking","Sita has more people managing, and few people working- so nothing gets done correctly. Managers seem to be on a mission to discredit employees - even when they are good workers. This is to help them have a bell curve during review time. HR always supports management 100%. The quality of products that we sell to customers, always have problems. No one knows how to solve the problem because they are pointing their finger at someone else.

A reorganization which then drags on for months, while every employee is left wondering who is next? In N. America, SITA reduced the maximum severance by 6 months, in advance of letting people go. So much for loyalty to employees.
SITA frequently struggles to remain relevant to the ATI customer demands, being too late to market in far too many instances, and then confused over why SITA sales get stagnant. Far more insidious is the deep silo mindset, with blame going everywhere,except to senior leadership, when Customers demand to get what they have paid for.  downsizing, reorganizing of work centers, hiring new, younger faces, with outsourcing is seen as the new solution to everything.

I get along with the people I work with.","About 50% of the management staff are email forwarders,  told to me by a senior manager, and boy does it show.

They can't seem to get any qualified managers.
Ex: 
There is a woman working near me as a QA manager. She is a contractor who was promised full time at 6 months. Her SITA manager left, and they hired someone else to fill that role. Turns out the person in that role had already delegated ALL of their work to the contractor. So, SITA never actually needed that position. They filled it anyways. The person they filled it with has done nothing for 6 months now. Has shown no interest in doing anything. The contractor lady is STILL doing all the work... and now 1 and1/2 years in she is still a contractor. So they demoralized the contractor, and they are paying a 100k+ salary out for no reason.

Talk about being good at destroying the morale of productive employees.

----

They don't seem to have ANY idea at all how to manage technical workers or projects. The company has been doing  Agile for 2 years now, but management didn't take Agile training, and are STILL trying to run things by giving priority to whomever screams the loudest, and STILL want to operate under a waterfall style overall.

EX:
The project manager who is supposed to be prioritizing our work still cannot read our agile board or run reports on their own. After a year, and a lot of effort on our part. They need to be spoon fed everything. This manager, still doesn't seem to understand that the job is to prioritize our work. There are sites all over the world competing for our time. There is always a lot more work than we can do, and this person can't seem to figure out how to choose who comes first. This manager just asks them what they want, and then tells us. 

EX:
We deliver software early in the year, and they don't test it until late in the year, then they all lose their minds, and need everything fixed immediately, so they can get credit for delivering on their contracts, and we can get paid. This manager cannot figure out how to MANAGE that and get the sites to test the software when they get it.

The CEO made a lot of noise on turning Avaya into a Destination Place To Work, but at the same time was taking steps to slash the workforce. I found that to be disingenuous as most employees were constantly looking over their shoulders, afraid of the next round layoffs. That has left most employees with a trust issue with the CEO.

Cloudflare,1.0,"Mar 4, 2024",Beware,Account Manager,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,Good product. Some good people.,"Where to begin? 

-Territories are assigned with absolutely no thought process behind them. How your territory performs is truly luck of the draw. You will also get accounts taken out of your territory with little to no notice. 
-There is no incentive to build long lasting relationships with your customers due to this. Instead there is a mentality of close whatever you can while you can. 
-There is no CSM/CSE aligned to any of your accounts. They all use a pool model. Customers hate the support system and complain that they get rude replies or it takes them weeks to get a response. On top of that, many CSEs are overworked and overbooked. 
-In Mid Market, you will be working with 20 different SE's, just depending on which one is assigned to which account of yours. You have to prep each SE for every customer call you invite them to. Many SE's are not seasoned - they have very low sales skills and rely on you completely as the AE to tell them when to speak. They have no curiosity to help find out more about the customers problems. You'll be lucky if they don't hinder the process, never mind help move it along. 
-If a partner brings a deal to Cloudflare, that customer is locked in with that partner forever. As a sales person you are de-incentivized from moving the customer to a different partner or moving them direct (even if it is what the customer directly asks for). This creates partner relationships where the partner can coast and add no value, yet still make their margin on upsells when the AE does all the work. It also creates dissatisfaction with the customer as they feel they're overpaying for partner services for nothing in return. 
-Sales reps are required to handle renewals even though they do not get paid for them. God forbid you need to make changes to the renewals or the customer wants to downgrade some of their services; internal processes make that incredibly difficult and complex. 
-You can pretty much make pricing anything you want it to be as a rep, which means customers are left confused on what pricing they can expect. One rep may extend a discount of 70% to a customer, and that will be the expectation when they are moved to a different rep even years down the line, creating dissatisfaction and lack of trust with the new rep that can no longer get that high of a discount approved. 
-Customers complain of lack of visibility/transparency when it comes to pricing. 
-Managers are hit/miss but overall I've noticed they are not very experienced, have not seen best practices at other companies, and aren't super helpful in advocating for their reps. 
-Layoffs for no defendable reason, letting go talented reps who haven't even gotten a chance to fully ramp and who receive positive feedback in performance reviews
-You may get hired for one role and in 6 months be told you're covering a completely different patch and type of customer
-Pay is below average
-Severance for layoffs is extremely minimal 
-no 401k match
-rising costs for the healthcare plans
-CEO is toxic, inexperienced in building strong sales organizations/processes, and regularly belittles sales org
-Many folks have left due to questionable unethical business practices, management issues, favoritism, and other worse issues... It is a widespread issue across all geographies and teams.

Cloudflare,4.0,"Oct 19, 2023",Nice company with room for growth,Program Manager,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",,- competitive base salary - good tech - lots of room for exponential customer growth - fresh ideas that challenge the status quo are welcome,- equity is low - no bonuses - no 401K match - no budget for events or travel
Cloudflare,1.0,"Jan 11, 2024",You Are Set Up To Fail Within The Sales Org,Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,- Great Product and benefits.,"The morale at CF has been in the gutter since the CEO publicly shamed the sales org last year & with the 2024 layoffs. Alongside the consistent fear of wondering if this is going to be your last day at your job, the sales ops and processes behind the scenes are some of the worst I've seen in all of the tech space. For each deal, you spend more time processing a deal than actually being customer-facing. The leadership team said they were aware of the issue and were going to focus on simplifying the process, but it's gotten much, much worse. 

Along with the layoffs in 2024, I have heard that BDR's who got promoted to AE beginning of Q4 were also let go. They had little to no training in the role & with an average sales cycle of over 6 months, it is almost impossible to hit their number, let alone get established in the role. Also, BDR team leads were demoted to BDR's, and AE managers were demoted to AE. 

During my tenure, I have NEVER SEEN executive leadership or the CRO chat with any of the immediate sales team or gain first-hand insights from individual reps on what's working and what's not. It's quite pathetic, to be honest. Ethier the CEO, COO, or CRO chooses to be ignorant of how much of a mess the SalesOrg is or just not care because they don't believe in sales in general. Plus, I have also never seen so many reps who were quota crushers at their previous company struggle to hit even 30% of their number. 99% of reps are great sellers, and greater people of character, but the sales culture is so much of a mess that you are not enabled to do your best work. 

And, when you cut INCREDIBLE SALES folks who have been within the Cloudflare culture and who have taught other new sales folk how to do your job, the employees that you will replace will have even a GREATER CHALLENGE to their role, causing even more issues. Has any of this been properly thought out?! 

Bottom line- You are set up to fail within the CF sales org. When the CEO takes pride pubically in individually hand-crafting and sending offer letters to every single new employee, there is also a weight of responsibility of taking accountability for your actions when you don't provide teams the culture and foundation to do their best work. I hope that executive leadership sees the challenges FIRST HAND within the sales org & acts fast, or it's going to be more ""putting lipstick on a pig"" and wondering why things aren't getting better."

When I started there was a ""lead with empathy"" attitude by everyone. Now, and especially since new CRO Marc Boroditsky came in, it's much more fear based and robotic. Marc began subtly reducing AE's compensations in sneaky ways and certainly got the ball rolling for Matthew's embarrassing Q1 '23 earnings call where he literally called all of his success from the last 10 years solely because of the strength of the product (Matthew doesn't care about sales people at all FYI).

- Unlimited PTO goes well with zero accountability culture","First thing I need to highlight is the engineering culture is highly toxic, during my time at CF, I've encountered the following:
- High confrontation (getting yelled at publicly in meetings, getting massive downvotes and negative emojis in chat threads when folks don't agree with you, lack of respect for people as humans)
- Gaslighting (after raising concerns about a teammate's behavior towards me in meetings and code reviews, manager literally just responded with ""don't take it personally, they're just trying to attack the problem"" - classic tiptoeing response to avoid addressing respect and empathy)
- No concept of ""disagreeing and committing"", a lot of engineers at CF are smart, but are jerks. There's a lot of folks who are credible in terms of their individual talent, but certainly are not likeable. When a decision has been made, instead of respecting and committing to the decision, I've seen and was horrified by the unprofessionalism directed towards the decision makers.

Another big problem that I've experienced that continues to be an issue at CF is lack of valuing employees:
- Low compensation (I made it a big concern that I was not fairly compensated, especially when CF's stock plummeted, I made a case that I could literally go anywhere else and have my TC doubled, I was told off both by my management chain and by HR, so guess what? I interviewed and found a new role that doubled my TC.)
- Deceit (a huge red flag when I initially joined was that the recruiter I was working with flat out lied about how he didn't know what my level will be when I joined, he also mumbled something along the lines of ""we don't do levels at CF"" - this was downright false, and I was brought in a P3, when the level that matched my experience was supposed to be P4)

Unless you're particularly excited about CF's mission, I would avoid at all costs. Even if I didn't receive another offer, I would have needed to leave soon since my mental health was deteriorating based on what I experienced above."

Q1, they started pushing a territory model in which most BDRs weren't given accounts/territory until the middle of Q1, leaving a month and a half to hit an entire quota. - Same issue into Q2, poor implementations of Salesloft with little to no help getting onboarded but still expected to hit a full quota, which had also increased drastically.

Tata Communications,2.0,"May 25, 2012","Great CEO, mediocre pay, zero process",Director,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Herndon, VA","Tata Communications has some great strengths - 

1. The CEO, Vinod Kumar is a great leader and someone who instills confidence. The company is still loss making (in May 2012) and had just turned EBITDA positive, but the employees are overall hopeful under his leadership that the company will turn the corner before the shareholders lose patience.

2. The Tata group culture is evident with its high standard of ethics and values, though this is clearly stronger in India than in other countries.

3. The company has a great asset base - its cable infrastructure, its infrastructure base in India, its reputation within the service provider community

4. It has some great people, who are largely non-political and whom you feel good about working with.","The company is struggling with some significant downside risks:

1. The level below the CEO - the top 30 managers of the company (called the G30) are a diverse bunch of people with varying levels of competence, politics and values. There are some solid people who deliver upon what the company was known for and there are some newcomers hired in the last 2 years who have brought in a culture of cutting corners and expediency. This layer is very political, with lots of infighting and good skill in positioning themselves, rather than doing good work. 

2. The lack of process is plain to see for anyone. Where there is some process, it seems to have been put in by some evil bumbling bureaucrat - so onerous and misguided, that people mostly look for ways to avoid it. In recent years several senior people have been hired to bring in process rigour, but the lack of process has prevailed - and it seems to be a graveyard for those senior 'business excellence' executives.

3. The salaries are mediocre and pay scales are pegged to the 50th percentile. This may work in India, where the Tata brand is strong and people buy into that as a compensation to lower salaries, but internationally it means that Tata Communications attracts some rather mediocre talent who cling onto the company for dear life"

I've often heard about how painfully under resourced the Russian space program used to be, but I'm rather certain that if we brought a Russian tech worker to this company, they would say things might be bad in Russia, but not this bad :)

Bottom line is this - where the main corporation may or may not be totally healthy (and I have no idea on the status of this) - my position was part of the organization which at this point is kind of like a ghost ship. Nearly all experts have left the company over the past few years, and they're not being replaced by new ones.

Pros include:
* Fair compensation
* Smart engineers
* Good tech infrastructure
* Very stable company
* Cool products","* Very poor work life balance. The lights never turn off at this company. There are always people working, always messages flying around. I’ve seen engineers being asked to work late even when they’re sick. The work here comes first, then employees second. It's a very demanding environment.
* Can be very chaotic. Sometimes it feels like everything is “on fire"". This is particularly true in the Risk & Fraud space, since fraud attacks can occur at any time, and thus require immediate attention from engineering.
* Many concurrent, tight deadlines leads to a stressful environment which results in many bugs in production. There's never enough time to go back and fix these bugs, since there's always a new, high priority initiative.
* The culture (or lack thereof) is not great here. There simply isn’t time to do anything else other than work on the next high priority initiative. 

The main issue with Intuit is that they prioritize speed over quality. If they would slow down a little bit, they would produce better quality features that result in less customer friction + allow their engineers to fix existing issues."

Intuit has a good reputation for being innovative, customer-centric, and socially responsible. Intuit also has a great work culture that fosters collaboration, diversity, and learning. Intuit employees enjoy flexible work arrangements, competitive pay and benefits, and opportunities for growth and development.","However, Intuit is not a perfect company, and it has its share of challenges and drawbacks. Some of the common complaints from Intuit employees are:

Poor work-life balance: Intuit can be very demanding and stressful, especially during the peak seasons and product launches. Intuit employees often have to work long hours, weekends, and holidays, and deal with tight deadlines and high expectations. Intuit employees also report feeling burned out, overwhelmed, and underappreciated.
Political and bureaucratic"
Intuit,5.0,"Feb 19, 2024",Yes - It's really as great as the reviews say it'll be!,QuickBooks Live Senior Expert Bookkeeper,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Rochester, NY","I was skeptical about the good reviews I'd seen and assumed the benefits were better-geared toward PT or FT team members but even as a select-time employee, I am blown away with the benefits. Not only is this paying significantly more than my last role, they've provided me with all equipment needed to do my job and I even get reimbursed for my internet expenses, which was just icing on the cake! There are so many opportunities to earn time-and-a-half pay and we are included in things like getting PTO for our birthday and the annual shut down week. To my surprise, even those benefits are more than I was expecting bc my normal work day is only a 6 hr shift but everyone gets paid for 8 hrs during that time! My leads and manager have been amazing to work with and even though you're WFH in this role, they still go above and beyond to make you feel included in a team. I am working my dream schedule and can take whatever time off I need without feeling chastized or having to come back from vacation to a mountain of work and I also don't have to be responsible to ""cover"" anyone else's shift if/ when they are out. I'm sure that could change depending on your role but for me, this is exactly what I wanted. There are no silly or stupid questions here and everyone is more than willing to go above and beyond to help you feel supported. I couldn't have made a better choice than to give it a try and put my hat in the ring for my dream job - I'm so glad I did!","You DO have to be willing to go with the flow, a bit. Because Intuit takes so much pride in improving as much as possible, there are some instances where there might be little notice to you, your leads or managers about things like a new training, a system update or the need to step up and help out another department. That being said, there is SUCH an emphasis put on the idea of ""here is what we know, so far and we'll get through this as a TEAM"" that you know you're not alone and it all works out. IMO, this keeps things interesting and allows you to learn new things you maybe wouldn't have put yourself out there for previously but I do see where this could be a bit off-putting for some people."

It's great if you want to work during the colder months of the year and have your summers off. Totally remote. Very flexible. Intuit invests a lot in training. Good equipment and great support. Pay is comparable to offers I got for local in office work. You can get up pretty fast from entry level to lead and even manager.,You never really know when you return in September or later in December if you are seasonal.

I look forward to the daily huddles I can attend because the team insight is also helpful.,The training I went through focused more on the BOE role and less on the FOE role. Everyone in that training was going to be a FOE. I had to learn quickly on the job the things training didn't cover.

Intuit,3.0,"Aug 20, 2023",Great - if you like staying in your box.,Senior Principal Technical Program Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"Whether I would recommend Intuit to a friend largely depends on their priorities and what excites them. Intuit does offer fantastic benefits and general culture is open and inclusive. Earning potential is high. If you're a person who likes wearing a single hat and staying in your lane, you'll do great. If you're more of the type who likes to take risks, work beyond what you're asked and drive change, you'll be disappointed.","Agility, speed, risk and being willing to do the right thing are spoken but not truly part of the Intuit culture. Intuit does not provide opportunity for people who work beyond their job role. They'll gladly take advantage of it but don't expect to be recognized with job advancement. The people who go above and beyond by doing more than their role requires and challenging status quo, consistently say they feel their skills are eroding due to the limitations and lack of opportunity. Getting ahead at Intuit is more about being liked and who you know rather than the actual value you deliver. Change agents be ware of the cultural constraints. Intuit does not like people who challenge the status quo even when they agree with the direction."
Intuit,4.0,"Feb 4, 2024",Not Challenging - Good for the Corporate Climber ,Marketing Manager,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Sydney,"The Sydney office has a great view and is well equipped with standing desks. 
There’s some really good people who work here but they all tend to leave as it’s not challenging enough and too political.
If you play the game well you can get promoted but it’s a lot of jumping through hoops and playing the social game which may be for some but not those wanting to affect real change.","A graveyard of ‘has-beens’ with very slow processes and old school ways of thinking.

Therefore the benefits offered to Full Time employees (Managers and above) are far greater than to Select Time employees that work 40 hour weeks. - Training is good but training makes it seem like all clients will be simple. Reality is that clients vary drastically and not everything can be covered in training that you can/will experience on a team. - There is no ""ramp up"" for work. As soon as you are placed on a team you can get 20-40 clients immediately. It can be daunting but you have support"

Handsome RSUs - almost equivalent to your CTC with refresh every year,"1. No fast paced learning for PMs as compared to Indian companies. No cutting edge mobile product dev. 2. Highly tech focussed B2B projects that require very few product interventions. PMs are merely doing the job of project managers, most of the time. 3. Odd working hours, your personal life goes for a toss. Most of the meetings are held in the late evening (as late as 10:30pm) since you have to work as per US stakeholders. There are hardly any meting on US late nights like India  4. Since customers are based out of US, Canada, PMs hardly connect or participate in discovery process or identification of customer pain points. Most of the requirements actually come from the business team and PMs here have to just execute the same. 5. Whole focus is to distribute goodies, plan off-sites and other events and not care about employee job feedback, pain points. Employees are rewarded for posting good things on LinkedIn. My Advice is that if you want to be a very small fish in a big pond then only join the organization."

The work culture is collaborative, fostering a sense of unity among team members.

Supportive Leadership: The management team is approachable and genuinely cares about employees' well-being. Regular check-ins and open communication channels make it easy to voice concerns.

Career Growth: Intuit prioritizes professional development. I've had the opportunity to attend various trainings and take on challenging projects that have significantly contributed to my skills and career growth.

Innovative Approach: Intuit encourages innovative thinking and values creative solutions. This has created an exciting and dynamic work environment.","Workload: At times, workloads can be demanding, requiring effective time management. However, this can also be seen as a testament to the Intuit's commitment to excellence.

Communication Channels: While overall communication is strong, improvement in interdepartmental communication could enhance efficiency."

Intuit,3.0,"Dec 26, 2023",Both good and bad aspects. ,Front End Developer,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Mountain View, CA","Excellent benefits. Health and dental and vision are all provided.

Mostly positive workplace culture. Yelling was rarely heard (in my department). 

Great pay. Ample vacation time. 

Campuses often have many things to do, and nice cafes for food. 

Co-workers are excellent and enjoyable to work with, with a high team spirit.","For engineering, quantity is often valued over quality. If you simply do the tasks assigned to you, that may not be enough, so having to ""find"" extra work is required. Managers may not know how to delegate effectively, and this may result in unexpected termination with zero severance. 

Work outside of normal hours may be expected as well. This may include waking up to alerts at 3am and being expected to join calls until problems are resolved. Part of the industry, but can ruin vacations. And this isn't optional. (Or paid.) 

Management is decent, but often has substantial communication limitations. As well, due to different cultural backgrounds, questions may be asked that are personal and violate the law. They may also manage meeting time exceptionally ineffectively and allow for countless hours of wasted time to occur. In short: way too many pointless meetings. They try hard, but are often not trained properly. 

The company does want to force Return to Office policies a few days of the week, which often results in people working in near empty buildings, thereby requiring wasted time and gas commuting--only to be on Zoom at work.

Keep in mind that it's a tax software company. A lot of the work can become excessively dull over time. It can be very rewarding at times, but also incredibly boring as well. Again ""tax software"" isn't the most fun type of business.

Despite all this, the benefits do outweigh the cons. At least for a while. From what I experienced, many do put in a few years, and then move on."

Uber,4.0,"Feb 17, 2024","Good Salary, Friendly People, Weak Management",Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Seattle, WA","The salary is top notch, even in the tech industry. Uber in the past has had a reputation for being an incredibly toxic place to work at. From what I've understand, they've undergone a transformation with the current CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. I've been here for 2+ years and I have not experienced that at all. All the people I've worked with are respectful. The work life balance is also quite good. I typically do not have to work more than 40h, except for on-call or an occasional deadline.","Uber has started to track diff count and other metrics for worker productivity, and it is an input to performance discussions. I often see diffs that are committed without testing or unnecessarily broken down just to meet quota requirements. It hurts quality without materially improving true productivity in my opinion.

I also feel like management is quite weak. My managers are all just people managers, assigning work to engineers and attending meetings. I don't see ownership in them to drive culture or engineering efficiency or product strategy. That stuff is pushed down to the engineers who are busy in the weeds. As a result, I see tons of examples of poor engineering design, incidents that happen due to lack of testing, and so on."
Uber,4.0,"Feb 25, 2024","Overall, I would recommend Uber",Recruiter,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","New York, NY","I have worked in different departments (the CEO in customer support and in TA as a recruiter) and can honestly say the people and culture was great in both orgs. Overall, some of the best people I have ever had the pleasure of working with in regards to not only my peers, but management as well.","I really don't have too many cons. I will say that I did not like how the layoffs were handled in June of 2023. For the longest time Uber employees were told not to fear about layoffs in 2023 in Talent Acquisition. While I understand these things happen, if there was any doubt that this was no longer true, a warning would have been appreciated. I spent 4 years at Uber and grew and learned so much. I felt that the company invested in me and I committed myself to do the same. I had every intention of staying at Uber. It is a shame that Uber let go of way too many talented people. Only allowing a month to find another role within the company was not enough time and the severance package was okay, but not great."

The pay is horrible, and they continue to make it worse. They do not care about drivers at all, because there is always some poor sap who thinks they can make a little extra money. I suppose if you only drive 100 miles a week which translates to maybe 90.00, then you still have to pay for the gas. It might be ok to make a few extra dollars, but that’s about it. Your car will be ruined if you drive regularly, and you won’t make enough to replace the car. Every year you drive you will have a tax loss, which can be beneficial. However, at the same time it shows how it is a losing proposition. It is unsustainable, unless you’re prepared to buy a new car every couple of years. I do know that in a few large cities there is more chance to make money. However, if you’re not making what you need, with an additional amount to save for a new car then you’re going backwards."

Leaders avoid taking on challenging tasks and improving processes, choosing instead to position themselves as heroes by implementing systems learned during their MBA studies at a third-tier school. Career progression is lacking, goals are unrealistic, there's consistent deception, layoffs occur, and there are insufficient tools and resources. The primary reasons people remain in my department are the favorable pay and benefits, and more significantly, the current state of the job market.

I paid $425/week during the winter and business had died, but Uber/Hertz doesn't care. When I received my final bill there was an extra $600 charge. Being platinum level brought higher paying trips, but starting at the bottom is lower pay. Uber customer support is a joke and does not care about driver safety (only about how they look). A scammer called posing as Uber support and wanted to confirm my vehicle, appearance, and how I greet passengers. I hung up and called Uber directly, but all they cared about was if they had my payout info, not that they were trying to identify me (a female driver). They said they put in extra securities to protect my money, but they didn't. Disgusted with the company itself, grateful for the summer pay (~$35/hr) though the winter pay (~$14/hr) hurts if you're unprepared/unaware."

Use of personal vehicle means high maintenance expenses. This also makes the job less viable as full time work, I would only recommend someone take this on as supplemental income to another job or as a short term solutions in between jobs.
Long hours can be tiring, which can lead to safety concerns.
Helpful benefits require more time put in, and can be easily lost if your monthly tier requirement is not met; even then most aren't very useful.
There is a slight language barrier with the outsourced support team which can make it difficult to properly explain and resolve issues; which also eats at time and can result in poor earnings for the hour.
Opportunities to make extra income during certain time frames have shifted to opt-in and are easy to miss.
Having to cancel an order due to circumstances outside of your control (e.g. early closure) will temporarily reflect negatively on your profile. These will often be reported several times before the order is actually canceled."

Uber provides high compensation and good benefits, the people are smart and supportive, and there is always work to be done. It is engaging. Like with many big companies, there is more work to be done than can get done. This is generally a good thing. It helps to stay engaged and to continually grow. The problem is when things try to move too fast and timelines, quality standards, and boundaries aren't managed correctly. Communicate well and it's overall a good situation.","Sometimes projects and initiatives try to move too fast and it comes at the cost of code quality and incidents. This isn't uncommon so just try to manage it, that's part of job anyway. I personally don't have an issue with the 50% RTO policy and code diff expectations. Some people do.

I’ve met several different pockets of people who I love working, are great at their jobs, genuinely care, and want to do the “right thing”. Find the right pocket of people to work with who can insulate you from the broader Palo ecosystem and you’ll have a great time.","The “Overall Palo” culture is pretty terrible… C-level management has a reputation for being REALLY harsh and not making much sense — people have to spend a LOT of time managing up to them. Terrible at internal comms and policies. Last year it was “FLEXWork is here to stay - we’re making a commitment to letting you work when and where you want, forever”. This year it’s “Managers must be in the office 3 days a week”. They have MASSIVELY bungled the comms and positioning of this roll out (not to mention policy is terrible). As far as “big company” things go — they’re terrible. I’ve never seen a large company where it takes this long to get something through the IT department, Legal, or “Pricing”.

Coming up in November, the leadership team is forcing us back into the office 3 days per week. They’re still trying to call it FlexWork by saying that you get to decide which 2 days you can work remotely. But all new job reqs say “on-site” not “hybrid.” I believe that’s probably because they want the option to force it back to 5 days per week without all the employees calling them liars all over again. Employees already did things like move far away, sell their cars, etc. because everyone really believed it when leadership said FlexWork was here to stay. It wasn't. I guess 3 days on-site is better than 5 though (and that's exactly what they hope we tell ourselves). They say it's because they hear that tons of people are craving in-person collaboration now that the pandemic is wrapping up. For those who want to work in the office, nothing is currently stopping them. So if they get to the office and then they're lonely because the office is empty, that's an indicator the majority of people are not craving in-person collaboration.","Before I started working here, a friend of mine told me: “You’ll probably work harder here than you’ve worked anywhere else in the past.” I’m not afraid of hard work, so I accepted the job offer. After I started, I realized that he didn’t mean the amount or difficulty of the actual work. He meant the effort to get the work done. There are so many obstacles in the way due to the strange way the company is organized, the lack of consistent process across different teams, the bad communication, and the inconsiderate way decisions are made. If you like to understand what’s happening and get your work done in a consistent/planned/predictable way, you’ll hate it. If you like chaos, you’ll enjoy it. If you just want a job and you don’t care if you like it or not, then it’s fine."

- The Inclusion & Diversity group should be renamed as the ""Woke Department"" since they only promote far-left topics, they enjoy bringing politics and other divisive topics into the workplace, plus justify and enable leaders that share controversial far-left comments in global channels (Slack). 
- Openly pro-abortion (CEO sent an email to all US employees about this)
- Openly pro trans kids agenda (I&D organized a ""support our trans youth"" event during business hours)
- The Women's Network Group is the most toxic feminist and aggressive group I've ever joined: through their global Slack group they openly attack other employees that don't share their views -or dare to post messages that don't share their values. The leadership only organizes events that feed their views, they don't care about female employees that don't agree with their perspective."

- Lack of setting up employees to succeed: prepare to learn a lot on your own and through mistakes, as you will wing everything blindly. There is not one page of any training anywhere to be found (e.g. everything is local knowledge), good luck!

There is also a poor time off structure (not as many Holidays or PTO as other comparable companies). Not to mention, often times employees don't feel able to take time off for any length of time due to being overloaded with work and extra challenging deadlines that need to be met on multiple projects.

Get it right the first time or be castigated is the status quo and strangely accepted by everyone.

Unrealistic workload expectations with a workaholic company culture with some employees even bragging about how late they had to stay up to work. 

You'll have no say into your own work. Do what the highest paid person in the room says to do, even if it completely contradicts previous directions from the exact same person.

This will drive you mad if you have any experience in b2b business development, channel sales, or brains in general…
Extremely disappointing to watch every good faith, hard earned sale get ultimately “No Start” because the client is disgusted with the implementation issues for so long they just pull the plug.  And ADP punishes a sales person for this- when the sales person has literally zero control over the implementation experience and technical aspects of that 20+ person team.
Sucks.

I am constantly surrounded by some of the brightest minds in the industry, and am able to receive hands-on training directly from the source. 

I've had the opportunity to work deals with exciting logos early in my career. 

The enablement is world-class. On both Product & the Technology Sector as a whole. 

I am compensated handsomely for the hard-work I put in. (Also DDOG Employee Stock hold a ton of value)

For example - If someone is looking for a role with the majority of their salary coming from base pay, New Business Sales at DD (and most tech companies) is not a perfect fit. 

If someone is looking for a role with a heavy amount of inbound pipeline, the Account Executive seat at DD is not a perfect fit. 

If someone isn't driven to reach promotion in a competitive environment, and would like a more steady 9-5 role, the Account Executive seat at DD is not a perfect fit.

The CEO recently referred to people who work from home as ""pseudo-humans"" during an all-hands meeting.

I suspect the following to be key factors: low pay raises, limited internal promotions, RTO, and a strict fixation on KPI's/metrics coupled a growing pressure from upper management for high performers to maintain unsustainable workloads to offset those departures (while making up for the low performance of others). There are likely even more factors and explanations for this that lower level engineers are shielded from ever hearing about, save for unfounded rumors - To the above, all this has been feedback I have openly shared with my managers, and frustrations that I also have. The response I get is often one of acknowledgement of these conditions, and a promise that there are initiatives and plans in place to make improvements in the long-term. However, change rarely comes. Teams consistently operate undermanned as there does not appear to be a good process in place for capping PTO requests and development days, target metrics and KPIs are not adapted to account for the volume and complexity of different product areas a support engineer is assigned to specialize in and support, discrepancies in the amount of assigned work between high and low performing individuals in a team, only continue to grow.

Datadog,5.0,"Oct 11, 2023",Growing company with a great culture,Sales Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,It is rare to find a fast growing company that has focused so heavily on maintaining their culture. Many companies try but few succeed. Datadog is one of the few companies I have seen that has been able to do this. Management truly cares about employees and actively review employee surveys to build plans to improve any items that were noted as needing improvement. Pay is good and the tech is awesome.,Observability is a hot sector and there are days where my meetings are stacked so tight I barely get a bathroom break. Both a good and bad problem I guess.

From the top down there are deeply rooted toxic mentalities that pervade across 2nd and 1st line leaders, akin to things you'd see at a used car dealership. Most lack emotional intelligence as the only people who can be promoted are those who sold a ton, instead of those who have the ability to lead others or deep product/customer understanding (more on that in a bit). They develop their favorite reps and then collaborate with other leaders on how to ""manage reps out of the business"" that aren't meeting that same standard. - Account distribution is essentially a nuclear wasteland of accounts that have been burned through for 5 years and 8-10 reps non-stop (not hyperbole). The small minority of great accounts are given to reps who have demonstrated some success (often through lucky timing) and then it snowballs from there; the rich get richer. If you do close a deal, you have to wait until the second month bill is paid, which typically takes 3 months from closed won - good luck forecasting your bills. - Unachievable quotas (ARR matching some Mid-Market and Enterprise roles at other SaaS companies) and the distribution problems in my previous point lead to around 5-9% of reps hitting their attainment for the year - quite a marked difference from the 40-50% communicated in interviews. Lead-gen and SDR influence are like the icing on the cake, except your manager decided that only one of your teammates gets the cake, and that you also have split the icing with everyone else on the team. - The culture is *Grind* There are 3 days required in office each week, 8:00ish to 5:30ish on those days, with no exception. PTO is unlimited, but if you try to take too much or schedule a personal appointment on an in-office day, your manager almost assuredly will be talking poorly about you behind your back. If you like the feeling of constantly looking over your shoulder - even when you're working hard - then this job is for YOU! - Professional growth is non-existent. They would rather churn out a wake of young sales professionals to meet their margins than actively support and develop the people who could make a lasting impact. If you lack emotional intelligence and are content to be used as a club by leadership to beat customers into submission, you might have a long and storied career in this vertical. If not, your days are likely numbered. - Most importantly, they lie. They lie about attainment, leads, career progression, and commission. They weasel their way with a tight corporate legal and HR team and find ways to wring you dry, mind, body, and soul - all while you make almost no money beyond their below-market base pay. You are even lower in their eyes than just a number, you are cannon fodder to be blasted at potential ""customers"" who just want to be left alone after years of constant harassment."

Favoritism is an understatement here. It is the classic ""Best sellers make the best leaders"" (They don't) and if you do not fit the mold of your manager, you will be shunned like an ugly duckling. Leadership is the main problem here. With a massive ""selling bro"" as the director, anyone who was not in a frat, didn't play lacrosse or doesn't enjoy drinking with their coworkers till 4 AM on a Wednesday will be looked at as a ""loser"". Middle management tries to provide an open door policy, but slip up and say anything negative and you can expect to be forced to quit via an unachievable PIP or fired on the spot. When in the interviewing process, ask the managers how many people have been on and off their team over the past calendar year. Ask how many reps an account goes through before being closed out. Ask the director how they train/empower their leaders. Ask how many reps have quit the job without any other jobs lined up (The number is staggering)."
Datadog,1.0,"Oct 26, 2023",Truly the worst SaaS Sales Org,Commercial Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,Can’t think of any other than the snacks and free lunches that were offered as an office “perk”. And the friendly kitchen staff (although they aren't Datadog employees). Health benefits are decent.,"TOXIC work environment. It’s full of cliques. The focus is on more of a social aspect and a popularity contest vibe than to actually be successful, and managers are the ring leaders of this childish behavior. AEs and SDRs are so far from hitting quota quarter over quarter, with less than 5% reaching quota while I was there. I’ve heard that only 3 AEs in the Denver office (out of 75~ AEs) hit quota in Q3 of 2023. You’ll be assigned 80 accounts and are encouraged that you’ll find a way to break into the accounts but they’re incredibly dry accounts with no interest in even having a conversation, plus you are now the 5th or 6th AE to reach out to them. In order to get a decent account in your name, you have to be one of the “popular” AEs who hangs out with management outside of work. You’re forced to go into the office 3-4 days a week, having to pay for parking each day. When you’re in the office the environment is toxic, dull, filled with negative energy, management won’t even talk to you or your team when passing in the office - literally they act like you don't exist. Promotions are very far and few between - the top rep in Denver is at his yearly quota, and was told he would qualify in July, and now as we approach November still has not been promoted. Turnover is very high, and new hires are noticing this within their 2nd month. Prior to leaving, other AEs were talking about leaving and have left and since leaving several AEs have reached out to me asking if the grass really is greener outside of the Datadog office walls, to which I can confidently say it is. There are “quarterly sales reviews” where management travels into Denver, all AEs and Managers are scheduled to sit in the cafeteria together while people get picked and told the day of to present their previous quarter sales metrics in front of 100+ people. Giving people constant anxiety for the entire day that they’re going to get called on to present. They then get grilled in front of 100+ people. It has been described as “hazing” throughout the Denver office’s sales team. Not only is this day unproductive, but embarrassing for all parties involved - especially senior managers and directors whose narcissism and ego lead them to have to comment on each and every line of a reps QSR. Don’t get sucked into drinking the Datadog kool-aid. You’ll make a very minimum base salary to be a glorified SDR with an AE title, with making commission during your first quarter of ramp and then after that you’ll make minimal commission because quota is not attainable. You’ll either be in a popular clique where the day to day might be “okay” where you don’t mind coming into the office from a social aspect or you’ll be on the outside of the cliques and counting down the hours until you can leave the office at 5:30 PM (at the earliest). If you’re interested in a “company culture” that forces happy hours and gives you free snacks, give this place a shot. If you’re interested in a “company culture” where management cares about their employees, quota is attainable, you’re seeing yourself develop and grow professionally, you have the ability to control your book of business and make money, then Datadog is not for you. Stay away."

In stead of promoting tenured people, they hire new people with significant higher salaries and cap the raise ( which is minimal). Salaries for the support role is lower than industry standards too and yet they are very cut-throat about performances and metrics. There's little internal mobility although they promise it. Once you get here it's stuck. With the technical support roles, they don't take measures to set customer experiences despite promising it for a very long time.

Although there are a few positive aspects to mention above, these pale in comparison to the negatives. If you're considering a role at a supposedly ""stable"" tech company, I strongly advise you to read the negative reviews closely to understand what you're getting yourself into. During the interview process, they might claim that 30-40% of reps hit quota, but this is far from the truth. In reality, only about 5-7% (and that's being generous) of sales reps consistently hit their quotas, and many of them rely on opportunities closed in the past to achieve this. - When you're grinding from 7 am to 6 pm and hitting quota, your managers and leadership will love you. However, if you're working those same hours but falling short, you'll notice a significant change in the way you're treated from top to bottom. The VP of Sales will give locker room pump up speeches about how, “you can do big things here and make a ton of money”. While that happens for a few individuals every quarter, 97% of reps struggle day in and day out. - When sales reps regularly make jokes about suicide in the office, that usually means there's a bigger problem within the org as a whole. (Don’t try to justify this and say this happens everywhere, it really doesn’t.) - If you have a doctor's appointment or car troubles one of the three days you’re supposed to be in the office, expect to hear about it from your manager. That’s just not okay apparently. - When a high performing AE leaves the company, people talk about it for a day or so and then it’s old news. The next ""hungry"" sales rep steps in, eager to prove themselves until they too eventually burn out. It's an ongoing cycle that repeats itself time and time again. - Unfortunately, it's unlikely that anything will change within Datadog's commercial sales org. From a revenue perspective, it works. They are willing to sacrifice their employees mental wellbeing in order to please investors long term."

During the post-pandemic period, a significant influx of managers, ranging from EM1 to VP levels, joined the company. It's become apparent that each of these managers is primarily driven by their career advancement ambitions. They chose to join Datadog and brought in numerous new hires, seemingly as a means to bolster their own standing within the company. Engineers, for the most part, tolerated this situation as it didn't directly impact their day-to-day work. However, with the recent decline in the market, the C-suite has started to scrutinize these empire-building endeavors, seeking concrete evidence of their achievements. Moreover, they've reduced the available headcount for these managers, which has prompted them to set unrealistic deadlines and closely scrutinize their own engineering teams. Consequently, we've witnessed a wave of engineer layoffs, and those who remain are under immense pressure to produce results, even though the managers seem uncertain about the specific goals they want to achieve. It appears that these managers are primarily concerned with protecting their own positions, even if it means sacrificing the well-being of our services, team morale, and the actual work being done. Regrettably, the atmosphere within the company, especially within the NYC office, has become quite hostile due to management's insistence on framing every engineer's existence as a zero-sum game. To pave the way for a more promising future, it's imperative that management undergoes a restructuring process that emphasizes technical expertise. We can only hope that this review reaches the ears of Datadog's HR department and is subsequently brought to the attention of Olivier and Alq, so they can take corrective action with regards to our current management team. Datadog should consider a reevaluation of its leadership, similar to the approach taken by Meta, in order to rid the company of empire builders who are now resorting to engineer layoffs."

The sales culture here is very lively and collaborative where it is very easy to learn from your peers who are seeing success. I came in to this role from being an SDR at another tech company and Datadog has given me the skills to really thrive in a sales career at any company. The benefits are also top notch with full health coverage and $1200 for a fitness reimbursement.,This is a full sales cycle role where you will be making a lot of cold calls and emails on a daily basis. This isn't for everyone and as they hire a lot of people from SDR type roles you can see some high turnover. If you are up for the challenge you will succeed and make a lot of money.

Salary is great. They try VERY hard to be seen as a good company to work at.,"This is just my situation. But it is a doozy. I was contacted by one of their recruiters, looking to hire for the position since the person who had that position got promoted. Interview was fine, expect for one Sr level person who the recruiter warned me was an odd person. Little did I know how odd. I got the position, and took the job. The immediate team and manager were fantastic, but there was some cult-ish and strange sense that I could not shake. Almost 2 years into the position, it became very clear just how thin skinned the Sr level manager really was. If management even gets a hint of a worker who has a mind of their own, be prepared for surveillance. I was contacted by a Sr person in the HR (people ops! Naturally!) dept telling me to take my TikTok account down because it seemed like I was speaking negatively of the company. Meanwhile, the Sr person who had just become my manager recently was actively looking at ways to get rid of me. Eventually it came to a place where there was just no way to be at the company and maintain my sanity. But it is amazing the lengths at which HR will go to bat for bad leadership and make excuses. I heard from other employees during my tenure how bad things could be, and I am sad to learn that no one exaggerated just how bad things can be. The CEO and his co founder are pretty aloof for all their talk of how much they consider themselves part of the team. Which is fine, they’re both worth multiple billions. But they’re pretense that they are just like us - that’s not an honest picture. For all their talk of being a very modern company, sadly Datadog is just as “corporate” as 100+ year companies."

Regrettably, the transformation it has undergone is deeply disappointing. The toxic atmosphere that descended after a series of layoffs is palpable.

We were inundated with demands for more projects and initiatives, most of which proved utterly meaningless and were promptly forgotten once delivered. The disheartening reality is that individuals here are primarily focused on justifying their salaries and falsely claiming credit for work they didn't genuinely contribute to.

Performance evaluations underwent frequent and arbitrary changes to align with management's preferences. Promotions and raises were inexplicably granted to those who excelled at flattery rather than demonstrating competent job performance. What's even more disheartening is that bringing up concerns about underperforming colleagues with your manager proved futile, as they simply brushed it aside.

Even if you consistently met all your deliverables, a lack of visibility would swiftly result in being placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PiP). This place has devolved into a hire-and-fire institution, where even individuals who relocated with their families found themselves out of a job within weeks.

Despite its aspirations to match the prestige of FAANG companies, the stark reality is that the compensation here doesn't even come close. They incessantly adopt detrimental practices from other companies while discarding existing, effective ones.

My advice to the management is simple: heed the voices of your employees. Until that crucial change takes place, I genuinely cannot, in good conscience, recommend Delivery Hero. I strongly advise steering clear of it."

The more junior you are, the less you need to deal with the very questionable moral of our senior leadership.
Work life balance is fine, but this is due to the fact that we overhired and lately there was not that much work, after the latest layoff, things will probably change.",Multiple rounds of layoffs were executed over the past year and a lot of people were dismissed not fully legally. Employees who do not know their rights have been brainwashed to think that it is totally fine to be laid off due to poor performance (not fired the legal way but laid off).

During my all probation period I have receiving very positive feedbacks like “great job”, “I’m happy that you are in my team”, “perfect, perfect, perfect” etc. In addition my team performed great that was confirmed by staff manager. I had a great connection with my team, all members valued me. All seemed to be good. That’s what I thought until the last week of my probation.
On the last week of my probation my manager + 2 HRs informed me that my probation was not successful and DH will not continue working relationships with me. My manager said that I was too in tech though she expected from me more dive in business. I was shocked, my team was working on API integration solutions. How comes PM of the team to be more in business then in tech? What about our agreements? It was so inconsistent, untrustworthy and misleading. I can accept that expectations might have changed, but this ALWAYS MUST be communicated in timely manner but not on the last working day! I consider it as unfair and harmful for all parties: me, my team, DH. Absolutely wired experience. Maybe there were other reason (mass layoffs recently, so if it was costs optimisation everyone who is on probation are at highest risk), but the one that was declared seems to be a nonsense."

As for compensation, it's not exactly stellar. The pay is lackluster, considering the tumultuous environment and the expectation of dedication. The office dynamics are far from welcoming, with an overall vibe that lacks cohesion and friendliness among colleagues.

Murex,3.0,"Dec 30, 2013","Tough as steel, unstructured and political environment - Not for the faint of heart!",Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,,"Good experience right out of school and after in financial services

Broad range of clients - can sample the full spectrum of financial services, asset managers, hedge funds, investment banks, regional banks, insurance companies - you name it

With the right team and right client(s), one can great exposure across the entire spectrum of trading business especially on the front office consulting side.

Very capable people with some that are truly extra-ordinary

Decent pay","Very specialized software has its downside. Stay long here and you will find it hard to exit to a career in banking or hedge funds which is what most people here aspire to as a next step in their career. 

Ideal exit point, should you choose to do that, is near the 3-4 year mark. This has more to do with the recruiting in the banking/hedge fund industry that cannot benchmark a role at Murex. 

Average person at Murex is likely to have had broader exposure than an average person at a bank in a given period of time. However this is not widely recognized. People have made later exits into banking or hedge funds but not without taking a role at least initially that is lower in stature than their roles and responsibilities at Murex.

There is a risk of being pigeon-holed. Despite the fact that different people do different things at Murex, to the outside world everyone is a Murex consultant.

Very Paris-centered and especially so for top level roles. This is a big downer for talented people at satellite offices.

Have to watch your back, especially with mid level managers that are very insecure. Be prepared to be stabbed in the back without any warning!

Management at all levels needs work on the behavioral side - starting with how to treat people with respect."

- Free drink and fruits in the kitchen;
- Good benefits (insurance coverage, pension plan, etc.)","- Work environment seems casual, but people can be excessively nervous and sensitive whenever they hear something negative;
- Too much micromanagement and instruction, little liberty to manage your own daily job;
- Not a good career choice for the math/stats/finance major. The only possible career path is IT support or engineer (not even developer);
- Strong focus on vanity projects to win over clients instead of product improvement, innovation and internal process streamlining;
- Senior people seem nice, but are actually hypocritical and deduct employees' bonus and raise whenever they have the chance."

3. Murex tolerates remote work (up to 2 days per week) but does not encourage it. Management and work culture make it clear that it's not appreciated.

He can always find something to criticize you because he is happy about that. 2. The Management: there is no clear plan even though we have many useless planning meetings, you have no way to choose what you do and how you do it. 3. The Administrative Manager: he will only give you pressure and push you to do more and more. 4. The Project: Ten million lines of legacy code (created 10 or 15 years ago), thousands of shit tests which may take years to finish ! You have to enjoy your deadline. 5. The Task: Hundreds of fixes waiting for you every day, there is no way to create something or learn something new, your work is to fix old projects. No way ! 6.

However, for those whose sales performance falls in the mediocre range, the absence of tangible benefits is accompanied by recurring coaching sessions aimed at improvement with a threat of being fired if you don't.","Their sole focus is on sales, neglecting the provision of exceptional technical support. The true essence of teamwork eludes them, despite their claims of fostering collaboration among teams. Instead of promoting unity, they create an environment where individuals are pitted against each other. Actions are taken not out of genuine necessity but rather to impart lessons.

Until they manually reduce your metrics so you aren't paid as much. Insurance seems good for a group plan.,"Asurion Middle and Upper management is absolutely clueless. They do not care anything about the customers and just want you to pitch Home Tech Protection until the customer either buys or dies. Shady sales approach. Reps continually lie just to get a sale, with no reprimand by management. Unrealistic sales goals if you have even a shred of integrity. A revolving door of reps who do not have a clue what they are doing and coaches who do not care if they mess up customer's claims as long as they sell the protection. This organization should be ashamed of themselves. What a joke. Is in no way shape or form a sales job. As sleazy as it gets! Do not do it!"

Customers say no once, twice, three times before we can stop our pitch. Our coaches listen to our calls and rate them. They pick them apart with a fine tooth comb and yes they will say great job doing this or you did that perfectly, but they will also ask why you didn't get the sale and why you didn't ask them a fourth time etc. We were basically suppose to badger the customer until they give in and say yes. We were told it was no longer a customer service position, that it was now a SALES position. If you don't make your sales goal for a month, you get a warning. The next time a written warning and then you get terminated. When I was first hired you got to pick your own schedule, right down to when your breaks were. Now you have to bid on shifts and if your sales aren't meeting goal, you won't get anything close to what you need for a schedule."

-Does not care at ALL for employees. Constant understaffing, cannot retain employees, raises are next to nothing, promotions often denied to women who also make less money than male coworkers
-Sketchy hiring policies. Bait and switch upon hiring, will offer you a job and then say ""oh by the way we changed the role"" after you already signed contracts. They also offered me a higher pay on the phone, confirmed with me on the phone, and then my offer letter had a lesser amount.
-Poor training. Expects coworkers to teach new hires.
-Sketchy firing practices. Employees who make them the most money in sales are HIGHLY prioritized and favored, even to the point of letting them get away with multiple infractions other people were fired for.
-Impossible workload. Massively stressful. Often sends employees to other stores to cover and is forced to host ""repair parties"" where employees work OT until midnight to get workload down.
-Management takes frequent PTO and gets flown to Florida multiple times a year to get drunk and take time off while their employees don't even get sick pay.
-People quit without even finishing training. Often.
-NO SICK PAY."

Results driven - Asurion values its people and the results they bring. If you treat others with respect and produce results, you will have a great career here. Fast - Asurion is a massive company with a lot of people, but it doesn't take long for great decisions to get action within your team or partner teams. Everyone is running in the same direction and accept great ideas no matter where they come from. There's even a place for ANY employee to suggest ideas and process improvements to the C suite. People - There's a theme here with people. From the interview process to the onboarding process to the continuing education inside the building - this is a company that really, really cares. People are recognized and celebrated for their successes. It helps develop a culture of the behaviors we celebrate so employees can model. Amenities - The corporate HQ is gorgeous and modern.

The commissions are pitiful, at most $25/sale and their rules about trying to record people in their own homes make customers very uncomfortable and distrustful, and since you aren't allowed to contact customers after the deliveries you're given no opportunity to save a cancellation, but the company still counts them against you. I was #1 salesman in the region for 3 months, even met the ceo and had a photo op, but because my numbers were good they gave me more stops on my route, which I appreciated, however, since I was then seeing 2x the customers as my fellow teammates, my numbers skyrocketed despite the percentages remaining reasonable albeit ahead. I have prior sales experiences which was why I was successful to begin with. Then, witb no warning whatsoever, I was placed on unpaid administrative leave while the company investigated my sales tactics, I wasn't asked to give any statements or elaborations and after the ""administrative leave"" the company completely ghosted me. I never got any resolution whatsoever. This job is, in my opinion, extremely volatile and I strongly recommend against working here as you can be terminated either for not making enough sales, or apparently, making too many."

Upper management is miserable, if you don’t get at LEAST one homeplus a day you have to have an “adapt” where they basically smack you in the wrist and say to get a sale, but yet when you ask for help to strengthen sales you get met with “well did you offer?”. Mind you, when I was being onboarded by my recruiter sales were made out to be OPTIONAL and never did she communicate that sales are the ONLY metric they care about. Just to make things better, we don’t have actual “sick time off” and in order to accrue ONE DAY of PTO you have to work 1 month straight (you earn 2 hrs of pto per pay check).

Return to Office - for a company that prides itself on being transparent and honest, whose nominal credo starts with ""First and foremost, we do the right thing"" they lied their ***** off about their motivations for RTO. ""We, a data-driven, numbers-based company want to impose the cataclysmic costs of commuting of up to 3 hours daily on our employees with no compensation to reap all the tax benefits which the company will retain."" All the costs on us, none of the benefits. So we can have more ""collaboration."" Like I can collaborate better in the Seattle office with colleagues in Hyderabad than I could from home. Bullpucky. No, they are getting tax breaks for occupancy and don't care how much damage they inflict to get it. The CEO can make a case. That he failed to do so tells me there is no case to make. At least, none that would be acceptable over ""because I said so."" The FAQ on RTO they published reads like an essay by a student who didn't read the assignment. ""How about the climate impact of all those extra trips?"" ""We are very concerned about climate change. (EOM)"" Not concerned enough to not impose all those miles of commuting on some of the most congested roads in the U.S. So anyway, I have no trust.

The soul of the company and the pros that we had were mostly removed in the past few years. Recent pro, wellness weekends as a few extra PTO days.","Employee engagement programs were all but shut down. People who worked across departments were all let go. Internal Promotions were almost non-existent. External hiring added management at all levels who would show up, announce a major change to boost their name and then leave. Compensation did not even try to keep up with the market. 2 years with no raises due to pandemic uncertainty, followed by a ""raise"" and a cut in RSUs that landed in a wash despite huge cost of living increases at the same time. RTO demands while over 3/4 of employees did not see value in returning. Distributed teams not properly managed by inflexible managers. Unreasonable hours and regular weekend work because no-one felt they could actually log off for a break. I was here for over 5 years, and there was only 1 year we did not have either a major re-org or large layoffs. Layoffs often selected employees who were not redundant forcing others to pick up the slack and learn new skills rapidly. This resulted of course in spreading resources to thin, diminishing meeting SLAs on both systems, and then the employees picking up the slack being judged for not meeting what multiple people were doing before. After years of this, the weight of 5 or more resources were being carried by individual burnt out people who had no hope for improvement or any chance at success. The company has not been releasing products internally instead acquiring other companies to bolster their product lines temporarily while showing no faith in existing engineering teams. Senior leadership would not support the suggestions that were needed to resolve issues, especially with acquired companies. D&I was a meaningful program focused on policy, benefits, and was supposed to offer a path to leadership skills and promotions. Now it is just words. The real programs no longer offer hope to employees and are used for marketing to investors and colleges."

I was told the other day in a meeting, that it could be another 4 quarters before they look at raises again. This would be a 3 year stagnant period without a raise in the highest inflation times in several decades. I know the company is still making money, just not as much as they want to make. However 433 million USD is not loosing money. This is the first company I have ever worked for in the last 40 years that I have not been given an annual raise of at least something. Some were not good if it was a bad year, but at least it was something."

They never came close to withholding 50% and it was never a consistent amount. They couldn't explain to me why or how they calculated the amount that was withheld. There had not been merit increases for the 7 years before I joined. There was a merit increase announced but since I had only been employed for 11 months and 3 weeks, instead of 12 months, I was ineligible. I found out over 2 years after I quit that they never updated my employment status with the 401k administrator so I cannot do a rollover. I contacted them with no response. I followed up and was told they would submit the update - not completed after 10 days. Again, I followed up to be told the request was made with offshore. Still waiting but will likely need to resort to taking legal action. Everything is run by the offshore parent company that has no understanding of how a company is run.

- They hire you and sorta modify you resume which helps you get in. It sounds immoral, but when companies reject you for ""junior/entry level roles"" that are barred by 5 years of experience, you gotta game the system somehow

- They'll almost always find a job. I went through a training program for their 1st job and I got paid even when on the bench. If there's an issue HR/IT support is very responsive so that's nice ( be warned, for some reason their forgot password can't recognize non- Indian numbers, which is a pain)","There is literally 0 upward mobility. After a year of working with them and satisfactory response from the client, their total raise was capped at 5%, which doesn't even help beat inflation standards. 

In addition, they have an absurd list of monthly pop quizzes/random crap to do. And believe it or not, its not TCS levels of ""Can you cosplay a human dictionary and cram all these terms"" but its still a pain. I'll never understand why companies think employees have to spend literal days doing their pop quizzes on HR things

Like EVERY service based company, you'll ALWAYS make less through them than directly working with a company. And its just common sense since these companies need a way to survive"

No innovation - there's no product vision or direction, just meaningless buzzwords to provide the illusion of progress while the executives plunder.

Constant pivots and re-orgs. No product vision or plan = musical chairs.

HR is almost completed automated (oh the irony) so if you have a problem, good luck.

Shrinking benefits in order to pay for grotesque executive salaries.

Racist (and generally awful) behavior from IronSource towards Muslim employees that is tolerated by management.

Employees used to be able to voice their objections and opinions but that was quickly stomped.

Constantly tanking stock value: RSUs are worthless

Completely disorganized and disjointed information management; everything has to be found in one of the thousands of Slack channels.

Constantly changing tools - over 30 internal tools, most of which are in a constant state of sunset or introduction

No annual review system or way to track metrics, progress, or goals. Management doesn't set KPIs or OKRs because everyone is always being re-org'd and priorities are always shifting.

-Exceptionally poor management. Expect to be gaslit and ridiculed by your managers. Your voice doesn't even matter. Everything that was once Unity (grow side) is now ran by Iron Source and they have 0 empathy for employees.

-Poor culture. Just ask the employees that are still there how things were before Iron Source took over. It's night and day.

-Upper management doesn't even have a grasp on how the Unity product works and nobody is ever aligned with product functionalities and launches. Miscommunication across the board. 

-They keep trying to run Unity like Iron Source and apply strategies that make no sense.

-Management asks you to challenge them and when you do and they don't like your idea, you'll get skewered. They don't even want to bother with what you said. 

-Even though the interim CEO rescinded RTO, the management on the Grow side is forcing employees to come in 3x a week still. 

-During a meeting about culture, a manager literally said that since there have been so many layoffs, you now have space to come in and work wherever you want. 

- Clicky culture and a lot of 'yes man' mentality here. A lot of ego issues here.

-Unity has laid off over 2K+ people since 2022."

Sending big impact news via emails instead of having a meeting with the employees. Executives encouraging everyone to RTO, but they are not actually showing up to the office"

In general all my colleagues have been very motivated and engaged and generally want the best for the product and the company.","Layoffs after layoffs in the last six months I’ve been here. Inconsistent as well, some layoffs have rehoming which means they were well thought out, but some didn’t. Inefficient decisions: I know of at least one position removed due to redundancy and then rehired. Internally there’s no real processes so efficiency was low."

Unity,1.0,"May 4, 2023",Run the other way - you can do better elsewhere,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,Beautiful offices. Really good mental health benefits.,"Antiquated out of touch thinking from Leadership. C Suite has run this company into the ground worshipping on the altar of quarterly earnings. Third round of layoffs in a year with no impact on the bottom line. Layoffs were automated through emails. If an affected employee wanted to talk with a human being, they have to fill out a request form. Severance was pitiful from what I’ve been told. The “values” are a joke particularly the oft cited “in it together” which should be reframed to “in it for myself”. Benefits are cut, RTO is being forced starting September, offices closed."
Unity,1.0,"Jun 12, 2023",Going public sent company down a different path.,Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,"San Francisco, CA",Some of the employees and engineers are amazing. Some of the incredible talent that made Unity what it is are still there.,"As a long long time Unity user, nearly since version 1 of Unity, I was super excited to work at Unity. Unity always stood out as a company for the indie devs, your ally, your partner, to help you get past all the barriers in the industry that small players face. But I think ever since it went public it has gradually eroded into a pure profit growth driven business. Leadership cares about nothing more than what will get stock to go up in the short term. They've hired so many people from other Big Tech Corporations trying to essentially colonize original Unity culture with Big Tech Corporate process and culture, and they are winning. Many Unity originals, Engineers that have been there since the beginning have left. They pushed out Joachim, the original CTO, the last Unity original and real engineer on C-Suite, so literally Unity leadership has been entirely usurped by non-engineer business types. The only places still managing to do anything good are those places with very high level engineers that still have substantial political weight to throw around and happen to be in a stream that can be argued to make the stock price to go up short term. But increasingly they must fight against pure business side that greatly outnumbers them with free time to play the bureaucracy game. If the narrative about their effort affecting stop price changes, they will be rug-pulled fast. Being an engineer that can do anything of value is like sitting in a middle of a circus. They are cycling through managers and product people just trying to find anyway to milk any more cash from anything in the short term. They have even in the past year started to cannibalize some of their own customers. Unity isn't even a good company to partner with anymore, the relationship will be predatory and extorting, tuned for short term stock inflation however possible. It's a sad thing but I think its just the fate of any successful tech company. The engineers build something of value. Gradually the company hires more and more business people until they overtake the company, then a company once driven by engineers and engineering innovation is now driven by excel spreadsheets trying to get the stock price to go up however it possibly can to let the current round of business people to get a decent cash out on their stock options before jumping companies again every 3-ish years or so. Even worse, in recent months in response to sweeping corporate policy changes, they've actually taken to firing people on the spot who disagree with leadership. A few of these got out in the news, but there have been dozens of them. They were not all justified. Internal slack and communication has become much more shut down compared to what used to be a very open and communicative company. Increasingly it is only ""Yes Men"" saying anything out in the open. The business crowd that's usurped all controls of the company are playing a hard ball game of thrones with power. A bunch of engineering illiterate suits super super paranoid that people will figure out what they are and call them out on it are now sitting at the top terrified, trying to milk whatever nonsense they can for another stock payout or bit of nonsensical media attention."

Some managers are really good about it, while others... not so much.","- The company's leadership team has demonstrated consistently poor communication skills, resulting in a lack of direction and confusion among employees. - Benefits have been frequently removed, making it difficult for employees to rely on them. - Employees have even experienced pay decreases in the form of lost monetary benefits and pushed back promotion cycles - The culture promoted by Unity's leadership feels disingenuous and is only prioritized when it aligns with their agenda. - Unity lacks a clear company direction and has shown a lack of focus, jumping from one thing to another. - High-level management has been ineffective and detrimental (calling people f**** idiots) in engaging with the public and making decisions in good faith. - Team siloing is a persistent issue, creating a lack of collaboration and communication among departments. - Instead of dealing with the issues causing siloing and duplication of work, leadership just cuts the duplicates and continues to let the reason why the problem happened unaddressed. - The company has undergone constant restructuring, which damages productivity and established relationships among employees. - Unity has laid off individuals with years of experience, resulting in a loss of deeply knowledgeable employees with institutional knowledge. - Unity has shown a persistent dismissal of valid concerns and a tone-deaf approach to messaging. - Unity consistently prioritizes punishing people for how they criticize things. Instead of being concerned that frustration has reached a boiling point, they are easily distracted and emotional with how things are conveyed. They fixate on how a message is delivered and don't focus on the content of the message. - They frequently operate around feelings and emotional trends, and not data. - With trends company has a demonstrated history of chasing trends, for example, the metaverse and now AI"

- The process for receiving raises and promotions appears to be slower compared to industry standards, causing frustration among employees.
- The current compensation is on the lower side when benchmarked against competitors, potentially impacting employee satisfaction and retention.
- Overtime pay is not granted unless upper management approves, which may affect employees' morale who contribute additional hours to meet project demands.

These changes can bring uncertainty and potential shifts in roles, responsibilities, or reporting lines, requiring adaptability and flexibility from employees. Limited Remote Work Opportunities: Teradata's work may involve close collaboration with clients or on-site project work, which may limit the availability of remote work options. Depending on the specific role and project requirements, remote work flexibility may be limited. Competitive Industry: The data and analytics industry is highly competitive, and staying ahead of the curve requires continuous learning and professional development. This competitive landscape may necessitate a proactive approach to skill-building and staying updated with the latest industry trends."

Teradata,1.0,"May 30, 2023",It is a slowly sinking ship,Staff Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Bellevue, WA","It still has a few years left to go down. Join this company if you're really out of options. Don't get too comfortable - plan to exit as soon as you get the opportunity. The benefits here are average and pretty standard - medical, dental, vision, life insurance, ad&d insurance. Obviously the premiums are coming out of your paycheck.","They have layoffs every year without fail. On the flip side, they don't really do anything innovative here. They have a parallel processing database that was very successful for decades before the cloud - they have name recognition in the enterprise. They have mediocre cloud offerings now. The real problem is that they don't have enough smart people working there, and more importantly, the duds have been elevated to high positions. Eventually, they let go of their CEO every few years, because this place has been a cesspool of bad people and bad ideas. They willfully ignore customer pain by routinely using patchwork and duct tape. The codebases reflect that. If you're a new grad that entered into this company, know that almost everything you see there is the wrong way of getting things done. The only reason customers even tolerate their offerings is either because they have legacy IBM mainframe applications that they still use, and they need to be on Teradata. You would think that technology companies make money by selling their technology. You would be wrong. This company makes money by building solutions that hard to manage and operate. They make the bulk of their money by contracting their employees on site with their enterprise customers to manage and operate their technology solutions. So much for a cloud offering. You would think that a company that is in this situation would pause and actually rethink their cloud strategy. They did, and nothing changed. Of course, they wanted everything to be done ""quickly"". They still make money by contracting people with their customers. Their main competitor is Snowflake. Imagine if you needed to hire someone to operate Snowflake. Teradata also routinely lays off these contractors. They have done it so many times at this point that I have personally met so many of these people who have successfully moved their employer away from Teradata. This company is a slowly sinking ship because no matter what the management attempts, nothing changes. Management gets frustrated, and lay off a bunch of people when things don't work. Eventually, Management failure is too visible, and they are let go. And so spins this wheel of misfortune. They stock has gone nowhere in years even before the pandemic. The upward movement in the stock is always market driven than anything to do with the company."

The technology has many advantages and has features that are often not used efficiently or that get managed away in larger organizations making the tech look brittle and inflexible. It's not - you can throw bad code at big data using the platform but a mild amount of design does go a long way. Teradata has been around for more than a minute and tends to adopt some of the newer, more innovative ideas of other vendors in a moderately measured way. ""It just works"" is a key phrase I've often heard from customers even at times when they were tightening costs on the platform.","The biggest constant is change and no company stands still. It's a good thing in aggregate but I feel like in transforming Teradata has lost some of its identity.

Management and team leads were subject matter experts and professional. Workload was steady which gave chances to learn new things. However, it didnt stay that way as management began to change and more was added to everyone's workload without additional employees. Things might have changed since I left. However, when the last year I was there it was not a healthy work environment. All of those who were subject matter experts of the department either left or changed departments. New management (specifically team leads) were not adequate. They didn't know much, thus created office hours so co-workers can help each other since they couldn't help. If they did help, it took a while for them to figure it out. Due to the pandemic and changes in processes/polices, the workload became heavier with small raises and bonuses. Instead of hiring the right number of people, they added more to your workload and if you didn't keep up with the new workload, you were now underperforming. In addition, they actually got someone fired over some bs. I was shocked that they and HR got away with how they treated her.

The new management is absolutely deaf, Pulse surveys thinned out and then disappeared specially when Layoffs happened and chaos became the norm, at times it felt like the CTO wanted to thin the headcount by destroying every process we had, and making every work day a miserable experience. Most of the great people I knew that worked there were laid off or gone, lots of rumors that the goal is and always was to offshore all the technology team which is at odds with the supposed ""local destination"" message they wanted to convey.

Well lemme think.. oh wait it's NOTHING.,"What used to be pros of the company are now cons of it. Right from the moment venture capitalists stepped in; the company is going to dogs. It's disheartening to see the current state of groupon. Earlier the company used to be a haven for the employees but now it's more like a one way trip to hell. The management fires employees without a prior intimation or notice. It's feels as if they wake up in the morning and think as to whom or which team should I fire. Doesn't matter if u are the best performer or the best performing team; you will be fired. This is not an exaggeration. People are being fired like a sport. Dusan and his team must learn proper people management. For them cost optimization is firing employees. A personal suggestion from my side to people looking to join Groupon. Please DON'T. Management now is least interested in your growth, your performance or your existence for that matter. What used to be a great company is now in the rabbit's hole. Look for some other better companies. All that these people care is money and I am not even talking about profit that you generate. Despite you being the top performer you will be be fired. And yes don't even expect an explanation from their side coz they won't. Strongly will never recommend this hell of a place to anyone.

The people here are great.","Not the company they used to be 5-10 years ago- most business owners associate it with cheapness and low margins. Pay could be better- its not very hard to hit targets but commissions haven't picked up post covid. As a result they have been doing a lot of experimenting with the product to bring back revenues. They've been automating a lot as well and scaling back on cost- hopefully they don't reduce headcount which they've been hinting at for the last six months (again they are transparent about all this which I appreciate). As a result of all the changes and innovations some things get swept under rug because Account management is bogged down.

In 2023, it is very shocking to see such lack of DEI - although they advertise it all over their company profile page, I, and many others, know this company is far from diverse, or inclusive. Another con is the long-term viability of this company on just its actual product/service alone. I know very few people who use Groupon anymore. Times have changed. Groupon should've been sold to Google years ago for billions, but it can barely make the millions now. Even fudging the numbers like they did in the past (google it) can't save this company.

The manner in which employees were laid- off in January 2023 was not compassionate in the slightest - including terminating all health insurance policies within 1 week of termination and offering a very lacking severance package.

I learnt a lot! Your colleague are passionate by their job and you’ll share lot of great conversations. You have a lot of liberty, many teams you could join if you want to switch from one subject to another.

Today, I was laid off from Criteo. In a five minute digital meeting with my boss, she informed me that my position was eliminated (“a reduction in force, decision not reflective of my performance, return your laptop in 30 days, etc.”), and then she left the meeting so that the HR Manager could provide the logistics of my unplanned departure. The end.

This is not my first time being laid off. It is, however, the first time that a lay off felt impersonal. As I was signing my digital paperwork, my boss shot over to me a message via Slack, saying, “So sorry. Best of luck!” No messages from the leaders or the team. Four individual colleagues reached out to share their sadness, appreciation and best wishes before my systems access was shut off. That’s all. I truly feel like a number who was erased. What happened to the relationships that I had established? Did I mean nothing to them? Any appreciation? Did I achieve anything? It feels like a year of my life wasted. 

If this is the Future of Work, I don’t want it."

When I learned what the OTE was, I explained that # is what I was looking for my base alone.... Which is fine! There was a disconnect and it's better to get these things out early in the interview process rather than later. The recruiters response was "" well good luck with that. I don't see that anywhere out there at all"". Continued to be smug about what I said. Apparently this person knows all of the media advertising space! What an absolute pleasure to speak on the phone with someone so knowledgeable and professional. Next time, just say ""At that price point, I'd suggest to keep your eye open for a more senior role here"". What an embarrassment.

The commitment to serving our community responsibly demonstrates the company's genuine desire to make a positive impact beyond the workplace.

In conclusion, I think OKX is more than just a place to work, it's a community that values its employees, promotes diversity, and actively contributes to the betterment of society. I am proud to be part of such a forward-thinking and socially responsible organization.","While the company's dynamic nature keeps us on our toes, the rapid pace of change can sometimes be challenging to navigate. The fast-paced environment requires adaptability and often necessitates OT to keep up with the evolving demands. While the commitment to innovation is commendable, finding a balance between staying agile and maintaining a healthy work-life equilibrium can be a hurdle at times. It's important for employees to be prepared for the occasional need for extra hours to meet tight deadlines or address sudden shifts in priorities."

It's refreshing to know that your contributions are valued, no matter where you are on the corporate ladder. Innovative Environment: OKX fosters an innovative environment where employees are encouraged to suggest and drive new features. This creative freedom allows us to contribute to the company's growth actively. Also founder comes from a engineering background - provides a great insight to products. Recognition from Management: I appreciate how our management team consistently acknowledges and credits employees for their hard work. It creates a motivating atmosphere where dedication is truly appreciated. Competitive Compensation: OKX offers competitive compensation packages, $20 foodpanda lunch + $25 foodpanda dinner every weekday + Monthly teambonding funds + Gym funds + Learning Funds Global Expansion and Language Support: It's exciting to see OKX expanding globally. They invest a lot in fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce, with a strong emphasis on improving English proficiency. This effort truly supports professional growth on a global scale. Also there are quite a number of opportunities to travel overseas to learn from fellow overseas colleagues.","Fast-Paced Industry: The web3 industry is known for its rapid changes, which means our directions can shift quickly. Adapting to this fast-paced environment is crucial, and newcomers should be prepared for such changes. Occasional Longer Work Hours: Some days may require you to work a bit later, especially when certain features demand extra attention. However, this is a common occurrence in the tech world. Global Collaboration: Working with global teams is rewarding, but it may sometimes necessitate adjusting your working hours to align with the schedules of colleagues in different time zones. Flexibility is key in such situations. Languages: In some teams, there might be a need to learn Chinese to facilitate effective communication. However, it's worth noting that many individuals from non-Chinese backgrounds have still been able to collaborate effectively. While language requirements can be a challenge, the company strives to create an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute, regardless of their language skills."

Splunk,5.0,"Feb 23, 2024",Great,Regional Sales Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Plano, TX",Best job I’ve ever had,Territories can be tough for some. If you have a good territory you’re set.
Splunk,2.0,"Dec 21, 2023",Coasting until the acquisition,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,Splunk has amazing benefits. The best health plans and perks I have ever encountered in my career. A handful of good eggs across several orgs make it bearable. Decent work life balance but the writing is on the wall as layoffs continue and the survivors are left having to do several jobs instead of one.,"Where do I begin? This is not a place for careee growth, it’s where you can get by and coast until retirement (the average age at this org is up there). If you are part of the inner circle, you are set for life. No amount of trying to fix the limitless red tape and poor process will get you anywhere. It is impossible to do your job with slow or broken tools. People who have never done your job are in charge of how it gets done. Why? I have spent two years here and no one can tell me how to get promoted. I have had four bosses in the same time and same BS. 

The inclusion delusion here is wild. Splunk likes to go on and on about its inclusivity yet you sit on call after call where you’re the only woman, only POC, or both. 

They cut 7% of jobs and then celebrate a “successful quarter”. 

The only way to stay sane here is to find stuff outside of work that makes the groundhog’s day of a job here worth it. For your manager it’s buying a boat or something."
Splunk,2.0,"Feb 3, 2024",It’s becoming a joke,Regional Sales Manager,Current Employee,,Work life balance and benefits,"No career growth at all. They will promote who they want, no matter how good or bad they are at their job.

Leadership rarely knows how to run a sales cycle. They just get on a call and say give me the p.o but don’t know how to do any of the background jobs 

Everyone is leaving after this Cisco acquisition. People are going to make so much money on the stock so they are coasting.

Product is getting passed up and the company doesn’t want to admit it.

If you want to work here, make sure you’re at a majors or enterprise account or higher. Leadership started this commercial growth segment and not 1 person hit quota in America. Average quota attainment was probably around 25-30% for reps but the directors were around 60-80%. Bigger account reps dominated."
Splunk,3.0,"Feb 9, 2024",Not the Splunk it used to be,Regional Sales Manager,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"Pay, Benefits, unlimited PTO, very nice and smart co workers",I have never seen so much great and intelligent talent to leave the company. Commercial Growth segment was a joke. No one hit the quota and they laid them all off. They also wanted RSMs to sell through partners which only complicated the process even more since not all of the partners even know what Splunk does. Competition is bitting them for sure. They are trying to sell premium product to small and medium businesses and they failed miserably. Upper leadership doesn't know what they are doing ( they don't even know how to sell the solution). Since Garry joined the company the culture is getting worse and worse.
Splunk,1.0,"Feb 22, 2024",Much worse than a year ago and very toxic now,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,You can do your own thing at all times and tee up a ton of stuff.,No vision. New executive leadership is inexperienced and faking it while they destroy everything they touch. Nothing ever gets shipped and everything is now top down. If you ask clarifying questions or idea share you will be pulled aside and called insubordinate. Team meetings now consist of exec talking about how smart they are and everyone else is around just to be seen so they keep their job. Its every man for themselves now with 0 career growth opportunities. Best way to describe it is - toxic and on the verge of becoming a career killing organization.
Splunk,3.0,"Feb 21, 2024",They treat you like you're still in college,Business Development Representative (BDR),"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Dallas, TX","-Easy to meet quota when I worked there
-Collaborative environment 
-Fun culture (at times)","The dynamic is so similar to that of being in college. Leadership will require you to complete homework like assignments and congratulate those that kiss a** rather than those that consistently meet quota. Extra points if you create a slide deck on a random process that really doesn't require documentation. When you're doing well they'll ""promote"" you laterally with no pay increase."

- Frequent, significant change (organizational and product direction). Managers are hit or miss and depending on your role you may be passed around to different bosses more frequently.
- Some managers are more or less understanding about work/life balance, personal life issues and significant life events. I returned from paternity leave, was assigned to a new manager (both new to me and new to his role) who was not a good match and caused me a lot of undue stress

There are constant layoffs and everyone who is halfway paying attention to the plot realizes that Cisco is going to wipe 20% of Splunk off the board. ELT is also actively avoiding difficult questions. They pack the weekly townhalls with meaningless nonsense and leave maybe 2 minutes for questions - this is clearly deliberate.

Splunk,2.0,"Jan 27, 2024",Steady Decline,Regional Sales Manager,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,Was a great company. Technology has gotten “long in the tooth” with little to no innovation. Benefits are great. Sort of a “semi-retirement” kinda vibe.,"As Cribl stated “some companies choose to innovate and others choose to litigate”. Splunk has had a steady, slow decline. Competition has blown by them. Upper management is weak, mostly due to all the talent leaving over the past 5 years so the leftovers are now at the top. Splunk is more concerned with image versus reality….sad to witness."

The number of steps to complete anything are over-processed, want to sneeze - you need 5 approvals and 10 steps to make sure you sneeze right - and as a result nothing is ever completed on time and employees don't feel trusted to do their best work because they are told constantly it isn't good enough. In all my years and companies, never seen so many smart people undervalued and a power hungry leadership who thinks they only know the answers."

Splunk,2.0,"Jan 3, 2024",Honest review on diversity,Sales,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Chicago, IL","Good brand name, onboarding is great, teammates, clients are good references.","Diversity programs are not private 
Constant turnover in sales due to lack of diversity and treatment of employees who request help from their managers and are punished and ignored for their reporting 
Not a good place for women and LinkedIn can show the lack of diversity and inclusion 

They Hire younger people and fire or layoff workers who are mostly over paid and over 50 years of age 
HR is not your friend and will hide or ignore any information that you report and their follow up will never be shared with senior management 
Management is micromanaging at very senior levels that does not allow for strategic vision from the sales reps- weekly reporting of every single task is required in slack and this is from a specific group of managers 
Limited customer support for serious needs and you are required as a sales rep to do the job of sales engineers, services and other employees jobs. It is almost impossible for a sales person to focus on strategy when there are other jobs they have to perform. 
Customers are very unhappy with so many changes and management decisions for the long term may be difficult but the lack of planning with the customers affected sales performance 
Your personal data is not protected by HR labor laws 
If you leave the company and apply at other employers the same people at the company will speak about an employee negatively and do not follow up on a single complaint. I have witnessed the derogatory comments about other employees to potential employers this should be stopped immediately as it is highly against the law. 
Layoffs and terminations focused on older women 
Sales commissions are at the discretion of HR and not labor laws 
Reporting any type of sexual misconduct is ignored by HR and they do not follow up - do not report any misconduct or you will be fired 
Several people on medical leave were fired upon return and these were mostly women 
Some of these firings took place within days of their full vesting after 4 years of hard work 
Senior management promotion of women are limited and this is a good ol boys club 
Require daily or weekly updates in slack to micromanage your team weekly work - this is a practice for a very junior team not those that have worked in their careers for many years. 
Customers are exhausted from the constant changes that don’t seem to reflect their needs first 
Requests for meetings to resolve serious disputes are ignored and blocked by HR
HR decides if you are paid on your commission and ignore the law that requires commission to be paid in full
HR uses derogatory language during layoffs and termination and violates employee confidentiality and privacy 
Stock is used as a retaliation against any employee who does not adhere to their mid level manager and threatens those who want to report harassment wjth being fired 
Managers will ask you to lie about deals and there is a problem with lack of diversity 
The discrimination is very common and this was happening for many years. 
Requests to speak to senior management is blocked or you are fired- note thst this is not widespread and only a handful of staff members are promoting this type of workplace neglect 
Stock is not worth the time because they will find any reason to lay off workers to avoid paying their options and earned salaries 
Managers are not experts or experienced managers and favors men vs women.
If you are over 40 years of age you are definitely not a good fit"

You will have to CYA to a maniacal degree to protect yourself from your co-workers. Despite an overcompensating degree of ERGs, DEI measures, etc., it’s a toxic environment. Everyone knows the party’s over, but they’re just trying to stay in for as long as they can - and they do that by trying to throw each other under the bus. A comical overabundance of middle management, with many rookie managers who really just make everyone miserable and everything worse and more complicated.

The good news is that with the overwhelming feedback from across the company around tech debt and lack of operational efficiency, the leadership team took that feedback and rolled out new process and tools to address this.

Independence in role","Great company overall, few cons would be the turnover rate is high in this company. In my team alone of about 30 people, within this year,  we lost about 5+ members not to mention the turnover rate amongst senior leaders throughout the company.

Salary is decent, but they could do better with yearly raises and bonuses. They always promote how well the company is doing, but it isn’t reflected in the raises or bonuses.

Another con would be the constant changes and lack of stability that comes with it. I’ve started under TR, then it became Refinitiv and now it’s LSEG. Too many rebrands and re-orgs which is draining.

Lastly,  is a personal preference, but I don’t like how woke this company is. Very left-wing and politicized agendas are brought up often in town-halls. I don’t care about race, gender or religion constantly being pushed in the workplace. The diversity efforts is very forced and uncomfortable.

Underpaid and overworked. They give you inadequate support and resources to do your job and you will have to improvise most of the time. This is highly technical work which you are expected to execute perfectly, but with little to no support. Managers will only promote their friends and family instead of people who are actually qualified. Leadership sits at their desks all day long and refuses to actually help. None of them could even help if they wanted because they all were hired from outside the company and don't know how to do anything job related. Favoritism is the foundation of leadership at NAIC1. They ship people they don't like to other buildings with at most 2 days' notice, so be prepared to adjust your childcare and educational schedule in the blink of an eye.

They police the floor and micromanage everyone out of the door. All of the tenured and talented employees have either quit or on the way out. The project manager is clueless and only comes around when it's time to complain about something. The last time I saw him, he walked around the floor upset that people weren't paying attention to him and we all got reprimanded for it.

We used to be treated like actual human beings. We are now treated like robots. Just parts of the dying machine. If you work here, just remember, you are replaceable and you mean nothing to this company."

World Wide Technology,1.0,"Feb 10, 2024",Very backwards company culture,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Maryland Heights, MO",Nice office space and good healthcare,"Pretty much everything else 
- pay was well below market rate. They say they benchmark against the market, but they give raises of 1-2% and when I left the company, I had been searching for a while and had gotten 5 different offers over the course of my year's job search and ALL of them were paying 25-35% higher than WWT. 
- very nepotistic, boys club mentality. High bonuses for execs of millions of dollars while refusing to give raises to the majority of employees that even keep up with the rate of inflation. 
- do not invest in resources. While I was working at WWT in the corporate Maryland heights office, the company won a large contract and didn't properly staff the warehouse to accommodate the shipments. Corporate execs then proceeded to shame the employees at the Maryland heights office to work their 8-5 desk job, then go work a shift at the warehouse in edwardsville from 6pm-11pm to pack boxes because they didn't hire enough workers. This was for no pay or benefit and they called it ""volunteering"" to fulfill a many-millions dollar contract that WWT was getting paid for. When people didn't sign up to ""volunteer,"" management accused people I worked with of not being team players. 
- the company spends money on very showy events like their Global Sales Meeting, where they fly out 1500 people from various sales/sales support positions to somewhere like Vegas to stay at a hotel like the Cosmo. Employees are forced to go, but then forced to SHARE ROOMS with coworkers. I knew people that had to share a hotel room with their bosses. No option was given to not attend the conference, and if you wanted to not share a room with a coworker/boss, WWT forced you to pay for your own accommodations. Very inappropriate and weird, especially since the bathrooms at the Cosmo have windows into the hotel room, so to shower, you had to coordinate a time with your roommate so they wouldn't be in the room while you showered and still would fear that they would walk into the hotel room and see you showering. The company spends money on things that don't matter while skimping on things like basic accommodations for a mandated work trip.

overall, this company does not have its priorities in line and needs to prioritize its employees rather than ONLY profit."

They don't really communicate with the other 95% of the work force. When they do walk the floor it's almost like they're subjecting themselves to something below them. Body language speaks alot about them. Not every NAIC/Program is equal. You can have awesome leadership in one area but terrible in another. Executive team should shadow their leaders more consistently to find where the supervisors/managers are lacking. The office/IT part of the company is treated differently than supply chain.

The workload was overwhelming, with tight deadlines and unrealistic expectations, leading to burnout. The leadership was disconnected and ineffective, while career growth opportunities were limited.

I, for some reason, thought this would be a racially diverse company, from management to the engineering staff, with a plethora of opportunities to advance your career; however, I was completely wrong! There were things that were done to me over the course of 6-8 months of my tenure at WWT that were unbelievable. I was accused of aggressive behavior racially synonymous with a certain minority group. I was accused of unprofessional behavior by certain account teams and management despite their being no evidence to support these assertions. Management was unsupportive despite there being plenty of evidence to support my claims of what I was experiencing as racial microaggressions. Management loved the terms, “coach them up,” and “right seat on the bus,” which only applies to the majority. There’s so much I dealt with in my short tenure at WWT, and despite being technically “laid-off,” I declined the severance out of principle. I wanted nothing from a company that treats minorities in the way I, and others were treated. I was offered a couple options, #1 was totally disrespectful and not really an option, and #2 was resignation with severance, I chose neither. I’m extremely blessed to no longer be at WWT. The stress from this situation added 5 years to my life that I can’t get back. I’ll leave with this final note, I only experienced these issues within a certain group at WWT. I’m not sure how the rest of the company is/was, but under the conditions I described, I’m glad I didn’t stick around to find out. These are my opinions derived through my experiences with the company. The great thing is that I have all of this well documented. I started capturing it early on in the process as part of my own professional therapy session. I’m not sure what I’ll do with the information, but I will show it to my children as they need to know what to expect when they enter corporate America."

World Wide Technology,2.0,"Dec 3, 2022",Beware of services-oriented employment,Professional Services Engineer,Current Employee,,The current health insurance plan is good.,"1) Frequent layoffs. WWT is hyper-focused on their ""Great places to work"" status, but only current employees are surveyed. Entire teams are often laid off without warning and without their ""great employer"" first attempting to relocate them elsewhere in the company or with regard to existing client contracts. This leads to a culture of uncertainty & fear, where workers are told to not to worry about the other cattle being loaded into trucks. 2) Services-oriented executive leadership is perpetually floundering. They simply don't know how to sell services, but when they do land a few deals they rapidly over-hire for those skillsets to meet anticipated future demand which never materializes, leading to a yo-yo-diet workforce. This feeds into layoffs as outlined in item #1. 3) They track every hour of your day with an internal tool requiring justification for everything. Viewed by some as micro-management is actually compensation for #2. 4) WWT thinks their ""values"" (the PATH) are unique in the industry, when in fact most large orgs have similar corporate mantras. What's unique is how hard WWT pushes these values in a cult-like manner, preached via weekly all-hands meetings and individual discussions with management centered around them. This is in addition to the billionaire chairman's ""prosperity theology"" ramblings, which may not be everyone's cup of tea."

Lots of strategic discussions if you like that.,"Too many siloes. Everyone owns ""something"", until they have it ripped away by some other ""owner"". No one actually works together. You have no power to execute change with other people who might logically work with you. Management by checklist. Quarterly partner reviews are just a dog-and-pony show - there is no effort to fix things. Partner management is all about catering to a partner, not really integrating them. It's so easy to get trapped between competing demands on your role and no one will get with you to reconcile these changes. Manager X says, ""we don't do that, I'll fire you if I catch you doing that"". Manager Y says, ""it's your fault if this fails because you don't do that task."" Managers X and Y won't ever talk to each other - you have to figure out how to tread between the two poles. As long as the partner is helping fund your compensation and the check clears, they're fine with it. No one in leadership wants to hear about problems. The approach is to ""counsel"" you out of believing that. There's no culture of solving a problem or changing an established practice. There are too many layers of management for such a relatively small company - I influence millions of dollars of revenue and I'm 8? levels below the CEO (and it's always churning - no one ever knows who is actually in charge). I'm working 2 full-time jobs, it feels like, with little practical support to navigate between them. I'd like to look for a different role in the company, but I'd be blocked by my current boss and the vendor management. I don't even know who I'd escalate to. There's no HR group with an open door policy. I'm too well known outside WWT that when/if I started looking around, it'd be very public. There's no ""quiet"" job search in my role. My mental health has severely declined in this role. I'm tired of people saying (even jokingly) that I'm going to get fired when I try to take initiative to solve things that they don't care to solve."

Culture is all depending on which location you work out of. Training programs are easily accessible and widely encouraged.","This organization is not for the faint of heart.

	Not flexible.  Too controlling manager style.  No chatting, no talking on the phone during office hour.   Office is so quite, you just need to work like a slave.  You cannot go lunch on your own schedule.  
	No trust between managers and employees.  My co-worker was asked to bring in a doctor’s note for one sick day.  Managers get nerves when people ask for sick days, because they don’t want people to go for interviews. 
	No chance of moving up in the corporate. Korean team drives the project; I did not get to design and contributing my ideas.

Colleagues are friendly. Work-life balance (compared to the other offices in Seoul) is good, but be prepared to drop your life/cancel your vacation/work for 48 hours straight if an executive comes to town at the last minute.  

The Samsung name opens a lot of doors and looks very good on the resume.","There are exceptionally limited opportunities to move up or succeed unless you are a native born Korea. It's unclear who has it worse, Korean Americans or non-Koreans in terms of being taken seriously, getting put on good projects, or even just your colleagues in Korea being willing to work with you.  Pay for expensive areas to live like Silicon Valley and Seattle is very low. 

Annual reorganizations completely ruin any long-term planning for team. Extreme focus on P&L can make investment efforts that will pay off in a couple years but require initial work to gain traction are killed before they are given a chance. 

HQ is very opaque and it is hard for regional offices to understand strategy and direction for the year. Additionally, the Seoul Office has the final say in absolutely everything. If a product is developed in Samsung SDS America, HQ will take over the project/source code from the regional office. This leaves the individuals in the regional offices demotivated in their work. All initiatives must have a sponsor in the Korean office as well, even if it is a regional initiative.

I did not want to write such a negative review but I have to in order to have others considering employment here to hopefully avoid the pain. There was so much emphasis on DEI but numerous times when there was blatant ageism. I can't emphasize it enough that you will be discriminated against if you are on the older side. Sage changed the comp plan where we could only earn commissions twice a year and had quotas that were almost impossible to attain. It's such a shame to share these details because there are some very nice people who work there. I don't miss the verbal abuse, the manipulations, unachievable goals, and unrealistic expectations. I feel sorry for those who have to still suffer there. We all deserve better. It didn't have to be so terrible with such shameful behavior at times.

Interesting work for developers using latest tech

Good processes in place

A lot of developers are passionate about creating innovative solutions","There have been a number of major missteps by senior leadership including:

Team agreements - this one is set by senior leadership and teams are told to comply not agree. So much so it's used as part of the review process (how a team agreement can determine how well someone has done is beyond me). I agree that time in the office and collaboration is a good thing, but the amount of time spent should be decided by the teams themselves not senior management who want bums on seats

""High performance culture"" - this one cracks me up personally. The CEO is giving all hands meetings talking about this while there are audio and video issues in said meetings. There is also a lot of middle to higher management who seem to not be doing a lot of work and instead impose themselves on others (directors etc).

We have now been informed of potential redundancies and restructuring etc, which kind of makes the above 2 now make sense. 

I personally think redundancies are counter active to a high performance culture. If you want the products Sage create to improve and involve you have to keep your high performers and keep them happy. You seem to be doing the opposite of that at the moment"

This isn't in relation to the changing landscape of accounting, it's just bad planning and lack of foresight.

No product leadership - Chief Product Officer appears once a year and then vanishes until the next financial year kicks off. I have no idea what his views are on anything, have no sense of his strategy for the organisation and makes no attempt to foster any sense of cohesion as a product function.

As people begin to return to the office, facilities are starting to feel the strain. Impossible to get a seat at lunch if you turn up at 12:01, I've seen people eating lunch stood with food propped on a windowsill and others eating in the ""break out"" call pods meant for having private Teams calls.

It's not a massive deal, but it's definitely changed the feel/culture. I don't think I trust the EVPs, VPs and Cs anymore. Best example of this is progression. People keep asking when the hiring freeze will be lifted, and the response is always along the lines of ""there is no freeze on hiring/progression and never has been"". This is the party line that people are being told to say, but the reality is that my team lead (and many others across the company) have been pushing for progressions for over a year and keep getting palmed off. So, the situation is that either the Directors, EVPs and other high ups who sit above my team lead simply don't actually have the clout to push a progression through (which would be worrying at that level), or we're just being straight up lied to."
Sage,5.0,"Mar 4, 2024",Exceptional Work Environment and Supportive Management at Sage!,Site Reliability Engineer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Newcastle upon Tyne, England","I am writing to express my heartfelt appreciation for the incredible work culture and management support at Sage. As a recent graduate SRE, my experience with Sage has been nothing short of remarkable, and I feel compelled to share the positive impact it has had on my professional journey.

First and foremost, Sage has introduced me to a work-life balance that I never knew was possible. The emphasis on maintaining a healthy equilibrium between work and personal life has greatly contributed to my overall well-being. This has not only enhanced my job satisfaction but has also allowed me to bring my best self to the workplace each day.

The management at Sage deserves commendation for their exceptional leadership and unwavering support. The team's commitment to fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment is truly inspiring. I have found the management to be approachable, understanding, and always ready to assist. Their proactive stance in ensuring that every team member is engaged and motivated is a testament to their dedication to employee growth and satisfaction.

One aspect that sets Sage apart is the dynamic and stimulating work environment. I appreciate how the management actively works to prevent monotony and ensures that no day is like the other. This commitment to variety and challenge has fuelled my motivation to continuously learn and grow within the company.

Moreover, the opportunities for professional development and learning are abundant at Sage. The encouragement to take on new challenges, coupled with the ample resources provided for skill enhancement, has been instrumental in my personal and career growth.

In conclusion, I am genuinely grateful to be a part of the Sage family. The positive atmosphere, the supportive management, and the focus on employee well-being have made my transition into the professional world seamless and enjoyable. I look forward to contributing my best to Sage's success while continuing to grow both personally and professionally.

Thank you for providing an exceptional workplace that fosters growth, collaboration, and well-being.","No cons, all positive, great job team!."
Sage,2.0,"Oct 17, 2023",Not as good as it used to be,Senior Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","Newcastle upon Tyne, England","Good benefits, decent pay, decent bonus if your face fits and your product sells. Office canteen is ok and reasonably priced.","The whims of management can be quite demotivational at times. They were fantastic over lockdown, but the mandated return to office is silly when we've recruited colleagues who live a long way from the offices and were recruited on the basis that they didn't need to go into an office. Now they're told they must, so we're losing good people. There's many teams which have only one person in a particular office and there's immense pressure for them to go into the office and sit on their own. Why? Management decisions are rarely communicated well. We get extensive communications on irrelevant matters, but don't get to hear about decisions that actually impact us until after they've been implemented. The back-filling of empty roles has both been frozen for most teams. This means that existing colleagues are having to take up the load which is causing more people to want to leave. There's also heavy restrictions on progressions which means that external companies are taking our good colleagues easily. The new head office lacks soul. North Park was much better and it's a shame we didn't upgrade it. Starbucks run the coffee shop when we used to have a small, high quality independent coffee shop in the office. Sage used to be the champion of small businesses! We used to be flexible on working compressed hours and a number of colleagues went onto this arrangement. Newer colleagues aren't being allowed to do compressed hours and this is just causing resentment."
Sage,2.0,"Dec 19, 2023","Great colleagues, bad management",Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,,I really had a good colleagues in the team I was in. I really enjoyed working with them and they are great people. I also enjoyed days such as Sage Foundation. Sage also has strong financial results.,"The management was not great because they cared about results and not their employees. Highly stressful role with no reward such as career progression. Particularly, crazy goals set by managers that were unattainable because I had my own work to do that I was hired for as well as goals not related to my job in order to justify my promotion. Even when these goals I believed I met after high stress, they were argued by my manager I did not meet them. I moved on from the company to be at the level I knew I was at and I've not been happier. 
I didn't enjoy working here, it was full of stress and a toxic environment by managers and higher ups. I didn't feel the company kept to their own culture and values and I felt it was more a façade. I didn't have time for training too. I heard from different teams being worried of terminations because of their skills being on the more outdated side which they used to develop their product whilst their same product was being re-made in the new tech stack with a new team instead of retraining the old team. I found management to be very backstab."

- Great colleagues
- Interesting work at times
- Commitment to volunteering/ESG nice to see","- Expected to commute to office twice-three times a week even if it means 2+ hours commuting each way - tired of hearing about how this is in the name of 'collaboration and culture' when the office is too full to be with your own team, parking is a total nightmare when you do go in, and we all know the real reason is the lease on the buildings Sage has stubbornly committed to. Everyone collaborated just fine during lockdown and ignoring the statistics around the benefits of remote work (Steve Hare has done so multiple times) is tone-deaf and comes across as an old-school mentality digging its heels in. 
- Round after round of redundancies - how can we feel happy at work when we might be next on the chopping block? Inexplicable rounds of redundancies even when company is enjoying significant profit. Colleagues with 10 years of dedication and working out of hours kicked out without a second thought. Feels greedy.
- Losing loads of amazing talent due to various things, including: inflexibility around remote work, tone-deaf C-suite, a lack of clear vision (company seems to be trying to be everything to everyone with too many activations across too many regions and products at once).
- Lack of empathetic leadership and next to no training opportunities available to employees including new managers - Sage Learning does not cut the mustard I'm afraid.
- HR are not there to help; they're there to parrot what C-suite say/want. 
- Mental health not a priority, any pleas for support or empathy on this front go ignored or denied with a coldness that is shocking in this day and age. This goes for senior management and HR."

If you can showcase your skill then advancement can be really easy, but it all depends on the quality of your manager.","Remote work was sold to us as necessary for the business with no proper justification. We're an international company, a lot of the people we communicate with are remote as we aren't at the same office. We sit there like a call centre, headsets and webcams on, not doing any real work because of the distractions in the office. Sage don't care about the travel/childcare costs incurred to us, it's not their problem. There's only two justifications I can see for moving to hybrid work, when the directors visit the office (rarely) they like it to be full so that they can film it every so often, and that they've had pressure from the canteen to get more customers. Upper management also act like cowards, changing things like hybrid working through internal twitter-like posts, instead of discussing it with us properly. This kind of behaviour has given many workers a negative outlook of Sage. Sage don't care about you, they like to shout about being human-focused but they're really not."

Over dependence on at times cryptic procedure versus solving issues in a timely manner, though this is improving. The only real con is a recent slide back on flexible work policy. There has been a mandated return to the office two days a week. This makes sense for some functions, but not others. My team for example is spread across multiple continents, as are the teams we work with on a daily basis. I am commuting to the office to join the same Teams calls I did at home. The reason given was that teams that came into the office were more productive than others, citing studies conducted. No details of these studies were provided. It was also referred to as a “Team Agreement” but there was no consultation with any team I am aware of and everyone I know was surprised by this. Explanation was very patronising and no consideration given to personal circumstances. Morale amongst team mates is at an all time low and it would not surprise me if some leave in the near future specifically because of the mandated return to office. Very little in the way of facilities in the office, or events, to make up for this."

But, getting them from the drawing board to actual fruition was a slow and tedious business. When I was promoted to a Manager, there was no training at all and I didn't know the systems. My fellow Managers were wonderfully helpful, but it still would have been great to have some sort of training. Also, they acquired my company and we pretty much sat for a year collecting paychecks and doing nothing. Then, when they did get involved, the company wasn't really given a budget or a goal.

Senior leadership has lost the confidence of the employees with yearly company targets being missed. 

Middle management and their teams are under extreme pressure and held responsible for unrealistic targets. While Senior leadership lacks accountability.
 
Monthly town halls are plagued with Q&A's about possible layoffs, company outlook, and slow product innovation.

Internal employee engagement survey concerns revolve around growth opportunities, senior management credibility, slow product improvements, salary, and compensation competitiveness.

Can observe a change in culture with the pressure to become profitable. It's becoming less people-oriented compared to when it started. Glassdoor reviews were previously 90% plus."
Carousell,1.0,"Feb 23, 2024","Low confidence, high turn over, overworked, poor compensation",Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"- Hybrid working model but tightening on work from office 
- Friendly and helpful colleagues 
- No dress code","The company's initial emphasis on a people-first culture and a strong mission orientation underwent a significant shift due to the intense pressure to achieve profitability, resulting in employees feeling reduced to mere numbers. The layoffs in 2022 left existing staff burdened with increased responsibilities, particularly impacting those tirelessly working on the ground, while management remained seemingly unaffected.

A lack of cohesion among numerous managers has led to inconsistent strategies and a palpable absence of clear direction. Frequent restructuring and a tendency to change strategies without warning create an environment where execution becomes challenging. Townhall meetings have become dominated by concerns about potential layoffs and inadequate compensations, but management became annoyed and chose to discontinue addressing these questions, further eroding employee confidence.

The organization faces a continuous exodus of talent, with monthly resignations reflecting an inability to competitively retain skilled professionals. There's a significant disconnect between management and ground-level operations, they are not even aware of our KPIs. Middle management contributes to a toxic work environment by fostering office drama, often rewarding those adept at playing internal politics rather than delivering value-added work to drive profitability goals.

Product innovation is painfully slow, and user-oriented teams, like the seller experience team, lack effective communication with platform sellers. The recent launch of integrated delivery is celebrated as groundbreaking, yet it raises concerns about the company's ability to catch up with competitors after 12 years in the industry. Recent product launches were clearly designed to squeeze their sellers dry to forcefully drive up revenue. 

Overall, there is an extreme lack of confidence in the company's ability to achieve profitability. While a focused, action-oriented approach may improve the situation, ongoing brain drain is further diminishing the chances of success. Good luck achieving profitability and cashing out."

It's the employee's choice on whether they will use this allowance for their work from home setup or gym or other hobbies.","The high level direction is clear, however the lower level strategies on how to get there is like looking at muddy water. You could be focusing on a certain KPI for half the year only to be informed that there will be changes and you need to work on something else, which is understandable. however, it would be good to at least get ground level opinion as well on how feasible a certain idea is.

Unclear professional growth/development plans, your effort may be less due to a well planned task list or your personal efficiency but you won't be as noticeable as personnel working overtime, which slowly transitions Carousell into a more traditional type of corporation contrary to their revolutionized google-style beginning.
Without a clear career path, people tend to look elsewhere for growth.

Slow tech development/improvement. Sales and marketing related app/tech drive will have less impact if customers can't have their basic needs such as a decent search function or fraud prevention features or even a more precise filter functionality.

This is just a personal opinion, but Carousell needs more visibility in Markets it caters to and craft appropriate marketing strategies that is actually applicable to the market.

Tech wise, they use GCP instead of AWS (like i said there’s no AWS :p) so it might take sometime to get used to for the folks in the AWS camp. 

There’s a lot of deprecated and poorly documented/hard to understand code because there’s no hard requirements on code standards. It makes people whom these code are handed over to miserable because they’re afraid to break things if they refactor. In general, very little best practices can been seen here, eg people commit large PRs expecting colleagues to review instead of doing a stacked PR, no formatting checks in auto test etc. It’s hard to push for a change in tech culture because the seniors are resistant. Then again, I guess all these are understandable because it’s not a tech company."

There are competitors everywhere and it won't be long before they are under extreme pressure. Growth has slowed down and the product has suffered. Leadership keeps talking about using data but only when you have an idea, otherwise data doesn't matter when they want to do something.

Innovation has suffered as a result and you can see that in the product. Very slow vs. other tech companies.

Join if you are in the early stages of your career to learn some good processes and make some good friends. For senior people, stay away. Lot of people have left and they don't have any idea how to retain the others."

Carousell,2.0,"Oct 10, 2021",Please consider these points before joining,People Team,Former Employee,,"1. Most of the employees here came from worse working environments e.g. Media agencies, toxic local SMEs, Honestbee and hence believe that this grass is a lot greener. If you’ve been through terrible work environments, yes carousell will be (slightly) better. Is it the best place to work in Singapore? Definitely not. 

2. There is autonomy to make decisions that have immediate outcomes and visibility, and on some occasions the founders will be verbally grateful to you for them.

3. Most people on the ground here are really trying their best to do what they love and work hard. And yes, if you are looking to join the marketplace experience team, or the tech team - you are most likely to enjoy your experience there. Carousell understands that tech is competitive and will do their best to treat tech hires right, not so much for the other departments. 

4. In some departments, there’s a good culture of fun and team bonding. Carousell is intentional about spending time together and bonding, and there will be budget for this too.","1. The Carousell group acquired 4 companies over the years - OLX (Philippines), Mudah (Malaysia), Chotot (Vietnam) and OneKyat (Myanmar). There is a lot of mess and neglect in this process and the founders are struggling to understand how to manage them, most people here complain of being overworked, underpaid and under-supported way more than their Carousell counterparts.

2. Management - the Glassdoor reviews that you read here are true. Even though most of management came from affluent and long standing histories of experience, most of them just want to oppress their reports. They know nothing and want to be treated like royalty - you will be asked to book meeting rooms for them, teach them how to record on zoom/order food on foodpanda, buy things for them and much more. (To be fair, most of the things experienced are in the People team - high turnover rate a clue?) You will be shocked at how they can say words with no accountability and tact, despite their “experience”. The founders are much younger than most and clearly struggle to manage them - all these incidents mentioned were bought up to the founders and no action taken, resulting in employees resigning because they gave up hope. 

3. As much as they seem to look corporate and SME-like, most people here will admit that it’s still very much like a start up. Little to no processes, constant change in systems and poor communication downstream. 

4. There is a deep systemic resentment towards salary. The context is as a startup, most employees who have been there for years received start up pay. Only up till a year ago, the management decided to pay competitively to new hires and that’s when the bitterness and comparison arose. Imagine only getting half or less of the salary of your counterpart and doing the exact same work - as much as this is common, Carousell is not an MNC and it doesn’t come with any MNC benefits. 

5. Burnout culture: is real here. As much as the people experience team tries to sell “work life balance” and “Wellness Wednesdays”, they don’t actually live it out themselves. You will see the team reply to slack or send emails at 12am-1am, people are angry and uncooperative and being told they lack resilience when they are being pushed to breaking point at work. There is deep mistrust for managers as most of them are deemed inexperienced or incompetent. The people team try to mitigate but everyone can tell that they are struggling with their own manager, too. When asked, most of them are on the lookout for better opportunities and said that they will leave in a heartbeat if the opportunity presents itself."

FYI the ‘people’ is the founders, management and ppl they like. Founders  like to appear and talk during townhall, but when it comes to execution it is zero.

Hiring the wrong people to do the wrong thing. 
- Do note that a lot of ppl they hire are ahbeng and ahlian that cant even speak properly. Most management are uncle aunty that have load of experience but have no clue how the tech and marketplace works. 

Company still not profitable.
- Imagine in the market for 10y and still losing money, this tells you how bad the company is doing. A lot of the verticals are still losing money until today. Since management are bunch or uncle and aunty, their idea of making money is to increase price of their subscription and ads for those verticals that are doing well.

Toxic Culture
- lots of politics in the company always regarding who the management likes and dislikes. For a company that is not profitable to have too many managers within a department. A lot of the associates they hire are ex-colleagues of the manages, and managers will prioritise these colleagues in terms of job assignment and promotion. 

Incompetent staff
- a lot of their managers are too incompetent. Asked their project manager a question and took him 2 weeks to answer me. He will organise a Q&A session with us, but its all questions since he cant answer us and can only note down those questions we asked and nvr answer us.

Founder is not taking this seriously.
They will come in office and chitchat with everyone like they are close friends. Talk like Steve Jobs during meeting and town halls but no have idea on execution and neither do they care."

Carousell,1.0,"Nov 2, 2021",Not a great place to work,Human Resources,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Singapore,They have flexible hours to work and inter-team mobility is available after a while. Talented teammates.,"- Culture: They talk pretty highly of their core values, but once it trickles down to following them, it's no where close. 

- Management: What they say is always right and they favor their own references and ex-colleagues when it comes down ""trust"". Personally, they don't treat HR folks as a business too so, HR opinion is the last opinion or better still ""no opinion required"" category. Highly bureaucratic/ political and very traditional in their approach and highly judgemental as leaders. 

- Attrition: a pretty high double figure attrition and a lot of people have left in HR /Tech/ product teams, clearly because they felt less heard or the leaders didn't work too hard to retain talent. Try avoiding 

- Interview process: is long, very long, very very long. They want to compete with FAANG company process but pay you peanuts in salary. They are always depending over budgets.

People team and TA team have maximum attrition this year, they say ""i hear you"" and ask you to move on. very insensitive even though they pretend to sound concerned and neglect you after sharing concerns.

Overall as an organisation, the co-founders pop up during townhalls to talk about company performance but very less invested in people and they go quiet on decisions for people. They may hear you out but they don't care to action out probably max assign your managers to deal with your issues. In that matter, none of the management really cares to hear about your concerns, it's too fake to be honest. So unless, you are a reference or you know some leaders well - you are bound to grow slowly in this space, highly biased in decisions and very likely to hear you out but not provide any solution or leave it to the managers to take biased decisions.

P.s. Carousell is more responsive on glassdoor than actually solving problems internally."

Plenty of opportunities if you seize them (and earn people's trust along the way) - Fast paced and dynamic culture. Pivot quickly, and implement new things at lightning speed. - Teams of highly talented people. People are highly intelligent and are comfortable with complexity. - Great leadership (esp CEO)","- Some tumult in business outlook, esp with BNPL closure of one market and multiple (and quickly successive) departures of key figures in that business - Lack of work-life balance. Tight deadlines, quick turnarounds, and intense stress to excel. Might not be for everyone's personality and/or current phase of life right now - Lack of diversity in strengths, personalities, and backgrounds. Results in certain traits being self-selecting over time, which can breed very rigid (possibly elitist) thinking over time. - Almost no formal DEI initiatives, and what is being done is mostly for B2C marketing campaigns (e.g. international women's day). Expect very little support as it's not seen as a company priority at all (literally the last thing on the list) - Some toxic personalities in middle management"
ShopBack,1.0,"Feb 1, 2024",Think Twice: A Cautionary Review for Prospective Employees,Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Singapore,Hybrid working arrangement is the only one I can think of.,"Working at ShopBack is challenging, and unfortunately not in the positive sense. The company suffers from a significant lack of planning, often setting arbitrary deadlines that seem disconnected from project realities. This approach breeds a chaotic work environment where overtime is not just common but explicitly encouraged. The expectation to work nights, weekends, and even holidays is glorified, with the CTO publicly praising such unsustainable practices.

While compensation is average, the expectation to deliver high-quality work under these conditions is unreasonable. Work-life balance is virtually non-existent, as personal time is frequently encroached upon by work demands.

There's a discernible culture that values compliance over competence, where 'yes men' are favored over those who genuinely contribute through hard work. This environment is compounded by a management style that fails to advocate for team members, often leaving them feeling unsupported and undervalued."

Nonetheless, the salary offered is decent. Theres a good company culture going on at ShopBack with continuous development opportunities to grow your skills.","* While the company offers AL, Sick Leave, and company stocks to vest - the downside to some of the benefits include no company provided insurance plans. Furthermore, if you travel for your role or have to purchase misc. adhoc items, you have to front the cost upfront and wait to expense the items to be reimbursed."

Bosses give a lot of freedom to employees to decide what they wanna do. it doesn't stop there, bosses are supportive in terms of giving guidance and will fight for the resources you need (of course you need to prove what you do is impactful) 3. Most people in the companies are quite willing to help each other. No question is dumb, and normally we can ask the same question again and again until we fully understand 4. People here work hard, peer pressure is healthy for most to constantly upskill themselves. a bit stressed short term, but fruitful long term 5. We also play hard. You heard of whole company annual retreat on a Yacht? or flying to Phuket, or have a whole Club (the ones with drinks and music)? ya thats ShopBack","1. processes are still quite manual. means sometimes we need to OT to get things done, while in other more mature companies, it could have been automated 2.should have been more proactive in engaging employees what skills they wanna develop and provide trainings. currently we do have IDP, but many people dont use it"

The management was known for engaging in gossip, creating an environment of mistrust and backstabbing among employees. Despite claiming to understand the challenges faced by employees in dealing with client objections, management failed to provide effective solutions. Employees were expected to maintain a high standard of work and often had to perform tasks outside of their designated roles, without any corresponding increase in salary.

I literally overheard the manager tell her family friend to bring their laptop over their house so they can train them and show them the ropes during the weekend. But for other team members when they ask the manager for help she gets frustrated or tells us she only has time to work on a certain client. Seems like management positions are given to people who are clearly not skilled enough mentally to be a leader. Negative work place environment. Contestant temper tantrums from management. Coworkers crowdsurfing your computer as they walk by your desk. Oh and during my first week working there the manager made a wild assumption that I was living paycheck to paycheck. Last VP was a racist and you could tell she could care less about the employees but more about the money being brought in. Which rightfully so but she did not have a poker face at all. Needless to say the only time you would truly enjoy working here is if nepotism favors you. I would not suggest someone who loves their life to work here as this place can make someone miserable."

HR's hiring process is a nightmare and hasn't improved the entire time I've worked at the company. The top execs are constantly getting catered lunches, which is pretty discouraging considering I can't afford to buy lunch every day on my salary.

It is a ""Unlimited PTO"" that they tried to sugar coat it but any moron with a brain can see it is only being done to get PTO balances to zero by the end of the year for the sale as all that time on the books is a negative for the company. Advent is a company like Richard Gere's Pretty Woman movie depicted. Buy companies, pick them apart and sell them to make the most money. Advent does not give a damn about our products or the people. Take away EARNED vacation which is money in the bank, and substitute a program where managers can more easily disapprove time off requests.

Everyone on my team and MANY engineers that I speak to are always mentioning how overworked they are. Our CEO recently stated in a town hall that we are eagerly trying to fill open positions. However, the head of engineering recently told his department that all openings will be closed. In addition, my team was told this week that the open position on our team that we desperately need filled will be closed. So why is the CEO telling us something completely different ? Upper management is trying to cut costs all around so we are more attractive as a company but it’s at the cost of the lower level employees. Lower level employees, especially hourly employees, are underpaid. NO competitive salary whatsoever and we aren’t even eligible for company performance bonuses anymore. We work just as hard as anyone else! We are also encouraged to use all of our PTO by the end of the year but there is so much work to be done that taking a vacation seems impossible.

A great place for yes-men to thrive; but challenge status quo and get a slack on the wrist.


 Management only cares about themselves and is not in alignment with with engineering, as evidenced by the high turnover. Teams act like independent islands not working in concert with each other.

The warehouse is the most disorganized thing I've ever seen. They give you a number and you have to search through a huge room to find a big heavy pallet that sometimes falls apart when you push it, making sheets of cards fall on you. No one was able to help me because there is absolutely no system to keep track of locations. In addition, I encountered people on the night shift staff that were blatantly homophobic, transphobic, and racist, as well as one guy that I'm pretty sure was abusing his girlfriend that also worked on the night shift. Don't get me wrong, some of the people who worked there were really great people, but management does not care at all about helping with issues. I actually remember hearing that security called some black workers into the office because they thought they saw them making ""gang signs"" over the camera. Absolutely insane. I'm not black but just hearing about the things which they go through there made me sick. Also the pay isn't worth it.

It was also important to keep track of an audit sheet that listed where every card was at every time. But nobody filled it in correctly because it was poorly laid out and we weren't allowed to edit it. We did though. Everybody did. Because otherwise we'd have to search everywhere to find the person who messed up the sheet and often they weren't even on our shift! 

When there's nothing to do you have to go through the cards and pick out rejects only for the quality control head to put them right back in because the company does not care about the product they put out.

Also I've heard that this place used to be better until they got bought out by a French company and the entire thing went downhill immediately."

Cylance AI/ML is a solid technology - but needs to be updated.

New CEO, John G, is a positive as John Chen did nothing to drive growth.

BB QNX technology for the auto industry is solid.","BB has destroyed both the Cylance brand recognition and product innovation. After I came aboard I lost 50% of my clients as they wouldn't renew - they went to S1 or CrowdStrike. I was told that MGT would revive the Cylance brand and aggressively market our cybersecurity solutions - neither of these things happened. 

Channel partners have abandoned Cylance. The big resellers/partners consider Cylance a non-factor and they are not even part of the discussion. Senior Leadership has done nothing to address this. 

Employee morale is incredibly low. 

Senior Management was horrific under John Chen (old CEO). John still believed that the Blackberry brand is strong in the world - it may be in Canada but not elsewhere. When I asked random people they said either ""I though BB was out of business"" or ""..you guys make cell phones...I really liked mine...."" JC knows little to nothing about cybersecurity and constantly waffled in his decisions - he should have retired after saving the company from bankruptcy."
BlackBerry,1.0,"Dec 6, 2023",A Sinking Ship In Desperation Mode,Enterprise Account Executive,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",,Some amazing coworkers that worked hard and wanted to succeed in spite of the continuous obstacles presented. Innovative and unique technology that was unfortunately squandered by poor leadership decisions.,"Branding and market awareness are terrible to non-existent. Marketing dollars spent are a fraction of the competition and Blackberry is still basically known as ""the phone company"".

Delusional and inept senior leadership has created the worst sales culture I've ever encountered. Completely disconnected from the realities/difficulties on the ground and stuck in a 1990's-early 2000's mindset. New logos are all but non-existent here, and existing customers are and have been leaving in droves since Blackberry acquired Cylance in 2019. If you do not have a decent existing account base (and most territories at this point don't), your chances of being successful are slim to none. None of this, however, stops senior leadership from unrealistic expectations with ludicrous timelines.

Channel relationships have been long-abandoned and discarded. The big players have long ago abandoned Cylance (Blackberry) to where the company is a non-factor and not even part of the discussion. Leadership has done nothing to address this, and in fact, has worsened the problem by burning bridges of what remained in desperation for short-term wins that resulted in permanently fractured partnerships."

Working for Blackberry can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on where you are in your career. Good if you have less experience. It's a software company with security in its name.","Blackberry is behind the curve in terms of technology and culture. When you're ready to move on, recruiters may raise doubts about your career choice of working for BlackBerry. Low pay, the executive leadership is a mess. Not able to deliver new software. High turnover of COOs in recent years. Executive leadership culture is the worst I have ever experienced. I witnessed one executive bashed another executive of minority background using inappropriate remark, and in other occasions there were remarks not respectful to women. In my own experience, HR sided with poor leadership in a way that to this day it's hard to comprehend. There was teachable moment that HR could have turned into rather than showing strong hands unnecessarily. The industry is moving towards a more humane culture. Their HR should catch up."

The weight of the sales team is carried by the renewals team because they struggle to sell to net new. By milking the renewals team as the cash cow they become very troublesome to their existing customer base.. The current sales leadership has a hard time using basic tools like Salesforce. You will get yelled at, you will be accused of insubordination if you wish to work from home, and no one has your back. It's the most toxic job I've ever held and hard to trust anyone in leadership positions. There was no opportunity for career advancement, I was stuck in the same position for over five years.

Amount of work is manageable. There are some great people I enjoy working with and who are keen to learn and grow.,Senior US based leadership doesn't care about employees as people. Recent business decisions are damaging morale and making salary and benefits even less competitive than ever. The CEO exudes negativity. He threatens and blames individual employees and teams for anything bad. Full time work from office and weak COVID policies are the last straw for many great former employees. Others are looking for better employers.
BlackBerry,1.0,"Jul 24, 2023",Never work here,Senior DevOps Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Portland, OR","Relatively easy job technically, some good team mates.","The frequent reorgs within the company have created an atmosphere of chaos and uncertainty. Paired with a lack of effective project management and clear direction, the environment has hindered productivity and made it difficult to focus on delivering quality work. Additionally, I have found that the company's support for individual employees' needs has been extremely lacking, which has affected morale and motivation, and led to many people quitting. Now is my time to do the same. The forcing of a return to the office has been a significant source of tension for me for a while now. When I joined Blackberry, it was explicitly under the understanding that remote work would be accommodated, which was a critical factor in my decision to join. The lack of consideration for this need and the insistence on returning to the office despite my concerns have been deeply disappointing and ultimately the primary reason for my resignation. Furthermore, I must express my dissatisfaction with the HR and Benefits teams at Blackberry. Over the years, I have encountered numerous issues with their level of support and professionalism. One particularly frustrating incident was when I discovered that the Kaiser insurance option, which I was promised and specifically sought out when I joined, was not initially available to me. It took months of fighting and advocating for my rights to finally secure the insurance option I was offered in my employment contract. This was ridiculous. This experience, along with many others over the years, has left me feeling unsupported and very frustrated with the lack of transparency and accountability within the company's HR and benefits departments. Throughout my time at Blackberry, I have often felt like nothing more than a number to the corporate executives. The anxiety and stress I have endured due to their inability to effectively run the company have been overwhelming. It has become increasingly evident that the organization is facing significant struggles and is on the verge of decline. Unfortunately, the corporate culture and leadership have failed to address these challenges adequately, resulting in a toxic work environment that undermines the potential for success. I can only hope that people can leave on their own terms before the company forces them to. As a disabled queer, trans non-binary, and autistic person, I expected the bare minimum from Blackberry in terms of inclusivity and provide a supportive environment in all aspects of my employment. Even that was too much of an ask, as the company has fallen short in nearly every aspect. There is a significant lack of understanding, support, and inclusivity for individuals like myself, as well as more broadly. Blackberry has the potential to do so much better, but it appears unwilling to make the necessary changes."

I work in a support role (read non-sales, non-service technician role) and am frequently overlooked. I'm pretty burned out and am staying here simply because there isn't anywhere to go (yet). I still do my job with dedication and passion (that is how I have always tried t work) but because of the Cons lited below, I am entertaining offers to leave Rohde & Schwarz. So, in no particular order, the Cons as I see it at Rohde & Schwarz at Corporate HQ (I will update this review if things significantly change before I leave the company).

- Advancement is slow to non-existent

- Some managers ""protect"" certain employees

-Staffing in support functions is inadequate (non-sales related)

- Burn-out becoming more common - good employees looking elsewhere to further career since the promotion come only to a select few 

- Recognition doesn't follow achievement - it follows self-promotion

- If you area conscientious, hard-working employee, you will be exploited. You will have more work than you ever imagined piled on you. 

- Work-life balance very difficult to impossible to maintain"

You need to seriously cool it with this savage, controlling behavior.  Not only is it insulting and distrustful, it it makes all of our jobs more difficult.  We would be 3x more efficient if you didn't have your hand around our throats.

- They like 'busy work' and will have no problem in trying to stretch their agents as thinly as possible for highest possible profit.  If they can convince one agent to work for 3 clients via pressure, they'll pay one person instead of hire three.  And not tell the clients that their agents are also working for other people.  In fact, I was told directly not to tell clients this information and keep it under the blanket.  As clients may not pay KWS as much if they know that the agent's attention is split.

- 'Team Leads' often fumble into their position of management with little to no training or previous management experience.  I've seen them yell, throw fits, and come down on entire teams of agents, demanding they work harder or faster with no compensation.  This in turn drops the quality of an entire team of people and the client's perception of us.  I've even had to correct timesheets that were overlooked by TLs on negligence, costing an agent nearly $400 in monthly pay. 

- Upper management handles feedback poorly and some may even resent you for coming forward with truths - because the truth can sometimes be damaging.  You have to be very careful who you trust and who you talk to if you want to keep your position or work your way up.  It's a social minefield.

- Disorganized management causes the agents to suffer.  Who talked to who about what?  Someone sent an email, but I didn't get it?  One TL was told something that the other TL wasn't and now the agents made a mistake and the client is upset?  Forgetting when people work or pinging agents at 4:00am off shift?  This is common.  This happens near daily.  It's communicative chaos.

I had a TL not even show up on training day because they 'forgot'.  Oh well."

Great coworkers with varied backgrounds and across all ages.

If you are interested in games, you will get to see/try new titles before the public.","The work at Keywords is project based, meaning they will call you in to work X number of days or weeks. In between projects, you will be at home without compensation. When interviewing, they may tell you to expect 2-4 weeks of downtime per year, but this is very far from the truth. There is NO guarantee that you will have work, and when they do call you in, projects tend to shift and change with no warning. This means that you might show up to work, expecting a few weeks of income, only to be told that the project has been delayed. As projects get close to deadline, aforementioned poor planning manifests itself as last minute overtime requests, often on weekends.

Management is the main problem at Keywords. The top manager has often stated to me and others that his philosophy is: ""I don't care if people hate me, because no one is irreplaceable.""

This ""Leadership Style"" lays the foundation for how employees are treated, creating an often toxic atmosphere of intimidation and fear. The rest of the management team is typically overwhelmed and therefore mostly disinterested in the well-being of testers (to them, the priority is making Keywords look good to the client, not the employees). Don't expect anyone from management to be on top of communication, and don't expect to be thanked for your work.

Compensation is low for the work and what management expects from you in terms of availability and ""loyalty"". They pay people based on a combination of how rare the languages are, and how desperate they are for filling that seat. If your language is common (such as Spanish), you will be making an hourly rate in the teens. If your language is harder to find, you can squeeze them for much more. If you do apply to work there, it's important that you know your value and ask for a matching hourly rate - because you are not likely to get a raise after you start.

While I was there, there were several examples of people who asked for a raise and were made to wait months for an answer (I waited 5 months). If you do get a raise, you risk being moved to the bottom of the list - meaning if there is another tester covering the same language for less, they will call them in before you when there is work to do. Not surprisingly, this sometimes creates jealousy and mistrust between testers.

Outside of the pre-scheduled breaks, you are expected to quietly sit and work even if there is nothing to do. This happens regularly due to poor planning, but you are still supposed to give the appearance of working on something. Again, this is so it looks good to the client. There will be days, where all you do is sit and look at a spreadsheet and wait for an email to tick in.

There is a high turnover of people, as many leave as soon as they find something elsewhere. While there, I offered numerous suggestions for how this could be improved, but was eventually told that it was not a priority, just the nature of the business.

If you are looking for a career path, you can try to work your way from tester to test lead. That's as far as it goes, though. Be prepared to go above and beyond to make yourself stick out from the others who are trying to do the same thing. I did exactly that, taking initiatives and developing tools and processes for the benefit of everyone, on my own accord, some of which ended up becoming department standards. This sort of thing is expected from those who seek advancement. However, even if you do succeed in getting a promotion, know that a lead position comes with a ton more responsibility and expectation, but your compensation will stay pretty much the same as when you were testing.

There is no HR available, should you have a need for that."

- Some interesting people to work with","Those who hold a university degree and/or have at least 2 years of relevant work experience should only consider this company in dire circumstances (beware that this company is capable of making those even WORSE). 

In anything but the most unfavorable of job markets, you could definitely find something that pays more and afford more job security and growth should you stay in the job market. Anyone who isn't a bilingual 18-24 year old with zero experience should absolutely AVOID working here unless you're interested in derailing any career momentum you may have and stress over your own personal finances.

 If you DO happen to fit the demographic mentioned above than I would recommend working very diligently during the SUMMER months between E3 and holiday release time (after that there are hardly any projects/work so you'll be laid off) to build your resume and network a bit. If you're not going back to school or have something better lined up by October, you're going to get screwed - so plan ahead and don't be victimized by this company's deceitful practices like so many others who have already commented here have been in the past. 

Their testing processes are rather lax, allowing for too many errors to end up in released products and not creating an environment for individuals to develop into the best testers they could be. This company has also had at least one issue with unreleased content being LEAKED while being contracted for a well known company - maybe that's why they LOST that contract?? 

Work here at your own risk....and SHORT-TERM ONLY. Have an exit strategy mapped out on your very first day or you will definitely lose out and end up on unemployment waiting for the phone to ring."

-First time experience in Microsoft
-Sometimes cool games to test
-Meet other foreigners from lots of diferent places","-Management is incompetent & they lie to you at interview about the type of job it is. This is not a year round job. You will be home MONTHS (not days and weeks like they say) before they call you back in, if they even call. They will not fire you because you could sue them, so they just keep lying and says that they will tell you if something comes  when there's no accountability and you're home without pay. 

-Dead end job. Sometime they say to be politically correct that the loyal, hardworking people will get hired fulltime or promoted. This rarely happened in the long time I was there (not even had ONE work review) and most of the smart, experienced people get jobs on better Microsoft teams or they go to Amazon (pays way more). Then you lose all of the best comrades.

-Testers are paid by language and not skill/experience. If you speak a more rare language, like Dutch or from Norway, you can ask for $20+ an hour but then they will just cut you after the project's over because they don't want to keep you around for that much. Spanish will pay a lot less but you do the same amount of work or more.

-People who pay there own rent can't afford to stay at this company. You will soon be forced to the streets looking for another job if you start here anyway. Why bother?? Just find a better job (and the main manager will tell this direct to you if you make a complain...he is a jerk who does not like the responsibility being the boss He secretly wants a demotion cuz' the company is quite bad) 

-Worst Boss of your career life ever guaranteed. Unprofessional, tries to do cover up, seams cool sometime, but he generally just hates every person, major stress issues. No honest work evaluation given, only criticism of his staff behind closed doors. Donald Trump would be better!!"

Our Matterhorn growth and transformation story is awe-inspiring and to be able to be even one sentence of one page of one chapter of that growth story makes me feel like I'm having an immense impact. Not to mention the Head of Executive Search and the Head of Talent Acquisition are 2 of the best bosses I've had in my 20+ year career.

If you are looking for a great place to work, when people respect each other, they value their team members and appreciate talent. This is the place for you. The senior mgmt clearly communicates throughout the organization, there is a sense of camaraderie and belonging for all employees. It has a diverse group of people from around the world and everyone's opinions matter at Iron Mountain. I feel like you can get heard and everyone is fighting to win customers - working towards presenting our best foot forward. Customer comes first and I love that everyone's always working to make this a better place to work.","Like all companies there are always things that can be a hinderance in your work like the company is too big and sometimes takes long to get things approved or done, sometimes there are too many people involved or you don't know whom to go to for a resolution in IT. But that comes with any big organization. I also think budgets get shifted, but that is also normal elsewhere. I think working with awesome people overrides all these issues that probably exist in every company. I'd pick great culture over these cons."

Yearly raises
Nothing really stands out, the yearly raises aren't even really a benefit due to the tremendously high recent turnover and layoffs.","Executives consistently mispresent the truth and hide critical information from employees. In an organizational meeting, one of the executives accidentally said ""When are we telling them we are moving"" (or along those lines) which prompted a lot of backpedaling and lies until they came clean that they were planning a major move across state and hiding that information until the last minute to prevent workers the ability to look for new jobs. 
Constant layoffs negatively affect the operational efficiency. Employees are consistently overworked and reprimanded. 
The organization ties bonuses to revenue/profit but which is a negative since they will claim a year was not profitable even though they spent 975 million acquiring a company then another 250 million acquiring a second. How is an organization that is spending nearly 1.25 billion acquiring their competition unprofitable and why are bonuses affected by that?"

During my tenure, I observed some challenges in the organizational culture and communication, which I believe could be improved. Notably, I found the decision-making process regarding layoffs to be unclear. Despite receiving a high performance review (4.0 out of 4.0), I was unexpectedly laid off. This coincided with the company hiring new team members, which raised some questions for me about the criteria used for these decisions.

For those considering employment with this company, I would advise paying close attention to the company culture and communication practices during the interview process. It's crucial to ensure that the environment aligns with your professional values and expectations for a supportive and transparent workplace."

I guarantee they will lose their jobs soon enough. CEO only cares about making his millions. He has ruined this company by buying out other companies to gain the monopoly. As an employee they literally work you to death and will keep adding more and more work.

My advice is to avoid this man. He will ruin your career and not give a damn. Many others in the company are equally as bad so you'll always need to be on guard.

Konica Minolta Business Solutions,3.0,"Dec 12, 2023",Great Work Life Balance,Admin Ops Specialist,Current Employee,"Andover, MA",Work life balance is great especially if you have a kid or in school.,The pay for all of the job responsibilities in the administration team is nowhere near enough to support a single person household. It can be difficult to work cohesively with sales if you’re a team player due to the variety of personalities.
Konica Minolta Business Solutions,2.0,"Nov 18, 2023","Good entry level job, but not a career.",Accounting Administrator,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Ramsey, NJ","There are many entry-level positions at Konica Minolta and the company is willing to take a chance on individuals who lack experience. The training was decent and managers are fine with letting you learn at your own pace. Coworkers are more than willing to lend a helping hand and help fellow staff members get up to speed.

The work environment is generally comfortable and there is a cafeteria on site. The company also hosts lots of events and activities for staff, especially during the holidays.

Their corporate roles are good for entry-level folks looking to gain some exposure to, and experience in the corporate world.","The biggest con at this company is lack of flexibility and WFH options. During the pandemic everyone worked from home. Then they implemented a hybrid policy that allowed for 2 days WFH. Then they only allowed one day a week as WFH. The 2 days WFH seemed reasonable, and lowering WFH to one day a week seemed unwarranted. They implemented some new stuff to make up for it, but what is the point? Why not just let us WFH at least 2 days a week? Most of the jobs at Ramsey HQ can be done completely remotely to begin with. Seems completely unnecessary. From what I understand, folks in upper management are allowed to work completely remotely. Rules for thee, but not for me. 

In addition, there is a high degree of micromanaging here. Seems that most managers do not care about quality of work. The only thing that managers seem to care about is if you are sitting at your desk like a good worker bee. Don't be away from your desk too often or 5 minutes late because someone will tattle on you. Also, don't ask for too many days off or your manager might get annoyed. A lot of long-time employees will be rude, disrespectful, and bossy. Some of the disrespect you can experience is truly shocking. But it seems like people just put up with it because KM is the only place they have ever known and they are afraid to leave."

Complexity of Projects: Some projects at TCS have been overly complex, requiring extensive problem-solving skills from business analysts. While this offers learning opportunities, it can also be overwhelming at times.

Workload Management: Despite efforts to promote work-life balance, there are occasions when project demands encroach upon this balance, necessitating careful time management and boundary-setting by employees."

The management are ""yes men"" to their clients, regardless as to whether the ask is in the scope of the contract or even achievable.

There are a ton of profile and systems you have to do upkeep on that as a new employee I didn't know about until I was in trouble for not doing them. After initial training which is more of a ""how to code."" tutorial then training on the company, what you know is completely up to the first manager.

Also, how much you are involved with and enjoy your job is really dependent on the project. My first project I was treated like a temp worker and not even allowed to touch the code. I was strictly supposed to review logs and figure out where the problem was (not even solve it! Pass it on to someone else after that). There was quite little for me to do day-to-day and I became very discouraged. I would also be berated for not doing things that I was never told to do or HOW to do, to the point where another co-worker had to act as a buffer between me and management there.

My next assignment was much better in the beginning! I was treated like an employee who knew what they were doing and was given time to learn the code base and then was immediately expected to contribute. I loved that! Things started to go south later on because we started getting new team members and I was expected to do my job and also manage their jobs, even though I was just another developer. It was to the point I was working late because 80% of my day had been taken up with making sure they got their parts done as I was asked by my team lead.

In addition to that, this job has no employee protections against overtime or limits on working hours or days. If the client/project needs you after your 8 - 4 shift to come in 9pm to 12am you just HAVE to and no, you will not be paid for those hours. There was one point they wanted me to work 14 days straight, overtime on some of those days, with no breaks and no additional pay incentive. Yikes."

DocuSign's commitment to fostering a phenomenal company culture is evident in every aspect of its operations.

The company emphasizes openness and transparency at every level, creating an environment where employees feel valued and empowered. From top leadership down to individual teams, there's an evident dedication to listening, understanding, and incorporating diverse perspectives. This open communication culture encourages collaboration and innovation, fostering an atmosphere where everyone's ideas are heard and respected.

What sets DocuSign apart is its unwavering drive for success. The company not only sets ambitious goals but also provides the necessary support and resources for employees to achieve them. There's a palpable sense of motivation and enthusiasm that permeates throughout the organization. This drive is contagious and inspires employees to push boundaries, take initiative, and strive for excellence in their work.

Moreover, the leadership at DocuSign is commendable. They lead by example, embodying the company's values and vision. Their commitment to transparency and accessibility further amplifies the culture of openness within the organization. They encourage feedback, embrace change, and actively support the professional growth and development of their employees.

In addition to the fantastic culture, DocuSign's dedication to diversity, equity, and inclusion deserves applause. The company's initiatives to create a more diverse workforce and an inclusive environment are evident and appreciated.

Overall, DocuSign is not just a workplace; it's a community that thrives on collaboration, openness, and the pursuit of success. Working here has been an enriching experience, and I'm continually impressed by the company's commitment to its employees and its values.","DocuSign undoubtedly stands out as a leading company in the industry, known for its innovative solutions and exceptional culture. However, as with any rapidly growing organization, there are certain aspects related to company growth that merit consideration.
One area where DocuSign's rapid growth can sometimes present challenges is in maintaining seamless internal communication and coordination. As the company expands and diversifies its offerings, there may be instances where different departments or teams face difficulties in aligning their goals and strategies. This rapid scaling can sometimes lead to complexities in interdepartmental communication, potentially impacting the overall efficiency and cohesion within the organization.

Additionally, while growth is a sign of success, it can occasionally create a sense of unpredictability or instability among employees. The swift expansion and evolving strategies might lead to changes in roles, structures, or processes that could affect employee morale or job stability, particularly if these changes are not communicated effectively or if there's a lack of clarity regarding the company's long-term vision.
It's important to note that while these challenges exist, DocuSign's leadership and management teams are proactive in addressing these concerns. They acknowledge the hurdles associated with rapid growth and are consistently working towards enhancing internal processes, fostering better communication channels, and ensuring that employees are equipped to adapt to changes effectively."

Manager tanked a large deal and client said he was horrible to work with and when I tired to save the deal they said they were 100% sure they were going with Docusign but the manager made it sound like they were the bad guy because they looked at other competition as their decision making process. They followed up a response to me that with they wished they worked with me in the whole process, but again, my manager went over my head and took over the deal and tanked it. I was #2 on my team and was put on a PIP that was cut short because it was his word vs mine, and ultimately cut. In the same timeframe 5 other colleagues in my org who have been there for years jumped ship. News to broke out a week later that a private equity firm is about to buy out Docusign.

They treat their employees well, offer great benefits, stock options, mental health days, and are undoubtably the best product in the market.","Now is not the time to work in sales. Quotas are rising, territories are getting split in two year, seemingly year over year, and attainment is at an all-time low. DocuSign performed extremely well in the pandemic. However, continuing that growth at that rate was not realistic. Stock options are worth 40% of what they were due to management's inability to forecast our numbers.

The commercial org is really strugglingly across the board. OTEs are already incredibly low for market standards - and no one is hitting quota. 1/26 reps in the commercial FinServ org hit quota in Q4 (across all segments). People are unhappy and are really starting to look elsewhere. I worked at DocuSign for two years. Year one, virtually no turnover. In the past 6 months, there has been a ton (and many more are on the way out.)

There is no training program for sales. If this is your first sales job, it's sink or swim.

Our CEO told the company all-hands everyone would be getting raises. In the next call, our CRO specified - ""everyone but sales"". This really set the sales team off. The MDRS got raises, but the AEs and sales managers did not.

A relatively high performing MDR is out earning a commerical AE. Because of this, many MDRs don't even want to get promoted to AE - it's virtually a pay-cut if you're not an allstar AE."

Even when you are hitting your numbers, meeting quota, and showing up every day; in the end that won't matter at all. I bust my BUTT every day and it just does not matter to anyone outside of my internal team. I hate this.

So my question is...what does it take to stay at a company if meeting/exceeding the requirements doesn't secure your position? We hire one new leader and she destroys a department. This is a business so I get it but when are leaders going to start taking accountability for loss?"
DocuSign,2.0,"Feb 10, 2024",From Innovation to Desperation: The Decline of a Once Beloved Company...,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",,"This was once a place where creativity and dedication were nurtured, where employees felt valued and part of something greater than themselves.","The appointment of a rookie CEO marked the beginning of a tumultuous era, characterized by a series of misguided decisions that seemed more akin to a high-stakes gamble than strategic leadership. Within the span of 18 months, the company has had three layoffs, each a direct consequence of ill-conceived strategies that failed to address the core issues at hand. The promise of a leaner, more agile organization has instead left DocuSign threadbare and struggling to maintain the quality and innovation that once defined it.

Equally disheartening is the role of its Board of Directors, whose detachment from the company's operations and culture is palpable. Their decisions, often made in the echo chamber of the boardroom, reflect a startling lack of understanding of our industry and the people who dedicate their lives to it. Their actions, or at times inaction, have not only jeopardized DocuSign’s financial stability but have also eroded the trust and morale of those who remain.

The current senior leadership seems hellbent on undermining the very foundation of the company's image and goodwill. The external narrative being crafted is one of success and forward momentum, a stark contrast to the internal reality of uncertainty and discontent. The disconnect between the public facade and the private turmoil has only served to alienate long-standing partners and customers, who once relied on DocuSign’s integrity and transparency.

The executive decisions of late, rather than being uplifting and uniting, have only served to further demoralize an already beleaguered workforce. Initiatives that once would have sparked innovation and collaboration now fall flat, as the overarching sentiment is one of survival rather than growth. The relentless drive for cost-cutting and efficiency, while necessary in moderation, has been pursued with a zeal that disregards the human element essential to DocuSign’s success."

Almost the entire C-Suite has changed in the past 2-years. Every new executive comes in thinking they can do it better but they end up making it worse and falling back on how things were before.
- Executives have a weird level of involvement. It's all or nothing. Too much or too little. It can feel like they either don't exist or they pop up out of no where with a fire drill. 
- The product roadmap has been rebranded with the same content every single year for the past 5 years. There are rumors of a big new product and feature set but I will believe it when I see it.
- There's a lot of female and minority leaders that have left the company. When I started, leadership was incredibly diverse and it slowly went back to the good ole boys club from yester-year. The first club was like a frat house and I guess it now feels like a country club? Either way, it's sad to see so few women or diversity in leadership. This has got to change.
- Layoffs are beginning to feel like the new normal. In 2 years we have had 3 layoffs. Managers have zero insight into this or input into who leaves so it's a shock to all.

It's the best place I've ever worked, especially since I'm at the point in my career where I value work/life balance, while also making a meaningful, visible impact. 
The main pros for me -
Empowered to make decisions about the area I own
Expectation and encouragement to innovate
Work life balance - no expectation to work late or on the weekends. It still happens sometimes, but its certainly not worn like a badge of honor like it is at many companies
Great company culture and expectation for everyone to be helpful, responsive, and kind","Despite these cons below, I think we're turning the corner and things will be improving
Cons for me -
Stock not performing great currently
Working on coming out with new products and integration of products, but will take time
A lot of new execs and may have more changes coming down the line
Good comp but lower than some tech companies. To me, the work/life balance is well worth the lower tech comp that is still higher than other industries"

Opportunities to grow exist, but are hard to find. It really depends on your team and I've been lucky in this regard.","The company culture has changed over the years. When our current executive staff took over, they mentioned they loved the company culture and that's why they joined.

-There is potential to set us apart from our growing list of competitors which would alleviate a lot of pain as a seller

-Pay is decent","-Quotas are completely unattainable; about 10% of the reps in my direct organization will hit quota. It's mainly because they have bigger/better accounts within industries that have a higher propensity to buy than the other 90% of the reps and/or they were lucky enough to get territory overcarve from people who left. Just about every one of the bigger deals sold in the org this year have been right place right time situations and have been eSignature centric vs strategic deals/CLM deals

-Zero advancement opportunities. On top of the fact that quotas are nearly impossible to hit, there are virtually no advancement opportunities when you get to the Majors level or above. DocuSign was known for advancement opportunities for so long, but now there's no light at the end of the tunnel outside of just being able to keep your job. 

-Justifying the cost of our eSignature platform is becoming increasingly harder, especially to organizations that don't have very complex use cases. eSignature is becoming commoditized but leadership still thinks we should be able to charge outrageous prices just based off our name

-Sister teams like the renewal management team are not on the same page with AEs because they are compensated differently. RMs are compensated to mitigate churn while AEs are compensated on growth. This causes many scenarios where a RM will do anything to get a flat renewal which often takes any upsell off the table for AEs

-Morale is completely in the toilet. I am working twice as hard this year for half of what I made last year and I know that most of my peers are in the same situation. Everyone is in constant fear of losing their job which makes selling harder than it already is

-Executive leadership isn't doing much to turn things around. It's becoming more clear that the CEO and President of worldwide Field Ops came for a quick and easy pay day instead of truly trying to right the ship and their arrogance is palpable. The CEO laughs at questions during town hall meetings while the president of field ops is traveling to a different country every other week to do whatever he does. They say they're committed to the cause, then sell millions worth of stock the second they get the chance"

Fast forward to today, customers are frustrated and don't see the value they once did. The cost of our solution doesn't help, we're the most expensive eSignature provider out there. And while we could justify it several years ago, we can't anymore. As if that weren't frustrating enough, we're now tasked with more busy work than anybody knows what to do with. It's literally taking away our ability to engage with customers and shouldn't that be the main focus right now?

Sr. Management frequently blames macroeconomic/extenuating circumstances for poor performance, lack of support for employees-middle mgmt, and ever-harshening/moving metrics and targets. All of which result in rapid burnout, directionless trajectories for careers and department, and the programs to enable personal & professional advancement are mediocre and not prioritized. 

Benefits are top notch but fall behind in the enterprise space and even other local tech companies.

OKRs are might help startups, but they more often then not create bottlenecks from incomplete programs and ideas, unnecessary additional layers that don’t communicate well, or even admin rights to dif systems that leave when people leave the company. 

Promotions/raises are unreasonably unattainable"

Some teams have strong work/life boundaries. Utah employees have access to a myriad of additional benefits through Qualtrics' partnerships with local companies.,"Employee experience management is all but non-existent internally at Qualtrics. Originating from the C-Suite, the company has developed a culture of hypocrisy that pretends to be a culture of empathy. In addition, Qualtrics has unfortunately followed the rest of the tech industry in mandating RTO, reducing fringe benefits, halting the internal promotion process, and conducting periodic mass layoffs to give boosts to EOQ metrics."

Good diversity relative to similar companies.,"Qualtrics has been circling the drain for a while now. Private equity bought the company out this past summer and has been slowly gutting it. Big layoffs recently, many jobs moved to lower cost locations and other countries, no leadership accountability whatsoever. Total chaos followed. RTO enforcement coming. Pay cuts (or absence of refreshers) likely coming. Everyone good is looking to leave soon. Product is also incredibly boring to work on although I don't personally mind as long as working hours stay low. Not a single person in the C-suite deserves to be there. They are driving the company away from being a survey platform (which we excel at) to being a management suggestion tool (which we're bad at and customers don't need). They set on this path when the economy was good, and many customers were shelling out for a luxury product and making decisions based on employee and customer feedback. But now that the tech economy is bad, decision making is driven only by profit, making Qualtrics' experience management insights irrelevant. For example, Qualtrics can tell Delta that customers want extra leg room on flights. But Delta doesn't care, they need the money from those 3 extra rows. It is a rare case when Qualtrics can provide an insight that 1.) is novel and 2.) is actionable in a profitable way."

They cut their entire DEI team and the high level people at the company are primarily all white mormon men.

Just some examples: 1. Look at the senior leadership team. Most of the time, very little representation of women at the highest levels, and when there is, it’s usually in people ops or training/enablement. 2. I know for a fact that at least one male coworker who had less experience than I did started at the same time at a notably higher salary than me or my other female counterparts. 3. At one point, I learned that no woman on my team had ever gone on maternity leave and been allowed to come back to her same book of business, and only one had even been enabled to come back to her same role. Nobody ever thought to create a coverage plan policy to help avoid this. 4. Managers actively discourage men from taking their fully allotted paid parental leave. 5. The ratings system and policies mean that women who go on maternity leave are set back as much as a year when it comes to promotion opportunities, even though they are often only gone for 12 weeks. Any equity in representation seems to devolve to tokenism and making numbers look good. I am sure that much of this inequity comes down to unconscious bias stemming from the LDS roots."

Diversity: All of the President level and all of their direct reports are men. The majority are white, Mormon men. Women have no seat at any table. And it's worse for people of color. Valuing the function of PMM: From the top leader on down, there is no understanding or value of the function of PMM. They think PMM makes slides and have reorged in a way that anybody with a heartbeat is put into PMM. Some of the people are brilliant in their own area whether that's Solution Strategy or Industry, but simply assigning someone ""you're now a PMM"" when they have no certifications from Pragmatic Marketing and no experience truly doing inbound and outbound PMM is just absurdity.

Industry - customer experience and employee experience are fundamentally positive concepts. You can feel good about the work you do because the ultimate goal is to make companies treat customers and employees better.","There have been an abnormally large number of negatives working for Qualtrics.

Toxic Positivity - a large majority of the company would prefer you act positive and enthusiastic all the time, even if there are problems to be solved. Bringing up problems gets you labeled as difficult to work with and can negatively impact your career progression. You also wind up getting ignored a lot.

Product Roadmap - the leadership and strategy for the product is severely lacking. For a technology company, it’s a bad sign when there isn’t a clear strategy and path forward. ChatGPT and other LLM-technologies also represent an existential threat that leadership doesn’t seem to acknowledge.

Arrogance - most middle management or senior level employees believe they are such experts in experience management that they often talk down to customers and coworkers. Even if you join from a competitor, they will make sure you understand that they are the experts and your previous experience does not count. This was not specific to one team; it is a characteristic broadly across most customer-facing roles. Customers often get frustrated by this arrogance because experience management theory doesn’t always align to the practical implementation that customers are experiencing.

Pay - excluding engineering and excluding Utah-based employees, the pay is average. Various benefits, including health benefits, are quantified and accounted for when talking about compensation, even if other companies only use your base salary and bonus by comparison. It is a disingenuous way to artificially inflate your compensation.

Resistant to Change - the company is constantly talking about the past. The hyper growth era for the company is over but most tenured employees refuse to adjust their mindset to the current state of the company. Tenured people get promoted into roles because they might be able to guide the company back to where it was 5+ years ago, when the reality is that new voices and skillsets are desperately needed. There are also a lot of people (~30%+) that have never worked for another company in their career."

The common employees are the best part of this company.,"Top level leadership is incompetent, greedy, and hypocritical. Employee experience is the last thing on their minds, and it has continued to plummet with the recent acquisition by private equity, SilverLake.

4 day RTO and 2 weeks remote ""benefit,"" enforced if you're unlucky like me and get a bad manager

Comp is getting worse, and promo opportunities have severely decreased, now dependent on a ""business need"" rather than strictly merit/readiness.

WLB is heavily team-dependent, but my experience has ranged from okay to terrible, being asked to work on an occasional weekend or late nights.

Some terrible managers and politics with arbitrary deadlines being pushed onto employees from leaders and no way to push back."

They mandated return to office and gave most remote employees an ultimatum to relocate or get laid off on top of the most recent layoffs and other employees simply got told they would be let go in March next year. The relocation letters had no compensations other than being told you'd be reimbursed (no details on dollar amount). They did another round of layoffs even after we did one at the start of the year and they told everyone there wasn't going to be another one this year. There's no transparency and instead of even offering pay cuts or doing pay cuts across the board (including the CEO) they would rather just bleed valuable talent from every single team in the company. Most people I talked to don't see themselves sticking around long term (me included). Maybe if things get better."

They have a lot of programs for the employee benefit: Lyra Health, a hotline for minority employees to get help (not very helpful), employee groups…but they still struggle with DEI. But they are at least aware of what needs to happen and make an effort to be considerate/inclusive. Decent annual/quarterly planning.","I got stuck under two terrible managers back-to-back. One manager I reported to HR. I know of three other women that reported him to HR and they still protected him and gaslit us all individually. Although I was told I was exceeding expectations during performance reviews, I never received a raise or promotion. My career growth was stagnant here and I saw no way up rather than getting out, in which I was able to start at a new company making $30,000 more. Tableau was acquired by Salesforce, which is also still making it difficult to be at Tableau right now. Salesforce has a bit of a cringey culture that can be toxically positive. There are also obvious pay gaps between employees doing the same level of work but they’re able to make it acceptable by keeping underrepresented groups at lower levels. Some incompetent mid-level managers who are good at puffing their chests and using buzzwords."

The woman leaders we did have were very in their masculine and unrelatable. We grew very quickly and it felt very clunky. Communication was siloed within the orgs. and often times was conflicting ( For example we had a foosball table in the kitchen but told not to use it.... I didn't care about Foosball, but to me it seemed like the company wanted to seem ""cool"" for the outside, but that was not the reality we where living..)

* SF actually does throw its weight around on social & environmental issues in a way that makes you feel good","* Salesforce made a GREAT sales pitch about the acquisition, but that good sales pitch isn't reality
* Senior and tenured employees are leaving in droves — far more than a typical M&A — due to changes in how work gets done, talked about, and prioritized in the new Salesforce world
* Most employees do NOT use the product anymore and have no incentive to do so — and no repercussions for straight-up refusing to learn (a thing that is becoming common)
* It has become harder to operate in ambiguity and harder to operate in general with all the extra SF training, enablement, weekly All Hands, VPN-switching, clunky security (sometimes 2FA more like 4 or 8FA), and admin overhead
* Fewer opportunities for internal mobility and compensation growth
* A lot more ""just outsource that new headcount to India"" behavior
* The stock cliff has gotten far worse after the acquisition for lower-level employees — higher level ICs and managers are looked after marginally better"

When you can and can’t take your PTO is extremely controlled (i.e. three black out days at the end of each month and eight and the end of each quarter), sales will walk all over you and management will do nothing about it. Over half of Deal Desk’s work was transferred to OM without any adequate compensation or tangible training. This team is continuously treated as entry level when this is clearly not the case - it was three years ago but once DD decided to hand over the majority of their work, this team requires some form of experience in the workforce and for some reason managers continue to hire people with no form of knowledge. Tableau is notorious for underpaying their employees - making less than $60k in tech while living in the city of Seattle is just unacceptable. There is no encouragement for career growth. Since COVID hit, management has had no regard for personal time and increased the work load while barely addressing a worldwide pandemic. Management has failed time and time again to have any sort of communication skills with their team. Seattle is full of startups - apply to literally any of those before Tableau."

No communication from leadership on the path to a promotion and lots of new rules because of Salesforce. Yet be prepared at the end of each year to be bounced to a new team or territory with zero say and then told you have to stay there for a minimum of 6 months. Sales enablement is a joke. Management spends zero time mentoring, training or even reviewing deals with their team. Pay is way below market. Nearly everyone is unhappy and looking to leave this sinking ship.

Salesforce is very considerate of individual people's tolerance for risk during the pandemic and prioritizes our health and comfort levels.","Cannot overstate how underpaid and overworked existing employees are. Without RSUs anymore (removed during the Salesforce acquisition) many talented individuals have left for other opportunities and salary offers of 50%+ more (no exaggeration).

This has left existing Renewal Managers to ""pick up the slack"" often double, triple coveraging. Double coveraging has become the norm and status quo. This has lead to a general burnout and low morale. 

Migration to Salesforce system was horrendous. Completely under prepared (~2 hours of live training, several ineffective e-learning modules, hard to track documentation). Countless sleepless night and breakdowns for many Renewal Managers as Customers yelled at us for losing access to Tableau due to our inability to quote and renew on time. 

Leadership's toxic positivity. If you don't ""drink the Koolaid"" you're viewed as a negative Nancy, ignored and passed for promotions. The leadership team full of young, white fat boys with fragile egos can't take an ounce of constructive feedback. They will never own up to issues laid out by the team leaving persistent issues unresolved. The denial is deep. No wonder why everyone is leaving.

Tableau is gone and Salesforce has swept in to ""scale"" the business. Another fancy tech buzzword for automating our jobs away. ""Scaling"" is actively being accomplished with a multi pronged approach:

- replacing back fills with cheaper, contractors from the Philippines 
- tying our compensation to multi-year contracts
- defaulting renewals to automatically renew
- chatting with ""bots"" to get our job done. can't even chat internally with a real human being for help

Concerned about the job security of this role."

Many staff members are veterans and their service is celebrated. Certain positions within the company are compensated very well and above industry standards.  This company values diversity. They value college degrees, but also recognize industry experience can sometimes be as valuable as a post-secondary education.

As a part of a global corporation, employees have opportunities to not only learn about, but potentially visit or be transferred to new countries.","The medical benefits are pricey compared to other similarly-sized companies. There is a lack of autonomy for anyone who is not in senior management or a sales rep. Processing time for normal tasks is slow (i.e., the company is run very democratically in that all senior managers must approve ideas, procedures or projects and it complicates and sometimes halts progress). When being hired, you are sold on a vision of what the company can be. The reality is that the company does not yet reflect what their vision is, although they are taking dramatic steps to make their vision a reality. As a result of this, newly hired employees sometimes feel as though they've been promised things that rarely (if ever) pan out. Many employees work many more than 40 hours per week due to the company having previously been run as ""reactive"" versus ""proactive"". While the company is no longer run this way, current employees are still feeling the effects and paying the price for leadership decisions that were made a over a decade ago.  A small portion of the employee base earns salaries that are 10-25% below industry averages."

I perform a specialised job, and have a first class degree from a top university, and working for Civica has ruined my confidence in my aptitude. I have received seven years of outstanding appraisals, which have not been rewarded in any tangible way. In the seven years I have worked here, my salary has increased by less than £5,000. The upper management of the company waxes lyrical about the consistent topping of the last year's profits, but this isn't seen by those of us overworked on the ground. 

I, and some of my senior colleagues have petitioned to management for my promotion, but because I have been willing to speak out on the iniquities we face, I have been persona non grata with senior management for a while now. Colleagues who joined at a junior level to me in other departments regularly have starting salaries of £7,000 more than I am currently on - and that is after me giving seven years to the company. With the recent cost-of-living crisis, I had to apply for Universal Credit because my salary is so abysmal - in a specialised job, this, to me, is absolutely unforgivable. When I spoke to one of the senior management team about this, I received the following rebuttal: ""well, not all of us have noticed the cost-of-living crisis, especially as I haven't got a mortgage anymore"". For me for a couple of months last year, it was choosing between paying my rent and eating, and those higher up the chain haven't even noticed the difficulty the rest of us we have been having. My rent went up by 20%, but I have received a real-terms pay cut for the past three years.

- Restructure: No attempt was or has be made to listen to the views of those staying. Teams were left to discuss and fill in the many blanks amongst themselves. 

- Sales: Allowing so many to wait so long to understand their targets and commission structures doesn't seem fair, especially after making so much change (cross product, region focus)

- Support: Is being stripped to the bone. The aim is to be ""Gov Tech Champions"" but this is going to be done by delivering on a shoestring. 

- Product: the aim to cutback to only work on revenue generating development won't work in a SaaS business. Products need to be serviced and maintained. 

- Services: the constant aim to turn a 35% to 70% utilisation overnight is unrealistic. It is now helping the wellbeing of staff to keep hammering at this.

Zoom Video Communications,1.0,"Dec 18, 2023","Zoom is lying about layoffs by doing aggressive and false PIPs rather than saying ""layoff""",Senior Account Executive,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,Zoom used to be the absolute best. Sad...,"Zoom used to be the greatest company to work for. Zoom even won multiple ""Best Places to Work"" and ""Best CEO"" awards in the past. 
Now, Zoom honestly doesn't seem to care about any of its 
employees.

Eric Yuan doesn't even seem happy anymore. His All-Hands meetings seem robotic and required, rather than energetic and emotional. 

Sales is an absolute mess. 
You have new Sales Managers who come in and blatantly lie to their reps, and encourage them to quit whenever they hit at any concerns or voice issues. They are more concerned about loyalties to their managers and careers than caring even slightly about their team or doing the right thing. 

You have Small Business AE's who sell Major's size accounts that are wildly out of segment, and then that rep gets praise and President's Club, while other reps who have had their territories 3 times in a year are told they don't work hard enough. 
When brought up to leadership, they tell you to stop complaining.

They continue to tell us we won't be doing more layoffs, but then secretly, what you hear instead is that many people are being put on incredibly aggressive and unattainable PIPs so that they can justify firing people for ""bad performance"" rather than saying they are doing more layoffs. 
When asked about this during company all-hands or meetings, they brush it off or ignore the question altogether. 

Zoom used to be a rocket ship but leadership (the remaining ones as the good ones seem to all be leaving or have already left) is making this rocket fall not just back to earth, but into the deep ocean."

There are oftentimes small or department-wide competitions to keep everyone constantly squeezing for more, and the prizes are seductive, incentivizing, and effective at their goal. Nothing inherently wrong with this, just that what gets sacrificed in all the sales reps (from the bottom tier to the top) vying for infinitely increasing accounts being onboarded is the prospects, the taste Zoom leaves in their mouths, and ultimately our brand image (in the eyes of those who've been on the receiving end of a prospecting campaign). - Another ""con"" is that Zoom is taken in with the woke ideology and seems to be vying for that ESG money (if they aren't receiving it already). Diversity hires are abundant, and the bi-weekly company-wide virtual meetings spend a significant portion of the meeting either highlighting the latest woke advocacy group that Zoom donated boatloads of money to, or reading employee-submitted Q&A questions, most of which relates to DEI, be it internal company matters, or sometimes public current events that Zoom had some ancillary role in. (This was especially relevant during the COVID lockdowns and the 2020 election season.) The money pits veneered with chartable optics seems to evade Zoom's upper management / executive board, or they simply don't care what the money is going toward (i.e., BLM) so long as the PR the company receives is good. And don't forget that ESG score. I personally didn't like that I was part of an organization that panders to the superficial games of grievance politics. If they were truly colorblind / genderblind / equal opportunity in their dealings, there would be no mention, let alone promotion, of these various grievance groups."

Of course, the first condition is that the individual is willing to work hard. All employees are allowed to express their ideas. In the past 16 years, although I have followed different companies and worked with various departments, I have always been able to complete tasks happily. In the process of work, there will be inevitably difficult times that require hard work. However with the completion of every task, the satisfaction gained from internal recognition for my creative work, by my colleagues and the praise from customers, motivate me to continue to work.

Can’t think of anything else that’s nice","The turnover rate especially for marketing team is extremely high. All the new people that joined barely stayed for a year and left. Company goes through restructuring very often. They were not able to higher senior manager to cover the ones that left for more than a year and expect remaining staff to cover the role without proper compensation. Executives & Senior Executives without managers are expected to do managerial duties, have managerial expectations set on them but they’re not willing to compensate fairly. Every time someone leaves from the team, instead of getting proper replacement so that the team work load is balance and well-managed, it is stressed on the remaining staff and often told to staff that this is a “learning opportunity”. Over work culture is celebrated. Staff that is willing to work till night, weekends, are the staff that they like & those that set boundaries for themselves are deemed as not performing to their expectations. Marketing team leader loves to send emails and whatsapp late into the night because that’s when she checks her email. Love to set meetings with staff without proper agenda or expectations laid out on what the meetings are for. 1-1 meetings are just to update workload instead of talking about employee development, goals etc. “Leader” thrives on being extremely busy and overwork, you see her running around from 1 meeting to another everyday and have to wait at her desk after office hours if you need to ask her anything urgent. A company filled with employees that are just there sitting and waiting for retirement and new younger staffs barely last more than 1 year. A high blame culture where something goes wrong or a mistake is made, then that person will be remembered and blame for that mistake forever. Senior managers love to gossip about the members of the team. HUGE clique culture, if you’re not part of their clique then trust that they will talk ill about you and you can kiss promotion goodbye because it depends on whether they like you or not. Loves to gossip and talk about the people that left and make them the problem even though nearly 6-7 staff from the team left within just the first half of 2023. And the ones that left don’t get replaced so the workload gets pass down even down to executive level functioning without a manager. Think twice before joining especially if you’re just thinking of joining due to its company name, FUJIFILM. It’s not a tech company even though they try so hard to be one but they can never function or even be on par as other companies due to backward thinking, messy management + toxic culture. Let’s not forget they love to be called a happy family. So think for yourself."

Like other reviews mentioned, there is high-turnover and therefore management consists of  employees who have moved into roles not based off of their qualifications but their tenure. Many of the high level managers have poor communication and people skills. You can often find them displacing blame to lower level employees/contractors instead of attempting to fix the ""root cause"" of the issue (a core value they often stress). 

The systems they have in place are laughable but instead of making any attempt to fix it, they ultimately lack of ownership and accountability when things go wrong. 

They set RIDICULOUS expectations KNOWING their processes, applications, and systems are 70% of the problem. Absolutely baffling approach in this day and age.

ASUS,2.0,"Aug 26, 2013",Poor management/culture,Service Support Specialist II,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Fremont, CA","Employee's
-Immediate team co-workers are nice and helpful

Stable employment
- If you work in the service/support team your job is very stable. Cannot say the same for sales since there are new people every 6 months.

Company Events
2-3 events a year. Usually a company winter party (February) and a event in the summer (July).","Lack of training 
- New products come out all the time and there is absolutely ZERO training on these products. You can acquire an item to test however it would take about 2-3 days to finally receive this unit. Due to the lack of training your customer support quality will suffer. If someone complains to management about the poor support, you will be to blame even though there is non-existent training. I cannot emphasize how ridiculous the lack of training here is. 
- When you start you are taught how to do 1 task, that is it. Everything else is up to you to ask/inquire about. 
-Requesting training is an option? Co-workers and myself have requested training on various products several times within the last year. It took nearly 7 months of constant requesting to receive 1 general tablet training. Expect Google to be your best training

Work load
- You will be given a mass amount of work. I believe I am a fast and efficient employee while maintaining quality and there are days where you will have 2-3 days of work to complete on 1 day. 
- Key Performance Index(KPI) - You will need to keep track of each assignment you do every day and log it. This means every phone call, every email, every chat, anything you do; you need to keep track of it otherwise you will not receive credit for doing them. This wastes a lot of time meanwhile you have several other tasks that you can be spending this valuable time on. Upper management has a target goal for you to reach, 100% of workload. They also say that it is not possible to hit 100%. What? How can I not hit 100% even if I am working as hard as I can? If you do hit 100% or close to it, they will adjust what they are expecting from you.

Employee's
- Other team's are very lazy to help you out, but if they want some help they will not hesitate to ask.

Compensation
- There is 2 bonuses in the year depending on if you receive them (January/July) and 1 raise (July). It is not a guarantee that you will receive a bonus and or raise. If you are working in the service department do not expect a raise higher than 1 - 3%. Earning less than 40k a year this will come out to $400-$1200 at best.

Opportunities at ASUS
- Very low possibility of career growth at ASUS. If you work here for 2-3 years you might be able to move up to the manager of your direct team. After this step you will be unable to move any higher you can only move to another team.

ASUS Fremont Facility
- Not very clean. Rats are known to be an issue here so do not put any type of snack or bars in your drawers. A few snakes were found in the warehouse as well.

Human Resources
- Will watch you when you go on your break and report you to your manager. I requested PTO one day to leave at 4:30 and my manager was not here. HR sent my manager an email saying I left early. Can't HR check the system before reporting to management?"

- Old Building
Nothing that exciting about the building, its not the worst either, but considering the size of the company, the facility should be larger and nicer 

- Lack of training
Our training process for each position is sparse at best, its definitely a sink or swim mentality, be better to have more structure in learning the specific roles and creating a shared database for referencing job functions and how to use the internal systems, left to your own devices much of the time, which builds your personally but hurts synergy"

Low salary so mostly new grads are hired and management does not know how or does not have time to train them. Employees who have been there for a long time basically have to lead by example, or new employees have to make mistakes before learning how to deal with issues. Therefore there is a feeling of always falling behind and never catching up. Management makes it difficult to resolve any problems or put any processes in place to stop the issues from continuing. The departments have a very ""us vs. them"" mentality as someone else had mentioned; thus there is no interdepartmental team work and lots of finger pointing.

Vending machines are over priced but thanks for having them because the food places aren't close enough to walk. Overall just need for managers to show more compassion to their employees and provide better assistance with workload.

ASUS,1.0,"Jan 1, 2019",ASUS: In Search Of Disposable Labor,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Fremont, CA","The health care, vision, and retirement benefits are good. Then you realize they just barely cover California's basic guidelines for company provided health care (good luck trying to cover your spouses and dependents). Also, you'll be using your PTO to go to the doctor since the company has no sick days. As far as other positives, there are water machines, overpriced vending machines, and the new building on Kato Road is miles ahead of where they used to be in Fremont. If you're lucky, you can also bond with other unfortunate people who are stuck in the company for personal reasons and make your daily work week more bearable. That or you speak Mandarin.","If you read other reviews, the key takeaway is that the company has poor management and the culture is super Taiwan focused (salary position, mandatory overtime daily with no pay, expectations to put work ahead of personal life, favors Mandarin speakers). If you do decide to ignore those warnings, be prepared for more hurdles. From personal anecdotes, the probationary period was basically no personal training on how to understand basic job functions and to struggle with tasks so you learn how to ""ask for help"" and get used to kissing up to upper management. When you ask basic questions as to why things in the department are run this way, you get answers like ""it's Asus"" or ""that's how I was taught."" When you do get accustomed to the ""it's Asus"" life, you have few options: 1) brown nose to upper management to create a promotion, 2) do as your told and stick to a miserable life at Asus, or 3) leave the company for greener pastures. Regardless of what you chose, if you stay at Asus, you will realize in the long run that HQ controls everything, management only sees you as a metric to their reports to HQ, and your direct manager will let you know you are replaceable should you decide to speak up. I've tried to combat the silly, archaic system for a while only to be told that ""California is an at-will employment state"" and I had other options available to me (basically be fired). Meanwhile all the suck ups to upper management who used to work in Best Buy retail get promoted and establishing a very high school-esque social group and a toxic work environment,  all the while you're trying to prove to HQ why a laptopmag review of Asus products are low compared to big players like Apple, Dell, and HP (hint: your product quality  and support is terrible)."
ASUS,1.0,"Jun 21, 2015",Interviewees Beware!,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Fremont, CA","You get to learn a variety of different skills and handle every aspect of your programs, accounts and campaigns. This means that you're going to gain experience in almost every aspect of the business - from budgeting, events, account management, marketing strategies and product knowledge. Keep in mind that these aren't just things you're getting exposure to, but responsibilities you are expected to maintain.","Travel - per diem = $35/day - you are expected to use your own finances to cover the costs with no guarantee of reimbursement. Also, if you are traveling on the weekends, doing events or meeting with customers, you are not compensated for this extra time you're working. You're also expected to maintain your normal work responsibilities even if you put in 16-18 hour day. 

Management - Flat organization with the President personally involved in your projects accounts and campaigns. Super Micro-managed company culture. 

Benefits - Recently removed tuition reimbursement program, comp days for exceptional performance, and work from home privileges. Health insurance benefits are okay but there are no other perks to working here. No on-site food other than a vending machine; cafeteria contains about 10 microwaves for you to heat your own food and looking for coffee, tea or juice? forget it. You bring your own. The gym is pathetic with 1 treadmill, 1 bike, and 1 elliptical, ping-pong tables and random weights. 

Company culture - 90% Asian. Love you guys, but I'd like to know what you're talking about in meetings. It's also very challenging to communicate because emails are very difficult to decipher. Company work ethic requires you to work overtime - in fact you probably won't get all your work done if you're not putting in at least 2-3 hours of overtime per day, And if you leave on time, it is noticed by everyone. Hours are not flexible."

ASUS,1.0,"Jun 30, 2019",One of the worst places to work for in the Bay Area,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,,Small gym & free coffee,"If all you cared about was having a small gym and free mediocre coffee, then this is the place for you. But if you cared about a company that valued its people, had a great company culture with healthy and supportive team environment, plus helpful managers who would want you to succeed and move up professionally by providing lots of opportunities for growth, or, gave back to the communities by giving time off to volunteer, and provided a work/life balance with flexible work schedule and the ability to work from home,(there’s plenty more to add here but you get the idea), then this isn’t the place for you. 

I did not adhere to the wise advice of those before me and warned about the low wages, expected long hours (if you’re on salary but will ding you for working over for hourly employees), micro managing, favoritism, high-school like cliques, no raises/bonuses for veteran employees, very Chinese/Taiwanese culture, and no perks. It’s almost unheard of that they let you get off early before the holidays. You’re lucky if they let you leave by 5:45pm the day before Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve or NYE, as you know, they are family holidays! To them, 6pm is when you need to leave work or later is better. Anytime before that, you gotta put in PTO for the missing time. A real Scrooge maybe?

High turn over and the highest exodus I’ve seen in any company that was not due to layoffs. It’s almost as if it’s a race now of who can get out of there quicker. I’ve even seen some walked out without giving any notices. Again, favoritism is blatant. Low wages and you only get bonuses or raises if they like you. Some in their 10+ years haven’t gotten a raise of more than 50 cents!! They see employees not as assets but as liabilities. There’s no trust and it’s evident by the mandatory monitoring where you record what you do every minute with a timer. It’s a literal timer on the web that you log on and press start as soon as you get in. They tell you it’s how they can measure what projects we’re working on. Except the fact that the majority of people don’t have multiple projects they work on and secondly, there are no separate budgets for these projects to measure where the hours or work go into. So really, there’s no function of the timer other than to monitor us: what time you get in, what time you leave, how long you take breaks and how much work you do.

It’s funny to read comments by management here that says “you have to love your job to enjoy it” and “you have to love and believe what you do.” Is that best pitch they can give to bring up enthusiasm? Anyone inspired now? But there you have it. I guess a lot of us did not love or believe in a company who does not value its employees."
ASUS,1.0,"Jul 9, 2014",Just a job not a career,Analyst,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Fremont, CA","Stable employment -  Unless you are terrible at your job, you will not get fired.  

Teammates - For the most part, the people on any team are easy to get along with, however it does create a strong ""Us vs Them"" dynamic which is an issue.

Work Life - Full benefits for regular employees.  Able to take time off as needed.  You will not be fired for taking time off.

Products - If you can get hands of a new product, its pretty fun to play with before anyone else is able to.","Training - Learn as you go approach.  No real training but preexisting habits you have to maintain for some reason.

Income - Not up to industry standards.  Bonus entirely depends on your manager.  Raises come very sparsely and in low volume.

Personal Growth - Limited mobility unless you have technical skills.  Nominal funding for higher education.  

Work - Entirely depends on your manager.  Some require daily updates on what you do daily, some don't.  Some people have meetings and high workload, others don't.  Your manager has a vague idea of what they want you to do, then you're pretty much stuck there whether it is good or bad.

Work Life - High stress.  Lots of products coming out, but no additional support to help, so a very strong 'do more with less' culture.  Too many conflicting opinions coming from management and HQ.  Very low communication between teams and management.  High attrition and turnover rate.  Company is very frugal in terms of spending for employee comforts and technology upgrades.  

Culture - No one openly discusses the difference in cultures that exist here.  There is a huge discrepancy between Asian and non-Asian lifestyles and its just assumed everyone can merge between the two easily."

It has been ranked as a great place to work and on the fortune 500, similar to other top decent organisations, but unfortunately, all those rankings are bogus and don't reflect that at all. A decent organisation that lay off its employees should be a great place to work, and fortune 500 of how they treat people when they let go. I have worked for similar organisations before and was laid off previously by other organisations. They have paid vacation pay, generous severance pay, and cash pay for cobra, and if you get a bonus, they will give you a suitable amount to reimburse for the bonus.
At Logicalis, I haven't got any of that, and the severance pay they offered was rubbish and stingy. Termination of unemployment is never a favourable decision to any employee, but decent organisations would not leave employees suffering. I have reached out to Management to revise severance but they don't care and they just replied with a standard rubbish email. The summary here is if you stay at Logicalis because they are stable, then that's not the case anymore, and if you are offered employment at Logicalis vs other organisation, then you better choose others.

The work life balance is tremendous with the ability to work remotely for some positions when needed.  Benefits are also very competitive.    

The technical resources from both a support and pre/post sales perspective are some of the best I have ever seen.

The new leadership in place is just that, leadership, which may have been missing in some key areas in the past.

They are friendly and don't micro-manage.  I did see a previous review mention that communication was lacking and promotions were hard to come by.  I'm not sure where that came from because the Service Desk currently has monthly 1on1 sessions, an agent led performance improvement team and monthly team lunches with agents and management.  There has also been over 15 people that have been promoted from the Service Desk to our Managed Services division in just the past year or so.  I'm happy with the opportunities and management team and work hard each day so I can earn my opportunities.

Although the company is trying to implement a career development strategy for its employees, I've seen all talk and very little action.  There is very little chance of advancement here, so you're best to move on after a few years.  Your personal career development is only as effective as the manager you work for.  If you work for someone who resists change, doesn't like to be challenged, and is a fan of doing things ""the way it's always been done"" (which is the current mindset of most mid-level managers here), then you are doomed to fail.

They talk a good game but It's all just smoke and mirrors.  Another review made a joke about cannibalism, but it's actually pretty sad to see how they devour people here.  I would bet that all of the positive reviews have been written by the HR staff.  They are overstaffed in that department and have plenty of time on their hands, let's face it.  My best advice is to run far away from this nightmare, if you have any self respect or pride.  I stuck it out for a very long time hoping that things would change for the better but they did not.  The executive team will back their management staff to the bitter end.  Bullying and harassment are common and also tolerated.  If you dare to make a mistake, however large/small or correctable, you will be raked over the coals for it but your manager will take zero accountability, they will even throw their own employees under the bus.  So much for a culture of teamwork, it does not exist."

If you have or are planing on getting your A+ certification, this is a really good place to get your experience because you will be handling issues that will allow you to use your A+  and grow your tech skills. That is not the case everywhere. The pay starts at $15 an hour. It's better than most helpdesk positions where the pay begins at $13.00 an hour. You do have to pay for your benefits. The health Insurance is pretty good. If you are looking to move up in the tech world, there is a Network Operating Center with Network Administrators, System Administrators and Server Administrators. The company likes to have a monthly birthday celebration where the provide cake and ice cream. There is also a sales meeting every three months where they give you free pizza. They really like to feed you here. There is also a free pop machine. They give put out free fruit every Tuesday. They also give away free Tiger tickets once a year even though the seats (and the team) aren't very good. The people are pretty friendly. If you are a tech, anime, video-game, PC nerd then you will fit in here. I'm not trying to be condescending when I type that. The Helpdesk Operations Manager is fair but he does hold everyone to a high standard. If you do your job and keep good attendance, you won't have to much to worry about.  This place is growing as well. They continue to get contracts and the team leaders will stand up for you if a customer gets rude. I've also seen quite a few people get promoted to technical and managerial roles. They have a award here call ""Rock Of The Service Desk"". If you win, you get to have dinner with the CEO, the buy you a prize and you get promoted. They monthly drawings for perfect attendance. If you win, you get an hour of free PTO or a parking pass to the underground garage. Its's not glamorous but it is there way of showing you they do notice you.","There are too many manager. There are about eight of them here. Luckily each manager has their projects that they look out for. However, I really think it could be more efficient if they had team leaders for each contract. 

The dental benefits are trash. They are cheap but not very good. You get one free cleaning per six months and the co-pays are expensive once the work gets gone. I got a root canal in March and that sucked up my entire insurance for the year. I did not know that dental insurance had a cap before I started here. 

They promote form within but once you get chosen it can take over a month to get to your position. I guess that there is this policy that promotions can only be done on the 1st of every month which causes the NOC to hire from the outside. It's just a faster process. 

The raises are not very good. I think it is something along the line of 38 cents after the first year. 

you get a lot of vacation time but you have to complete with everybody on the desk instead of just the people you work with on whatever contract you are on. Good luck with trying to get a day off on a Friday. 

You don't get holiday pay for all federal holidays.

No tuition reimbursement. 

The temperature control in this building is bad. Its always too hot or too cold. 

People have had their lunch stolen. Seriously

The managers don't do any evaluations so it is hard to get feedback on your performance. 

If you can, get a nightshift because there are no mangers around to hawk you. They sometimes like to micro-manage."

Logicalis,2.0,"Jul 7, 2020",Expectations and job function changed drastically,Service Desk Technician,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Tempe, AZ",Some of the co-workers were decent to be around,"When I started working for Logicalis, I was explicitly told that we would be supporting one company and fully integrate with their systems. However, within a few months, they added 2 more companies to support fully (this means learning new protocols and proprietary software for each company). By the end of my employment with them, they were about to add a 4th company to the roster

The worst, however, was management's obsession with the appearance of working. I was fairly consistently in the top 5 reps (out of about 30 people) at the time, yet I could barely turn to talk to a coworker without management asking what I was up to. The last straw for me was when they required phones to be put away during your shift and started SCHEDULING bathroom breaks. That is simply disrespectful, especially for those who are doing a good job.

Being Bilingual made my (and my bilingual coworkers') life more difficult as well. I had an extra call queue to handle as well as taking any spanish ticket that came in.

Also, because they hired many unqualified (and frankly immature) reps, that meant that callouts were literally a DAILY issue. I got the ""..can you come in to cover for *** who called in sick?"" call at least twice a week. 

Tickets are not dispatched, but rather everyone is expected to grab tickets AND calls as they come in. This makes it to where a few top dogs end up carrying the load of picking up tickets to avoid the whole team getting yelled at. 
Management is the typical stick-up-the-ass type repeating corporate policies as if biblical truths. There are no real incentives to be a good employee here other than personal ethics.

All in all the micromanagement, co-workers not pulling their weight, and being treated like a prisoner who can't get up to pee made this job too much for me. The job itself was really not that bad."
Logicalis,2.0,"Apr 24, 2012",Poor handling of talented staff- do your homework before you work there,Solutions Architect,Former Employee,"Irvine, CA",The people that work there are talented and driven. Pay is commensurate of skills and well applied. Services and product are valuable. Very good marketing department.,"The company manament fails to display nusiness maturity. There is no consistency in product to market management. The intellectual property lives in the head of management. The suite of products could be better and better documented. Follow-through from management is not there. There is no vision just a focus on revenue and margin. As a result a lot of talented people have been laid off so that the business financial outlook be saved in the view of the parent company. They also make promises to prospective talent that they fail to keep. The top three people in the company are setting the culture and it is not developing to be a good one, which is a shame because the people under it have what it takes to make Logicalis one of the best emerging leaders in their market by the fact that they bring amazing credibility to the company."
Logicalis,2.0,"Oct 3, 2012",Joke of a company,Finance,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Farmington Hills, MI",You get a laptop and good vacation time.,"Managers here are mostly a joke. Not all, but mine was a micro manager. Told me I need to start emailing her when I use the restroom? wtf. That was the last straw for me. Why is this stuff allowed by HR. That's another thing, HR is not there to regulate anything like this. Manager's can come up with whatever stupid rule they want for the department, even if unethical and it's all just ok. They play games. Manager's do not treat a top perfomer as a benefit to the department or company, I'm sure they're feeling regret about that right now! HR needs to step up and make rules and regulations company-wide. And train Manager's to know how to be a Manager so I don't have to do it. Here, if your manager thinks it's a good idea, then that's law and your manager can make up stupid rules and you basically have to follow them and like it or get lost. Go to a real company. Does Datatech even knew what goes on here? Things such as internal controls? Hello! Public Company! Where are they? So much passive agressive bs going on here all the time. The controller is educated and smart, but at the same time very dense. Get it together. Then they promote and make people manager that have ZERO people skills. Or you request pto time and get in trouble for it... or get told not to take any pto time for a while. Um, you can't give people pto days and then get mad when they use them and start a problem when there isn't one. There was this one manager that never even talked to her employee.... wow great idea. The Leadership here disgusts me."

Strong focus on the sales organization","Little/No career progression
Focus on organizations other than sales is mediocre 
Internal incentive programs are demotivating
Recognition, outside the sales arena, is poor
Training opportunities are lackluster; internal training portal is so confusing that navigating it should count as college credit
Leadership in silos; focuses on tactical or personal agendas instead of strategic development 
Middle/Lower management lacks focus in aligning strategy to tactics, spends more time in reactive mode instead of proactive mode
Lack of management cohesiveness across the layers makes it as if you are working for multiple companies
Communication is not utilized effectively
Delivery teams highly overworked
Resource limitations abound
Teamwork is nonexistent 
Visibility and understanding of organizational matrix is poor leading to duplication of effort and inefficiency
Work/Life balance is poor
Back office processes are confusing, inconsistent, and difficult to utilize
High turnover makes customer interactions more stressful
Corporate culture does not create a positive atmosphere, focuses on placing blame first and de-emphasizes root cause analysis
Organizational maturity is low

Policies and procedures are inconsistent, utilized arbitrarily and when questioned become supplemented with additional process.  The sheer pain from knowing that your attempt to improve things will end up with additional procedural overhead prevents all by the most sadistic from striving for improvement.  Will a system designed by sadists will promote corporate excellence?

Current toolsets are out-of-date, out-of-touch, and instead of doing at least one thing well, does many things poorly.   Great emphasis is directed at presentations, demonstrations, etc.  But, zero thought is given to the tools, infrastructure, and delivery.   Would you buy your technology solution from a company when the sales rep is doing a BYOD demo on a Hello Kitty phone? 

Organizational methodology is weakly coupled and when combined with the communications issues, silos, and general culture creates an atmosphere where accomplishing anything easy is difficult and anything difficult impossible.  This is unfortunate because I remember a time when our delivery teams did the impossible with a panache that defined the brand."
Logicalis,3.0,"Nov 10, 2015",Logicalis Review,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,,"It was generally easy to take PTO when needed. When you work in the call center, there are a bunch of different clients, so the opportunity to learn a lot of different technologies exists.","For the call center, I would say pay was below average, especially since raises were a very rare thing. Overtime and weekends are often mandatory, and a holiday or two is usually thrown in as well (the call center operates 24x7x365). Not a lot of chances to move beyond the call center, if that is where you are starting. Benefits were also above the industry standard and coverage wasn't great."
Logicalis,3.0,"Jan 7, 2020","Great people, those great people also leaving",Sales Support,Current Employee,,"I have met the best people working at Logicalis. Honest, smart, dedicated and a true teammates in every sense of the word. 30 days PTO, great benefits, flexible depending on what position you have.","The culture of Logicalis has changed in my tenure here. Upper management is so desperate to make numbers, the amount of micromanagement and pressure that comes down from the top is unbelievable. The new president is a tyrant in every sense of the word. This company lacks direction. Every year we have a new charge to follow, a new strategy to adhere to. They change their minds so much, we don’t know our heads from our rear ends. Upper management has grand ideas and strategies for the future, however changes are made before the resources are in place to implement those changes. Very little thought to how these grand ideas affect the employees, the business and the customers.
The ground level is left to clean up the mess.  The pay stinks and they will “promote” you with extra work and title, but not compensate you.  When a manager tells
you to to change companies to make more money, that is telling. Oh, and the real great people in the company...they tend to fire and replace with inferior management. I once was happy but now struggle to find my peace among the chaos. Good people are dropping like flies and that is really telling. There are much better places to land."

Quarterly layoffs and reorganizations indicate that the Leadership Team (LT) keeps trying things that don't work. Somehow, people manage to get their jobs done in spite of this.

The LT conducted a focus team for the survey with the intent to get more good survey responses. The focus team was told at the outset not to bother evaluating any questions that were LT related, just make suggestions for what people at our level could do to help. Management also had a shadow team who the original focus team was unaware of, that filtered the suggestions made so not to offend the LT. 

Upper level executives keep disappearing from the company, but the ones who need to go are still there at the highest levels. 

The car consortium who owns the company had promised not to interfere in our daily operations when they bought the company, but they are always interferring. I have heard in meetings many times that we have to stop what we are doing and work on something for one of the owners.

 Getting promoted from within is nearly impossible. Make sure if you accept a job here, you get the salary you want and you are hired in at the level you want to be at 5 years from now. Then at the end of 5 years, you may be ok."

Management had the bright idea of combining support I and support II positions into one single position. This means you take the interactions, document the cases, and close every single case. Cases that should go to more experienced team members are now your responsibility. You WILL have to be in contact with analysts and customers until the issue is resolved. Most managers have NO IDEA how to help you because they were hired from lateral positions in different companies, they just hold the title and go to meetings all day. This means, you WILL be trapped under a pile of unresolved cases because you are expected to close 15+ cases per day but an interaction can range from 5 minutes to 1+ hour. It’s like management wants you to fail. On top of this, during “tax season” you will have MANDATORY overtime. Your kids, spouse, family emergency… will have to wait because there is MANDATORY overtime. Your manager will have a word with you if you fail to comply to their terms. They 100% expect you to keep taking calls no matter what. They will lie and say they don’t micromanage and only “keep track to make sure you are getting the right help” but here is a list of the things they will track and record: Your calls, your chats, your status, your computer screen, your keyboard, your mouse clicks, your open cases, your closed cases, amount of time spent talking to customers, amount of time spent not talking to customers, amount time going to a personal break, and amount of time working on open cases. No micromanaging here though according to management.

You will be working over 40 hours nearly every week (including weekends). Every 2 weeks you will meet with your manager who will break down every thing and point out your deficiencies. 

Please do not work here and take care of your mental health. This job will squeeze the joy out of your life. Waking up to talk to rude customers is not a way to live.

Forget moving up here too. It will take years and if you’re not brown nosing, you have no chance."

They claim there job is accounting based but it is not and no one will hire you as your QA is very specific Depending on who your supervisor is you will not get trained and then when things go wrong they will throw you under the bus for it (even if you have asked to be trained multiple times) Some people have been there for so long they will refuse to train people in key functions of the role so they have job security Too many meetings CEO brags about profits but refuses to pay more Their idea of a yearly bonus is a hoodie They will have parties that serve lobster and steak because a big wig will be there but not care that their employees are struggling to pay rent Work here if you just want to struggle the rest of your life"

No real strategic thinking - keeping the lights on is a full-time job.
No growth and steep declines in recent years since HPE acquisition. Company was doing well until that happened and has never recovered and not sure it ever will. 
Shuffled leadership and created many ""task forces"" and ""growth offices"" with redundant responsibilities.
Oodles of consultants that have yet to add value.
Added some new faces but they seem to be drug down by legacy players.
Continues to hemorrhage A-team talent primarily due to compensation - no material bonus payouts in years and next to no increases, stock has only declined precipitously
No plans to address attrition - attitude seams to be that if people leave on their own a RIF will not be needed.
Leadership seems to be either ""out of their league"" or so mired in legacy HPE thinking that no one has good ideas on how to realistically grow or stop the bleeding.

Too much focus on lengthy product training vs sales execution 
Highly complex comp plan and thus there are many conflicts over comp payouts and timing

There was a clear vision provided from marketing leadership and we consistently charted our progress against key KPIs. I learned a lot from both peers and leaders at a pivotal juncture in my career. I was enamored by Twilio's commitment to being an anti-racist company, the Twilio magic principles, and of working in an environment of positivity. I left the company in early 2022 for an opportunity that I just couldn't decline (more responsibility, solving interesting problems, better benefits and compensation). I feel lucky to have left the company when I did, as I missed the mass layoffs and culture decline.","To put it bluntly, leadership has issues. This is true in marketing and org-wide. Since the hire of the new CMO, VP leadership in marketing have departed the company one by one—a telltale sign of a lack of faith of leadership's competence and the in the direction Twilio is headed in.

While not a direct result of internal salary adjustments, this shift reflects the current competitive landscape in the tech industry, positioning Twilio's compensation packages within the average range.","Executive compensation appears misaligned with the company's financial performance. For example, the CEO's salary is notably higher than that of the CEO of Disney, a significantly more valuable and profitable company, raising questions about the appropriateness of such compensation amidst the company's financial challenges.

There has been a noticeable turnover in staff quality and efficiency. High-performing individuals ('A players') have largely departed, and the current team composition poses challenges to rapid and effective cross-functional collaboration.

The company culture has shifted towards a more political environment, particularly at the Director level and above. This shift often results in decisions that prioritize short-term gains or personal agendas over long-term company benefits, such as the underutilization of costly tools despite expert recommendations.

There's a tendency to view team underperformance as an issue with individual contributors rather than a reflection of leadership effectiveness. This perspective is contributing to a culture where systemic issues are not adequately addressed.

Management style has increasingly favored political maneuvering over strategic competence. A notable number of managers lack a deep understanding of the strategies and tactics pertinent to their functions, which, coupled with poor decision-making, has had a significant cost impact on the business."

There is no rhyme or reason to who is laid off, it doesn't matter how long they have been with the company, if they are a top performer or not, they are just released.

My experience with a great manager made my experience more positive than many of my colleagues'.,"Lack of manager training and accountability and shortage of HRBP availability makes for very uneven quality of middle management.

Unfortunately, the enthusiasm of many of these employees drained over the last year in light of faltering leadership (see cons). Work/life balance was fantastic, with remote work opportunities and unlimited PTO.","Management at all levels is a disaster. The leadership changes direction so regularly that it is difficult for teams to achieve their goals. Not only is this frustrating, but over time the cumulative impact of projects repeatedly being discarded is a huge hit to morale. Team and departmental management lacked the skills needed to motivate and grow their employees; in my 2 years at Twilio I was rarely provided with any practical leadership or professional development opportunities despite asking for them. Despite their stated commitment to diversity and inclusion, my experience was that men were regularly favored over women in terms of promotions, leadership opportunities, stretch assignments, and access to their skip-level managers. The majority of their stated anti-racist layoffs, at least on my team, consisted of women, people of color, and people with disabilities. It is my opinion that the DEI team that was established is just for optics; my team regularly interacted with them and they had a reputation for using intimidation and bullying tactics to achieve their goals - completely counteractive to how a DEI team should behave."

Company is going through growing pains and is trying to iron out business goals and objectives to get to the next level.

Constantly shifting priorities, infighting, politics, lack of vision, low levels of technical understanding, all blanketed with a lack of awareness of these weaknesses. The company was oriented around growth and when that suddenly stopped being the focus, ended up destroying its culture to try to adapt to the changing market.

The company takes personal growth and development seriously. I've never seen a company allow you to train and expand your professional skills on company dime and time. It's amazing. The compensation is on par or above what a designer at this level would make in house or at an agency. The benefits are decent, Healthcare offerings could be improved. Specifically dental, there's only one option. Unlimited PTO is great, there's a good culture on my team that encourages folks to take off. Overall this a relatively low stress environment for a designer who is okay with having a clock-in, collect, repeat mentality. You won't make the most groundbreaking work but it's a comfortable place to grow and look towards the future.","In the field of design, Twilio is a place like many others. You probably won't move up until somebody leaves. It's top heavy with several mid-senior level designers and art directors. The title structure makes growth feel like an unnecessarily long venture. Example - there are 3 steps of visual design positions before you could become a Senior designer. This trend continues up the ladder. You're designing for a pretty niche audience and the subject matter is dense. It's challenging to understand who you're designing for. Probably best suited for designers that also have an interest in programming although it's not required and you could do the job without knowing any coding languages."

Even the CEO will tell you, “We are Developer First,” meaning they still haven’t figured out to care and cultivate their sales org. There is no sense of direction especially when it comes to sales and generating revenue, even though obtaining profitability at all costs is the goal. So why lay off a ton of top performers just to appear “fair” if generating revenue is so important?! You’re not really selling here either, you’re promoting platform consumption and cheerleading to developers to use the platform. You do more account management then prospect. The comp plan is the most confusing on the market as well. It should of have been a red flag when I asked ten different people to explain the comp plan and got ten different answers. Even if you’re over performing, you are at risk of being cut if they don’t achieve their financial goals every quarter."

Sprinklr,2.0,"Dec 15, 2023",Absolutely Atrocious Sales Management,Enterprise Account Executive,Former Employee,"Denver, CO",Co-Workers were great people and talented sales reps,"- Culture of micromanagement. Sales management at Sprinklr has no idea how to run a proper sales organization and they try to make up for it by attempting to control every aspect of the sales cycle. This in turn creates a massive bottle neck where reps do not have their own autonomy and require management involvement to simply call a customer. Your manager will want to be on every call, every email, maintain access to your call notes and will want them all in the format of their choosing; which they will change on a whim.

- 95% of reps here will not make any money. The quotas are set high and the territory is thin. Most people make their base salary.

- The company grew quickly due to a low rate environment and went public. Due to this they have people who were SDRs when it was a startup, who are now attempting to manage seasoned sales reps. This leads to insecurity in management, who will tear down their reps to avoid the perception of inexperience.

- The company doesn't know what it wants to be. Although public, the company can't decide if it's a marketing tool, a customer care tool, or an advertising platform. All of Sprinklr's competitors have decided what they are and cost less. The product is not a need to have for most companies.

- Culture of playing favorites. Managers frequently pick and choose who gets which accounts based on who they like. Promotions are also decided this way."

They completely undersold the KPIs and the nature of the work because my background is account management but it was solely and outbound position which I told them I did not want but they assured me I would have plenty of customer facing opportunities and would be leading calls / qualifying needs which was not true. Ive kept up on LI with former colleagues and in my department roughly 50% of people have moved on sooner than a year which I think is telling. If you are willing to grind out an organization that changes every month and still has plenty of kinks to figure out, this is the place for you if you want that start up feel."

This is a place where careers go to die.","Sprinklr suffers from chronic leadership turnover and it all seems to come from the top. The CEO is a great visionary but he lacks trust in his senior leadership team and begins to take over their jobs and responsibilities.

Sprinklr,4.0,"Sep 25, 2022",Overall Great - Few Key Areas Need Improvement,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Austin, TX","Base salary is very competitive in tech sales (Austin based) - variable comp is less than some of the %'s I've seen elsewhere, but higher base comp is always preferable in my opinion to account for the ups and downs of B2B sales.

Most amazing product ever - incredibly impactful on the market. The opportunity to sell to the literal biggest brands on planet Earth is very fun. This comes with a need for strategic, highly personalized outreach that is a very cool challenge to approach every day.

Lots of PG freedom, as long as your numbers are decent and you're putting in effort, the channel and method of outreach are always flexible, SDRs are mostly allowed to do what works for us. Now if you're struggling that becomes a different story, but that is the way of sales everywhere.

Very supportive community - since SDRs have their own territory and specified accounts to work on, there is a minimal amount of strategy guarding or gatekeeping. For the most part, everyone wants to help each other out, all managers are very willing to help people from other teams with whatever is needed.

Incredible office space that is under-utilized. If you get a job as an SDR here (which I recommend) use the office space! Free lunch 2 days per week, tons of snacks/drinks on site, many many desk spaces which are never full, game room, weight room / locker room, a bunch of soundproof call boxes / meeting rooms, etc. Really makes coming in to work a lot more fun in my experience.","Quota is pretty high, most will not be able to hit it consistently without some luck going their way or being placed in one of the best geographic regions. However, management realizes this and will work with you if you are putting in the effort to improve - this isn't a ""miss quota twice and you're fired"" type of place, its about the value you are providing as a whole and how hard you're trying.

Benefits are very difficult to understand - when signing up, the UI is not good and afterwards its a struggle to find the exact details of different health plans / how to change them. Also ""Unlimited PTO"" is a nice dream but don't expect to be taking 3+ days off every month - metric requirements are definitely high and you have to work hard every week to hit them. PTO still has to be approved in advance by management, and it will be denied if you aren't getting close on activity metrics. However, managers are very flexible and will 100% work with you when things come up.

Product is extremely complex - pro and a con because having so many different features allows you to sell to 75% of titles out there which is very nice because prospecting is limitless, but completely understanding the product and how to pitch it intricately can take 6+ months. Nonetheless, its a really cool product that makes it feel like what you're selling actually matters - its becoming a staple of Enterprise tech stacks.

Company has exported a lot of jobs to India including tons of marketing roles, makes up a huge % of the company - makes things pretty siloed at times, along with time / cultural / language differences putting a strain on communications and content / campaign development. Currently there is limited marketing support for Sales. SDRs mostly just stick within their own teams, but collaborating across is difficult when necessary.

Confused transitions happening within leadership right now due to a few key leaders leaving. It's also very tough to transition between departments currently, several SDRs have been blocked from moving to solutions or customer success even after being approved initially due to a hiring freeze. Should be lifted relatively soon - prior to the freeze, moving departments was encouraged and pretty seamless.

Major tech stack changes currently being implemented (likely to cut costs) that are a big step back in my opinion, will definitely impact employee user experience and internal productivity. Not one single person in the company that I've talked to is happy about it, many are dreading it as much as I am, our tech stack was near perfect before."

While most people at Sprinklr (including direct managers) will make an effort to befriend you or at minimum be nice, SLT does not. It seems that they have embraced the role of being the 'bad guy'.

The company has a simple way of seasoning consultants. They get pushed into high pressure situations, and they learn fast, and quickly start managing their own work. But they tend to be blind towards intricate details, especially in complicated IT product implementations. This has an interesting effect. If someone is able to do the hands-on work, everyone else tries to piggy-back on that person for their actual work.

Everything about this company is an absolute nightmare. After a mass exodus (which is still ongoing, by the way) on the design team, they have started ONLY hiring specifically entry level women POC. Everyone above your average product designer however, is not POC. You tell me what that means. 

Hint: Sprinklr will continue hiring junior POC talent while grossly underpaying and overworking them because more senior talent knows their worth. 

Design system? Research? Don't set the bar so high now, we don't even need to talk about that stuff when everything else is falling apart. 

Here's how it works:

Leadership will yell at you and lecture you about what they think UX is despite having absolutely no relevant experience in the field. You will do what they tell you, pixel by pixel, back and forth, constantly. I'm not even scratching the surface of what it's like...just know that it's bad.

Great experience for learning what a toxic work culture looks like. It can only go up from here I guess. Don't do it."

Sprinklr,3.0,"Apr 12, 2022",Growing into the Tech Norms,Professional Services,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","New York, NY","Team Culture
Coming from an Agency background into Tech, it was the first time having a team rooting for you to succeed. A part of this is understanding that it was a time of unprecedented growth and needing all help to succeed at scale. The other part was a homegrown culture of inclusiveness to foster belonging to a team. Wins and losses were recognized with transparency, then at the end of the day, we'll come together to tackle the next challenge. Honestly, it was the epitome of figuring it out as we go.

Great Technology Platform
The technology is enterprise ready. Though very complex, it is built to embed and scale within a company. Being able to reference across other technologies, I take my hat off on how impressive the technology is and what it can grow to be.","Company Culture
While internal team culture was a breath of fresh air, outside of that, there are some toxic relationships across departments. It isn't unheard of to have tension between departments, however it's more pronounced at Sprinklr. Hopefully this will get resolved, but at its current state, it seems like the departments are less cooperative (outside of C-Level mandates) to work cohesively together.

Engineering Answers ≠ Process of Execution
While the technology is great, the complexity creates its own challenges in implementation, training, and adoption. This means the delivery of actualized value needs careful design and know how, which aren't intuitive to our clients. To stay ahead of the market, the technology has added ""features"" as an answer to competitiveness, while leaving the compatibility and know how at the wayside.

Total Compensation Package
In my time, as I advanced in more senior roles, the compensation packages were ""okay"", however they are not as competitive in the market overall. As of now, there are growing needs to reduce costs, so I don't see this as getting better. In terms of perks, they are standard, but not stellar in relation to the industry.

Diversity Challenges
As with many tech and companies in general, there isn't a large diversity within leadership positions. While I have had the privilege to work with some amazing colleagues who were female or a person of color, there were few representatives in positions of leadership. This does drive culture and it does show across the various departments."

Sprinklr,2.0,"Aug 17, 2014",My experience has been more hype then substance,Regional Sales Manager,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Chicago, IL","Company has done a nice job creating a market ""leadership"" role in the marketplace.  
Base salary was extremely competitive with a big potential upside with quota.  
They were very aggressive in their recruiting, and did an amazing job on selling me on the company.","My review mostly applies to anyone looking to join in sales (especially outside of NYC).   
While the company appears to be growing quickly, they are covering up several issues.  I left a great company and job, because I thought Sprinklr was a rocket ship.  Unfortunately, that has not been my experience, and rocket ships can also crash. 
 
In six months, I haven't received any leads or assistance from marketing, existing customers aren't really happy in particularly because the product is very difficult to use even after long set up times (2-3 months to setup).  As a result, we are pushed to sell a lot of professional services to help customers succeed.  Therefore, while initially the compensation package was compelling, it will be extremely difficult to achieve under this environment since there are some smaller, newer competitors now winning business.  The recent acquisitions of agencies, shows the company is moving away from being a true product company and is an attempt to fill in the product deficiency. 

It appears the company did a good job locking a lot of customers into 2 - 3 year deals, and as those come up for renewal, I would suspect they start to see some real churn."
Sprinklr,2.0,"Jul 24, 2017",VCE management has destroyed the company and its culture,Regional Sales Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","New York, NY","* product is best-in-class
* social media management space is trendy/popular/sexy","* VCE management team (incl. Tim Page and his army) has severely damaged the company, its culture, and employee morale.   
* sales compensation plan is poor.  Definitely below-industry.  Top sales talent is not going to join with such a poor plan.
* Endless fire drills and last-minute requests to fill out ""emergency"" spreadsheets, docs, etc.   Feels like the entire business is running in panic mode 24/7.
* complete lack of marketing.   No CMO and it shows.   No simplicity in messaging/positioning, product briefs,  pricing, etc.    Field making up its own messaging and creating its own marketing materials.  
* massive hiring spree has dropped the quality of talent significantly.   Hiring managers were ordered recently to fill a very large number of positions in just weeks.   Not surprising that a focus on quantity (versus quality)  resulted in a decline in talent levels."

Sprinklr,1.0,"Jul 28, 2021",Pixel pushing feature factory,Product Designer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Portland, OR",The design team has a lot of great people that really care and are trying to do great work.,"The design team is relegated to churning out UI tasks handed over from Product, typically with minimal to zero requirements or research to back up the requests. Everything is high priority. There is no real roadmap or vision for the product, so requests ultimately end up being asks directly from [big client] with little regard to how they fit into the overall application. Forget about any strategic product thinking or collaboration as a designer. Design is completely reactive, usually bouncing from fire to fire. Exploration, wireframing, and prototyping are looked at as a waste of time, all designs start in high fidelity drawing from an out of date design system.

Design patterns and components change weekly, if not daily. Designers are constantly running around trying to find the ‘latest’ design. Design standards and rules are not established. Be prepared to constantly redo your designs to match the ‘latest’ from another designers design file. There is no source of truth library. 

Leadership micromanages everything. Direction changes day to day, seemingly on a whim. You'll end up designing in circles as you try to address contradictory feedback or input given with no context of the actual problem. And you'll be asked why it's taking so long. Feedback is given without any reasoning as to the why. Don’t expect to learn or grow here, as designers are left to fend for themselves in their own silos dealing with subjective feedback.

Every few weeks people are shuffled around and teams are rearranged to work on the suddenly new prioritized feature or to put out the fire of the week. Churn is increasing as all the talent is fleeing and moral has been scraping rock bottom for months. Processes are completely dysfunctional, bottle-necked, and inefficient. Leadership seems to have little interest in fixing anything.

Design managers are experienced and truly care, but are stuck is a difficult position trying to support and setup designers for success with no support from leadership. Any proposals to update or change anything regarding processes are met with roadblocks or stone walls. 

Look elsewhere if you're a designer that cares about quality and design thinking or cares to continue to grow and learn professionally."

2) Flexible work from home policy
3) Generous PTO

That's it.","Sprinklr has undergone many changes, including new senior management, in the past couple of years that have negatively impacted workplace culture. Career opportunities are dismal for entry-level employees unless you are part of the inner ""bro"" circle. Expect to work long hours and not get compensated accordingly, even after multiple stellar performance reviews. If you want support from HR you won't find it, they care about making sure their upper management isn't affected by employee complaints or ideas.  There have been multiple instances of Sprinklr not taking diversity seriously and not caring to expand their team for qualified candidates. Undergoing financial changes, multiple layoffs have begun. This place will ruin your career and your outlook on the tech industry because they do not care about their employees, they only care about money now."

Sprinklr,5.0,"Jul 13, 2015",I love Sprinklr!,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,"New York, NY","Work environment, culture, and values.  Not neglecting the technology/product here, it is absolutely robust, innovative, and amongst the highest rated in its class.  Having said that, people are what will elevate a company from great to elite.  The people I've collaborated with are the smartest and friendliest set of co workers I've had to date.  Everyone wants to succeed but realize you're only as strong as your weakest link.

The most exciting part is that this is a company in hyper growth, who is becoming more and more structured, yet retains the very foundations of it's start up culture (the degree can vary by office location as some offices are smaller than others).  You have the snack bars, catered lunches, equity, social outings, and beer in fridge.  Sprinklr creates for a very exciting yet professional workplace at the same time, where for the first time ever I can honestly say I enjoy going to work.

Our leaders are absolute visionaries, they've created something very special and unique.  The key is employing passionate people who share the same vision, and that's what you'll get in Sprinklr.","Again, they're trying to be more structured so only if you're not a self starter then that will be a huge con, as you will not be baby-fed anything in the beginning nor after.  401K match is also currently not on the table but that is something the company is looking into."

The wellbeing offerings are robust, cool, constantly evolving and never boring. Love the wellness platform and wellness speakers.","One must learn early on to manage their time and protect it by blocking time on the calendar. Given that this is a global company, people are working at all hours depending on where they are in the world. It is important to make sure not to burn out. But I think this applies to work at any global company. We all must individually learn to manage our time and protect it, while being productive."

Leadership who cares and will jump in and provide you guidance yet leave you to do what needs to be done, making sure you know you have ample resources and never have to go without help when you need it.

Brilliant minds all around you at all level - each with an open door policy who are willing to take the time to talk with you and hear your voice.

Compensation is fair and on-par with other companies.  Benefits are strong and there are a number of perks that any in-office or remote employees can enjoy.

Work/Life balance is amazing.  The CEO himself talks about how important it is to have a solid work/life balance.  Having the ability to take care of business - Doctor's appointments, Gym, etc. isn't a problem.

- Company hosts a training and brings in all new employees from across the world to NY for orientation/training (this is a recently implementation, so it's continuing to evolve and improve)
- Hiring/interview process was long, but they are excellent at keeping you up to date/following-up in a timely manner. They really want to make sure they're hiring people that are the right fit for the company and personify their values. Also, they genuinely work with you to find the right position that fits what you're interested in.","- Personally, I don't see this as a con, but you have to be a self-starter to work here, and want to learn as much as you can (aka be proactive and responsible for your own knowledge and success). Not an atmosphere for the lazy or those that want to mentally check out once they leave the office.
- Typical growing pains of a start-up (fast-paced, constant changes, constant platform updates, etc.). Again, not a really a con in my book, but can be for those who aren't interested in that type of environment."

So that when IBM raises their prices to Kyndryl, they try and pass it along to their customers even mid-contract with them. This causes a customer sat issue. Lots of sat issues. Not focusing on organic growth but only on the few profitable clients. Old time IBM management employees form a click and protect themselves at the cost of efficiency. There is a lot of people staying in roles where they should be shifted and moved around. Others are promoted prematurely based on old connections. Perhaps they will have a management RIF. Top leaders have exorbitant salaries while they rework the comp plan to focus on GP and reduce commissions to those who own the day to day relationships.

Their cybersecurity organization tries to control everything. The latest innovation: Tracking your violations against some made-up micromanagement policies like ""your can only use approved websites"". Each violation gets you a negative point and after a few you get an interview with HR.. I mean - don't they run these things by legal? In a multinational corporations you try to do things like this to your workforce? Regarding Azure.. To even request anything in azure you first need to build a perfect architecture and get it approved through processes that change constantly. And even if you get all the approvals you don't get a subscription (like in every other enterprise this size) but you get only the specific resource you asked for with very limited access to it - everyone who has ever touched azure will know where this goes.. stuff that took me 2 weeks at previous companies now takes 6 months and I don't even know if my resources still work tomorrow because someone decided to change the rules again.. in 8 years working with Azure I never had serious downtime issues.. here it's a weekly thing - I don't even know how you can get downtime in azure..??? Regarding Office365.. They restrict connectors in Power Automate.. so for each flow or power app you create you need to go through an approval process.. you want to use MS forms to get some answers quickly? Nope, you need to work through an 8 week approval process first, get a dedicated environment for it and then you are allowed to use it.. I wouldn't be surprised if they restrict excel formulas next.. (well they probably would if they'd know how to..) It's very sad since the company has great potential but this ancient culture of ""we want to do it as we always did"" and ""our colleagues are our enemies"" is really not fun. Especially if you are used to a modern workplace where cloud is normal it just feels like the dark ages here.. (remember 2014 when you needed to use your VPN to connect to a super slow jump host you share with 100 other people so you can get access to a server? yeah.. )"

Colleagues are respectful, polite and genuinely nice. That and good work-life balance are the reasons why people say Skyscanner has a good culture.

· Good work-life balance. There’s a lot of respect for personal boundaries and work-life balance. If you need time off for your physical health, mental health, or family reasons, everyone understands and encourages you to prioritise yourself and your family.

· Traveller-first approach. People care about the users, and put their needs above the needs of the business. It's a rare and admirable cultural trait for a company that big. 

· Mature product development process. Roadmaps, product hypotheses, success metrics, cross-functional collaboration and stakeholder management.","· People choose to be nice instead of being honest. That's the flip side of the company culture of niceness. People don’t give “negative” feedback and often avoid any type of confrontation. That gets in the way of getting honest work critique, improving product quality and trying to get career development feedback.

· Career progression is almost impossible. It's a bureaucratic, document-heavy, and unclear process. It takes years and almost impossible to do by the book. To get a promotion people focus not on delivering the work, but on visibility and building relationships to be in favour with the right people from the leadership.

· No vision. There is no ambition, no big bets, no ideas for what's next in travel tech. The leadership presents a few design concepts once a year, but they never get built. There are endless conversations to align on ideas and plans, and no one ever takes the responsibility for a decision.

· Hard to be proud of the product. Product across desktop website, mobile website, and mobile apps looks and works incoherently. Since the beginning of COVID many features were shut down, and never turned back on. In the last years very few new features were launched. If you compare Skyscanner's product with competitors, it's severely behind in quality and convenience.

Overall, Skyscanner is a great place to work if you value work-life balance, nice colleagues, and a good salary and benefits. However, if you are ambitious and want to do your best work, grow, and learn, it's not the best fit for you."

One of the main director in this space believes Scrum Masters are Managers so that says it all really. They're also tracking progress using 'Epic Cycle Time' as their main indicator of progress and they have a 40 page software delivery handbook that everyones forced to read when they join and if you ask questions you're immediately pointed back to the handbook. Basically, they've hired people in very senior roles who have very little experience, and everyones been there for a long time so they haven't seen what it's like in other companies. You will also get fired for having a different opinion or pointing out challenges even if it is part of your role as a coach. I wouldn't apply if you're an experienced Agile Coach would be my advise as you'll be flogging a dead horse and they also don't have a strategy either. They only hire people into the role that haven't had a lot of industry exposure so they can mould them to fit Skyscanner. They also over-hired during covid and are at a stuck point for the next 4-5 years in terms of hiring roles they need to address some of their core challenges.

(See below) I generally feel well cared for as an employee.","Hasn't quite mastered making innovation viable yet Since the pandemic, Skyscanner has re-focused the product development back to its core meta product. This means there isn't too much scope for any fresh, interesting projects for now. This could change in the future. The company has experimented with some innovative products in the past, but ultimately many of them have been eventually shelved. I have worked on several initiatives that were expensive and eventually turned out to be non-viable. This either because the business model was not viable, or the context of travel changed. Skyscanner could benefit by going back to its start up mindset, to test and learn faster. Management is a weakness There are a few really good managers, but their impact and contributions are not rewarded enough. I personally do not feel well managed, in terms of clear expectations being set or getting constructive feedback in a timely manner. It's a consensus across my team. Most employees are laser focused on their own career progression which can mean there is sometimes a competitive and non-cooperative vibe at times. The emphasis for career progression is on individual contributor work, which means the management focus is not quite there."

Akamai,1.0,"Dec 13, 2023",Male dominated workforce,Lead Cat Herder,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",,"Distance to office convenient, could work from home, good work, great relationships with customers and peers.","I worked well over 40 hours a week for Akamai. I busted myself to make Akamai look good, to do everything that I could to make my customers happy, because that made me happy. But I never got any credit for the amount of work that I put in to pick up the slack because people were dropping things left and right. But let a small mistake slip through the cracks because you are overworked, you are looked at like you are not worthy to be there. Management never took a look at the operations, even though concerns were raised, but instead they didn't like people raising concerns and honed in on the person raising concerns and in the end, the overworked person trying to fill the gaps is often the one punished. They never fixed and probably still to this day have not fixed the root cause. 

Certain people were on customer accounts that were not serving them well. I was hired to come in and help serve those accounts. I was subjected to several months of grueling training known as ""whiteboarding"" where you do several hours of really bad online training, work with a mentor, and then the people who are going to be your peers (or in my case whose work I would be taking on) test you. Now that sounds kind of strange right? The people with the bad attitudes, whose accounts were being neglected were doing the test proctoring? That is correct. So, if they knew that you would be taking some of their work, it seemed that they really liked sabotaging you. You are in a room with a whiteboard, a camera, there are people in the room, you have no notes, no references, and you have no idea what people are going to ask you. And there are people purposely try to rabbit hole you so that you bomb the presentation within minutes so that they can have a laugh. And it did happen. I had worked so hard on my presentation and how I was going to put it into my own words, thoughts, pictures, and had presented it to my mentor, who passed off on it, only to be bounced on a question that had nothing to do with what I had been presenting. The audience are in a notepad session where they are writing notes on you and each can see what the others are writing. I watched guys pass their training with flying colors. No hard questions. It was like the high five fist bump macho club. However, there was one guy who minutes into his presentation got rabbit holed and he said ""**Explicatory** it"" and sat down at the table. He gave up trying and eventually quit. 

As a female, you don't get invited to lunch with the bro club. Even if you work on the same accounts., which leads to things being discussed and you are out of the loop, just because you don't have the right chromosomes. 

I didn't get a raise for years and when I asked why, there were ""other people that were making less than me"" was the reason. So, no matter if I had a killer year, the customers loved me, and the slacker that was making less than me was still slacking, it didn't matter. Things needed to be equaled out according to management. 

You could take a class, and be reimbursed for it. However, if you missed the deadline in getting your receipt in, you couldn't get it, even with a good reason. And especially if you had a boss who wouldn't bat for you. Why is there a deadline anyway? I got an entire Masters degree paid for by an employer, including books, tuition, and even got a bonus after I completed it. Funny, I did that just fine over a period of 2 years, but took one little course at Akamai and couldn't get reimbursed for it. That is what you contend with when you have a boss that is not in your corner. It could have been reimbursed but they chose not to. 

To work there, you had to be a manly woman to get the respect of your team. Some women would actually lower their voices and act bro-like to get respect. People should be looked at and respected for who they are, not what they have in their pants. 

If I thought my old manager was bad, enter the new manager who was once my peer. He was in love with himself and loved to hear himself talk. Nobody could stand him. He only did what management told him, trampled on his teammates, when he made mistakes, he blamed others, and tried to take credit for so many things in order to get brownie points and they still wouldn't promote him. He had a penchant for always being right and arguing with everyone. Because they ran out of people to promote, he eventually got the management job and we all congratulated him. But eventually, he made my life so bad that I didn't even want to be at work any longer and I put in my 2 weeks notice. My peers and my customers were so confused as to why I was leaving. You have your customers sad that you are leaving, meanwhile your boss is ripping on you in 1:1 meetings, quizzing you on things that you had in training years before and passed and don't use in your day to day job. I tried to say something, but HR isn't your friend. They are looking out for the #1 and it's not you. When several people quit their jobs in a period of months, huge red flags should be going up."

And it's exciting to be part of an organization that is constantly reaching new heights. 
Here are some points that I would consider as Pros: 
1. Comprehensive training resources for new hires to ramp up the knowledge. You dont have to be an expert in database or cloud computing domain to join the company, as long as you are willing to take the challenge and keep learning. 
2. Consistent behavior exhibited by its leadership team, both internally and in public presence. 
3. MongoDB is relatively in smaller scale in my region, but it also means you will be granted more responsibilities to experience, and also experiment new process, new industry, new customers with strong support from internal teams.
4. Product-oriented approach and really care about the developer community and customer feedbacks.","1. Sometimes in daily work, you do have to play one-man bank to take care of different tasks that might not technically ""in-scope"" of your role.

There's a lack of emotional intelligence training, and communication seems belittling. It feels like a situation where individuals with inflated egos, akin to children, are managing the company. The dynamic suggests engineers and product teams dominate, while others are perceived as mere minions. Expressing new ideas is met with swift dismissal and sometimes negative labeling.

The technical program director appears unresponsive to feedback, sticking to outdated methods. Instead of fostering an open environment, she retaliates when confronted and lacks a strong engineering background.

This place was once pretty decent years ago, but even then it was a tough place to be from a culture and quota attainment perspective. If you’re a minority of any kind you will likely be the only one in the room if not one of a handful. Expect to be micro managed and work well over 50 hours a week if you want to be viewed as a good employee. Overly complex comp structure that only a small percentage of people actually hit. Lots of bad managers have ended up in middle management positions across sales, customer success, and sales dev. You cannot share feedback unless it’s positive but you have to subject yourself to feedback of any kind at all times. Sales org is a walking HR violation (I saw this in another review) as it’s only men who all look the same. There’s zero diversity of any kind across most regions and they refuse to acknowledge this or do anything meaningful about it. Sales execs and senior leadership leaving left and right over the past 18 months and it looks like that trend is continuing. Managers only care about the numbers and nothing more. You have no room to be person. My manager was responsible for 4 people either asking to leave their team, or who ended up quitting, and that manager is still with the company. Sales org is a good ole boys club and those who fall in line or get close to the right people will get good accounts, grace, and actual mentoring. Customer success org doesn’t seem to be much better. I’ve heard horror stories from other regions about women getting push back for wanting to take their full maternity leave or coming back after leave with all new accounts, etc. The most toxic and exhausting QBR experience with people regularly suffering from massive amounts of stress and anxiety or going to the bathroom to cry. Full of mind games. Also, no team building events besides binge drinking. If they want you gone they will push you until you just quit. Also, the pay is below the standard for sales execs now…If I can sum up this place in a few words: just a traumatizing boys club full of egos that are stuck in an echo chamber of their own beliefs."

After that, you must collect and tidy up your detailed notes before they're sent to the customer. Long story short, 9-5 won't cut it here. This creates a tricky situation for working parents in an egalitarian relationship who wish to see their kids during the week and not offload pickup to someone else.

Its famed culture started to decline soon after the arrival of several top level executives from Amazon, and once tech layoffs became fashionable, management blissfully declared that no layoffs were planned but instead ""raised the bar"" by vastly reducing the number of overperformers during each review cycle and enforced that 5% must be underperformers.

Perhaps this was seen as a way to combat the rapid rise, but did little to deal with people who were already in those roles; there were plenty of 'leaders' who are in no position to lead others. These people remained in positions of power while themselves underperformed, and are now pressured to deliver or streamline their costs. This resulted in making demands on their teams that started to overstep reasonable expectations, pushing those team members into the ""underperform"" category and finally managing them out with a performance improvement plan, despite performing well in every other metric, resulting in termination without severance. Culture, innovation, and work life balance now take a backseat at this company, but I suspect this is only the beginning."
MongoDB,3.0,"May 24, 2023",Query Team - Hard Time for Junior Engineers,Junior Software Engineer,Current Employee,,"- Vast majority of employees are extremely friendly and approachable. Everyone is knowledgeable and intelligent. - The work is interesting! The projects are very well thought out despite the problems being so difficult. - Code quality is mostly high. There's a lot of tech debt, but with time this will go away. This is a great company if you want to improve your C++ skills.","- Team choice is a coinflip. You can have a lead that is very available and will help you with career growth, or one that is invisible. Most leads are too busy with technical work to pay close enough attention to give feedback. Many junior engineers do not get any negative feedback unless they remind their lead many times. There are a few cases where promotions have been implied, but then at the last minute negative feedback is provided and no promotion is given. This is a hard situation to navigate for a junior engineer. - For the most productive engineers, bad behavior is ignored. These engineers are so knowledgeable and crucial to certain projects that consistently bad behavior is overlooked. They can be condescending and unapproachable with no repercussions. Many junior engineers avoid them, even though they are often the best person to ask questions. If you are on a team with one of these individuals and don't have another senior engineer to go to for questions, your career growth will be stunted. If you do ask them questions, they will give a bad performance review to your lead. Difficult situation for junior engineers."

Whiplash may arise when the sales leaders return from their annual offsite and present a new framework to the rest of the company. (but it's also a strength in that the Mongo sales team is probably in the top 5% tech sales cultures in the industry.) Where it can come into play is from a resourcing standpoint. Expect that if your team is not in Sales, you will run super lean. Secondly, as the company has become quite established (and big), many of the processes are fully built out. Depending on the org you are in, you may be more of an ""operator"" vs an ""innovator"". This comes down to personal preference on what you are looking for. But it definitely felt like a big company when I left, which wasn't the case when I joined."

Leadership is only focused on numbers and not their team. Very poor gender and diversity ratios. Very slow growth potential, especially if you are a person of color. Poor succession planning. Strangely enough the senior leadership keeps getting promoted, yet they keep doing the same job and nothing changes down the line. Poor feedback culture. Managers/Leaders will not help with personal growth. Huge dependency on account executives. Also, as soon as you join, the employee experience team will ask you to drop a review on glassdoor.

I have personally felt incredibly supported throughout my time at this company. The sales teams here are top-notch and are full of talented people who I continue to learn from. Sales at MongoDB will challenge you, but it will also be rewarding. Don't get me wrong, there is no question that the number of men in sales outweighs the number of women. However, leadership has acknowledged the disparity and is seemingly putting in a genuine effort to bridge the gap. We have amazing affiliate groups like MDBWomen's Group and Sell Like a Girl which have created opportunities for females and allies to network and find mentors across MongoDB. I'm always humbled to see that senior leadership regularly participates in these events.

With the merger, the executives continually boast about company performance and how it is good for everyone, but that is not being reflected in opportunities or with annual review/raises

Poor management threatens employees in the name of cost cutting so that they will not ask for anything else. A sense of status quo even when the market share is being lost. People are highly stressed out in their job which means the company culture is not good. They have people working in there for 10 -15 years and hence they lack the outlook of outside world. They don't hire inexperienced people and ask existing employees to check with family members and friends about what other organisations are doing. They hire contractors and treat them like second class citizens. Appraisals are sole discretion of Managers so they will raise pay for whomever they like. Management is very arrogant and won't listen to their shortcomings. And the list will go on.

No work-life balance. Bad management. Especially Indian managers have a superiority complex and bossy nature which they have picked up wrongly from the Japanese background.

No manager shows up on time when dealing with employee scheduled meeting. Except a few, everyone gives reason that they are very busy, but in reality no one is busy there. They are just busy playing games and poking nose in others' work.

For those who say salary is high - it is, but not helpful in long run. High salary is because of bonus and AWS. The basic salary is still not high. When applying for other jobs in Singapore, perspective employers only consider basic pay. So it does not provide any edge for new career opportunities.

The company prefers the obedient employees to the technically capable ones and elect the former to be leaders.
- no scapegoating: the distribution of responsibility is deliberately blurred, such that those who are truly to be blamed for buggy code, wrong technical decisions and unstable architecture can hide themselves behind their scapegoats.
- breakthrough: many of the breakthroughs just break through the obstacles made within the company, such as unsuitable technical choices and buggy implementations. Highly usable and widely accepted libraries, tools and frameworks are out there, yet the engineering team chose to build our own.
- contingency plan: do we have a contingency plan in the midst of financial struggles?
- human skills: the so-called leaders do not represent or fight for the welfare of his/her subordinates. Often they stand with their leaders and squeeze their subordinates together.
- boss-driven over product-oriented: implementation, troubleshooting and decision-making are driven by bosses' demands, rather than being rooted in facts or product oriented. Development may change course anytime as long as some big bosses want it that way, despite the fact that it breaks development roadmap or apparently violates engineering practices.
- process over engineering: overly complicated processes are made to restrict technical discussion and decisions and writing, submitting and releasing code, which is iconic Japanese Ho-Ren-So culture and greatly endorsed by higher managers. Managers block developers from submitting code, thinking it is able to stabilize the build and improve the quality of products.
- firefighting over troubleshooting: too many engineers are mobilised for putting off sparks instead of solving the root problem. Too many temporary fixes have been made permanent.

The office is full of young people. There are some who are really talented and most of co-workers are nice and friendly. 

- Flexible working hours (depends on the team)
The working hours are pretty flexible if deliverables are not due and you do not have meetings to attend. However, there is no option to work remotely. 

- Possibility of transferring to Japan
It is possible to request for a transfer to Japan after you stay for a certain period of time in the company. It's an opportunity for those who wants to experience the Japanese culture. 

- Excellent sales team 
The sales team in Japan is top notch. They are actually able to sell software based on nothing but paper. In fact, they are the ones that are lifting the entire company.","- 50 shades of managers
Clueless, racist, incompetent, pushers, know-it-alls, pretenders, and the list goes on. Just name a trait and you have a very high probability of finding a manager like that. 

- Out of touch top management
The top management is completely out of touch with the situation on the ground and the actual status of the product. Because of this, they are making decisions which becomes a hindance or has no impact value. 

- Politics among managers
When you try to request help from other teams, the other team managers always find some way to avoid it instead of trying to find a solution. There is no smooth collaboration between team managers. In the end, nothing gets done and delays keep piling on. 

- Spreadsheets for everything
They love to use spreadsheets for all purposes, instead of using proper tools. This applies even for diagram drawing. Can you imagine how troublesome it is to create complex diagrams in excel? 

- Misallocation of resources
PhD holders do screen mockups; Master's holders do trivial work; Arts graduates write code; Developers write essays and draw UI instead of coding. There isn't a proper allocation based on skills and interest. 

- No experts with experience
The tech architecture leads are wannabes who has no real experience with production software. Their decisions are supported with weak evidence at best. There is no real tech lead who has the know-how and expertise to lead the way. 

- Reinventing the wheel
They love to reinvent the wheel instead of using something that has been battle-tested. Instead of paying a small cost to use commercial software, they pay even more money to reinvent it in-house, which ends up being subpar. Some excellent libraries and frameworks are even open source so it costs nothing to use . They recreate everything in-house, claiming that what is in the market cannot achieve what they want. The outcome is a bloated piece of mess that constantly breaks every step of the way. In addition, the upper management forces these frameworks to be used, which totally hinders productivity. 

- Dubious development cycle
Their ""sprints"" have all the negatives of agile and waterfall, but none of the benefits. 

- Resistance to change
Even with all the above cons, the higher management refuses to admit their mistake and change their strategy. Instead, they pat themselves on the back and say all is dandy. The bottom level can so clearly see the inherent flaws and there are so many calls for change but it doesn't happen. 

- No structured training
There is no process where people can pick up skills in a natural manner. Because you don't learn much, your skills remain stagnant."

During my brief tenure of just under three months, there were three turnovers within the team. The work environment was toxic, with instances of bullying and gaslighting by the manager leading to burnout among team members. 
Additionally, there was a severe lack of work-life balance; I was told time off during critical periods such as the last two weeks of the quarter and the last week of every month, including the period between Christmas and New Year will be denied. This lack of flexibility would pose significant challenges, especially for those with familial responsibilities. 
The manager's behavior was egregious, often resorting to shouting and yelling at employees. Despite reporting these issues to HR, there was no meaningful response or action taken. 
While many IT companies espouse values of empowering women and promoting work-life balance, OT fell far short of these ideals. Proceed with caution, as this environment may not align with your professional or personal well-being."

-Enough other great people working there (all of whom are unfortunately being taken advantage of) that you could meet some good friends
-Free food sometimes","This company is the biggest bait-and-switch I have ever seen in Corporate America, and I have seen a lot. 

First they'll recruit you promising the world. Great culture, career opportunities, etc. Their initial pay offering will be below market and they'll justify it as a big company that keeps certain strict pay bands. They'll draw you away from a well paying, stable, comfortable job by promising you the world. 

You will learn fairly quickly that it is almost impossible to get a decent raise, even just enough to keep up with inflation. Even if you are a good employee meeting all expectations, they use ""forced curve"" annual reviews. So even if you have no performance problems and no actionable feedback, if there are enough ""higher performers"" in your department, no raise. The ""higher performers"" will often have more to do with what type of work is available and/or office politics than anything within your control.

This point will vary by department, but EXTREME disorganization. People being hired to report to one manager and then being switched around to report to another. This is not uncommon. There are many incompetent people working here at all levels and not much accountability for you having to do their job for them.

They may (and will!) promise you that the mass layoffs they are doing will not affect your department, right up until the day that you get a call from HR saying your department was slashed by layoffs by 50%. People will be laid off despite zero performance issues. No job stability.

From what I have observed, they did at least 5 rounds of sneaky layoffs, which they did in rounds stealthily so as to try to avoid mass panic and regulatory requirements. All this while touting how wonderful their latest acquisition (that caused the layoffs) will be for the company and its employees. 

After they lay off almost half of your department, they are also surprised when some people panic and quit, your department can't function, and deadlines are missed. So they go into full panic mode re-hiring for the well-performing employees they laid off/lost. Constant cycle of corporate over-hiring, over-layoffs, overcorrection. Absolute waste of good talent, and the most astounding lack of self-awareness by HR and the people making these decisions. 

Finally: absolute bureaucracy at all levels. Be prepared for every minor aspect of your job to take 5 times as long as it needs to, because of the layers of bureaucracy that persist in many departments. HR and IT are especially incompetent, but it is a company-wide problem. This company is bloated, probably beyond repair (and the layoffs don't seem to hit the departments that everyone knows are functionally useless - odd.)

Advice to applicants: don't be fooled, they are the epitome of everything that is wrong with Corporate America, while they put a pleasant face and pay lip service to caring about employees, but only care about the bottom line and will treat you as poorly as is convenient. If the pay and benefits and work experience are worth it to you, take the paycheck, line item on the resume, and run without looking back as soon as you get a better opportunity."

OpenText,1.0,"Feb 1, 2024",The one star is for the way things were...,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",,"Historically, under a different guise, this would have been an entirely different review...unfortunately, the changes haven't been kind to this business.

If I could no stars, I would.","Be prepared for a lack of clear direction and inconsistent leadership. The decision-making process appears to be driven more by budget constraints than by a genuine understanding of the market or customer needs - this spans across the internal operations and the technology too. The company is known in the market as ""the place that software goes to die"" for a reason and why the business has historically survived on auditing customers.

One of the major cons is the disconnect between the company's stated values, such as ""Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion"" and the actual work environment. Despite the rhetoric, there's a noticeable lack of diversity in leadership, promotions are based more on personal connections than merit - and this is even less likely if you fall under the category of any traditionally marginalised demographic in the field of Information Technology.

The management, predominantly composed of older individuals, seems resistant to change and innovation. Decisions feel outdated and out of touch with the fast-paced nature of the industry. This makes it challenging for teams to adapt to evolving market trends and meet customer expectations effectively.

Furthermore, the work culture can be toxic, with a pervasive sense of mistrust and lack of transparency. It's as if the leadership is more focused on cost-cutting measures than fostering a healthy and collaborative workplace.

Beware of the graduate programme; it lacks clear direction and valuable suggestions from seasoned professionals seemed to go unnoticed. The teams were guided by peer-to-peer engagement from individuals with minimal experience, akin to the blind leading the blind. Progression within the programme appeared driven solely by cost-cutting motives, as experienced colleagues were let go and replaced by newly ""qualified"" grads with substantially lower salaries. Consider this before committing to a path that might lack the mentorship and strategic guidance needed for a successful career.

In summary, if you value a dynamic, inclusive, and forward-thinking work environment, OpenText may not be the ideal place for you. The organisation seems stuck in outdated practices and fails to deliver on its promises of a diverse and inclusive workplace. Consider other opportunities where you can thrive without being hindered by the limitations of a company out of touch with the reality of today's business landscape."

salary is always on time
30 days vacation","Very toxic management. It feels like totalitarian regime
People are not allowed to express their opinion or to bring up flaws. If they do, they are being silenced and marked as ""negative"". 
The managers keep introducing extremely annoying rules and changes, which almost never work. Bring additional pointless tasks all the time.
Sometimes they will introduce changes that seems only there to justify the existence of someone otherwise completely useless.

Company cost cutting a lot, removing bonuses, cutting everything they possibly can lately.

Lower tier managers are just pupets, they are afraid to question any decision or rules coming to them nor bring any flaws higher and try to hide any problems. There is no point to share anything to them as it just goes to a black hole.

The whole work organization is a complete chaos, no proper tiers, everyone doing everything. Senior employees annoyed by noob tasks, junior ones stuck with advanced tasks. 

80% of the job is a call center, answer random phone calls many times from annoying people asking you to ""do the needful"". Sure at the same time you have to do something more advanced and constantly be interrupted by those calls.

Progress is completely 0. If you want a promotion, make sure to become a puppet to the proper manager. Don't dare to question anything he says, especially on a team meeting.
Although it is questionable how much a ""promotion"" is worth it, since there are many cases where employees reject promotions because they are traps. 

Management name and introduce positions with fancy names like ""cybersecurity engineer"" just to be attractive but then you actually do call center work.

I am probably missing something, but the review will become way too long if I will be listing everything. Just stay away from this place unless you are desperate for some job, and especially if you are really skilled IT person."

Lots of product training.,"Depending on who your manager is will drastically influence your experience. Culture is declining and getting more severe. Focus on bottom line is being pushed harder and ruthless layoffs when profit isn't what the street expects makes people nervous. Unrealistic quotas (but that isn't really new). Mangement of quota payouts is *really* poor. The good, helpful, everybody wins culture is fading as external hires dilute it (more promotion from within would help keep it).

Good if you want to learn the basics of Cybersecurity. Great if you want to be part of a global company, where everyone runs around like a chick with the head cut off. I loved Acronis from afar for several years. I was thrilled to become part of the team, and imagine how completely let down I felt, when I realized what Acronis really was. Excellent benefits and PTO Working remotely was wonderful. Best engineers you will find.","I really think there are too many to list, but I will try: -Please NOTE- Patrick is NOT the CEO and has not been for a bit. -Pay is very much below industry average. You are not paid near what your experience is worth. Lowest in the industry by far. -Upper management always fibs, and has no loyalty to their direct reports. -HR and upper level execs are in league, so if you ever need anything, or need to report something that is affecting you, nothing will be done, and you will be reprimanded for speaking up. -Company grew way too fast in the last year, making up role titles, and hiring people off the street to fill these roles, only for it all to end badly. They are trying to ""puff up"" to look good for a sale or going public. -You are forced to sign a new KPI/ Sales quota/ target attainment agreement each quarter. Sometimes twice a quarter. -Commissions are capped. -You do not get your ""bonus/ comm"" for weeks, sometimes months, after the end of a quarter. -Despite what has been circulated, Acronis is a Russian company, with Russian founders and owners, period. -New CEO, 3 days in, company wide layoff's. -Acronis blows money on things that are NOT needed and not profitable, instead of investing in Acronis and its employees. -Acronis' mission statement is NOT partner aligned or focused at all. -Acronis will not invest in a stateside support team, and this has caused a huge rift with partners. They can not get support on the line when they need it, as it is all across seas. The support team is lazy, and even when directed to call a partner, they will not. They continue to email and send video's and KB articles. Not a professional means of communication or assistance to partner's at all."

Their messaging and support often do not align and if you get caught in between the two parties you are screwed.

The 1am meetings followed by 7am meetings the following day seem a good place. This is a global company without regional division, which means you will be expected to work around the clock. You will have to sleep during the day to get any sleep at all. 

Executive management is concerned only with growth, even if at the expense of employee health, and without regard to feasibility. Despite being told ""no,"" sales will promise moon to earn and keep business (which is difficult sometimes), and you will be forced to work your knuckles to the bone to make it happen. When it fails, as you said it would, you will still take heat because leadership does not stand up for its employees. 

There is no clear vision, no process. Hope you enjoy spending 4-8 hours a week doing nothing but PowerPoint, because it seems to be the only way information is communicated. Documentation isn't kept, let alone read.

There is no such thing as work life balance here. You will be subject to meetings at every hour of the day. Say no? You're not a team player. 

Hiring practices are in utter disarray, as the criminally understaffed HR cannot get a job offer to a candidate in time for them to accept it. By the time one goes out, they've likely moved on.

Company culture/philosophies are backward and offensive. Don't believe anything about a bonus. If you are desperate enough to accept a position here, get details about the bonus you won't be getting and so you can ask about it every quarter why you didn't get it. Pay is low for their expectations. Seriously, headquarters in Switzerland and Singapore? You'll quickly understand what folks run this company and from where. The headquarters are just a smoke screen for the real culture behind the company. As for ""Cyber Protection"", good luck with that.

If you are looking to develop yourself and learn new things -  this is the best place.  It's so easy to make an impact and all the results are visible because everything is so transparent. Competence and excellence are recognized and rewarded.
 
It's not about who you know or what team you're working for — if you do amazing things here, it will be seen and acknowledged. It doesn't matter whom you report to, what level you are, or when you started here – if you are consistent, responsive, willing to help, and do your job well, you will thrive.
 
Personally, Acronis was a perfect match for my character. I like how management is not afraid to change things up and try new things. The company is moving fast and executives are never bored. Having the ability to make decisions and take responsibility for them was really refreshing compared to my previous companies.  Mistakes can be made in such a fast pace, so you have to be able to acknowledge, fix it and move on. 
There are no limits to what you can do here –   you are able to do what you can and want, which moves you closer to the edge of your capabilities and constantly pushes your boundaries. It is a great place to learn business strategy and participate in decision making that has material impact.","Because of the speed, there are frequent changes in org structure.

It doesn't happen overnight, but many of those who continue to work hard and deliver results are given more responsibilities and opportunities.
Each position has an individual contributor aspect (even at higher levels) which means you must be hands on and willing to do a lot of work yourself. Due to the size and nature of the company, most roles cover multiple areas of their department and business. This gives you more ownership of the work, career growth, and development. It also means you can see the impact of your work and know that you were the person who delivered (or helped) those results. 
Another plus is that Acronis is worldwide, which allows you to work with different people, cultures, and regions. 
In all, Acronis has given me so much over the last 3 + years - a career, a family, long lasting relationships, and unforgettable memories.","Acronis is not for everyone because it is a fast-paced environment with higher than average workloads and responsibilities. There also have been some changes in management that have caused a little turbulence throughout the years here. But if you can manage the changes, fast pace and heavy workload, Acronis will benefit you so much.

The software is also incredible. The product should be so easy to sell!","The CEO has spent way too much money on F1 marketing to keep up with other Russian software companies - and the employees are paying for it. The pay is below average salaries in the area. A handful of managers and VP level people have been let go and we no longer have company get-togethers to foster those ""team building"" relationships.

Here are few reasons I enjoy my time here:

- Diversity & the people: companies often tout how diverse their workplace is, but often they ""try hard"" to hire diverse groups of people. At Acronis, it comes naturally - you get to meet people from all around the world and continuously learn from one another.

- Fast-paced environment: you'll never get bored as things are always changing, but that doesn't mean we don't have fun along the way.

- Your opinion matters: It doesn't matter what position or level you're in - your opinion will matter when it comes to projects - you're on a team!

- And some other superficial things in the office: pool tables, snacks, unlimited caffeine by Boston Coffee Company...","We're a growing company with some growing pains (with our [legacy] systems).

Our Acronis global Team is very diverse, we have 18 offices across the global, with varieties of cultures and nationalities. Understanding cultural differences helps overcome communication challenges at work. Currently, my team works across all time zones including Grater Boston Area, Munich, Moscow, Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney. As I am in a global role, I have to stay connected with my peers and be able to support their business needs. I value that global experience, as it provides me with understandings of how different markets operate.

The other great part is a technology side. We are early adopters of cutting-edge technologies. I am getting invaluable and sometimes unique experience that increases my tech skills. I am getting deep understanding in products and technologies we develop. 

Last but not least, is a fun part. We try to keep our offices connected through our social media channels by sharing their team and individual pictures with hashtag #AcronisPeople on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. I am keen to know, what is a life looks like in our other offices. That is a fun part, but very important to keep global team connected.",Life-time balance sometimes is hard to active due to projects and different times zones.

During my time, I've had the opportunity to work in different departments. It's a great place to work and has helped me understand company structure and the business side of things, which in my opinion, is great exposure to help carry on in any future position. While I love my position, the great healthcare benefits, and the perks/incentives (we have snacks in the kitchen, F1 gaming simulators and a Foosball table - come on!), the people are what make this Company outstanding. They surprised me with a Bridal Shower right before my wedding, sent flowers to the funeral home when my family member passed away and continuously show appreciation for my efforts. The healthcare benefits are also really great and they truly care about what employees would like to see (for example, they now offer a 401(k) match after many inquiries). With a pre-existing condition and having numerous medical appointments, I've never been more thankful and appreciative for the insurance coverage Acronis has to offer. Overall, I'd recommend this Company without a doubt.","Internal systems could be better - as with any global company, it can be hard to find systems that have the capability to function globally; but it is something they are working on"

* Management doesn't communicate changes that are made
* Management talks down to their employees.  They say ""my business"" when it's actually ""our business"" we are all trying to reach a number.
* turnover is at an all time high.  I've seen three general managers over the course of 2 years.
* They are bringing in several people from other countries to ""manage"" but they don't understand how business in the US works.
* When people leave the refuse to pay their vacation time.
* HR won't respond when there are issues.  And when you need an immediate response they blow you off.
* Very shady business practices.  Discounting for one not for another.  Accounts stolen by other account managers.  Management has no control over their business.
* lots of pressure from upper management to commit to a number without having the data or resources to figure out the data.
* They have hired several new ""leaders"" that don't understand the business.  They don't understand how things work and they don't give effective training.
* The latest version of the product has not worked for several customers and the refuse to do any RMAs for these issues."

Nice base salary

Leads provided for you - no cold calling -

Snacks/meals/luncheons provided often","Unfortunately,I have a few items to discuss here.  I really want to like everything about this company, but there are a few areas that must be improved quickly.  

First, the company has sort of a start up feel, since they are regrouping after many years. However policies and procedures are extremely disorganized and subjective. Professionalism is lacking in that sense. Answers are given one day on something, only to be changed the next day.


Also, The base salaries are good, but the quotas are unreasonable, and slightly demotivating in your efforts to reach them. Although you make a decent base salary, it’s rather hard to hit your on target earnings.  Higher payout for commissions is highly recommended, to provide more motivation for the employees. If it means a slightly lower base salary, that is something to consider, but I think the current commission structure is not designed properly for full motivation and commitment.  

The overall management/attitude is not where it needs to be. It’s a very black and white culture, almost like a dictatorship, There’s no fairness when it comes to making decisions on discrepancies that can happen from time to time. They treat you more like objects, then human beings. This is my biggest concern, and I hope this can be addressed quickly. .  Genuine compassion, support, and fair treatment needs to be implemented to really grow this company to the next level.  Just use common sense and treat people how you would like to be treated ."

Xerox heavily leans on temp contract workers during a time when it’s a employee market, meaning quality will be lacking. This year Xerox didn’t provide a good method for tracking vacation time. Poor communication. Xerox pay is poor. I was “promoted” to site manager, a hand shake promotion. Meaning given the extra responsibility with no official promotion. I’ve stayed at the same level. They did nothing for my coworker for her 30th work anniversary except for a pin. 30 years, nothing. In 8 years they’ve only removed benefits, not added any. They’ve also put managers on several accounts. Meaning I have 2 managers who I haven’t actually seen in several weeks. If things seem to be going ok, they focus on accounts that are falling apart. My operation manager’s only knowledge about how my account is doing is just what I tell him. There used to be a manager on site most of the time. This keeps people on task better.

Additionally, despite working 48 hours per week every week, management was able to manipulate the schedule in such a way where half the weeks worked would yield no overtime (half of the weeks would be 48 hours, the other half 36). They absolutely knew what they were doing. It's even worse considering how high the profit margins are (or at least were) on this product. Obviously, they don't care at all about their employees in the slightest.

Then there's many employees themselves. When I was there, the toner specialists were almost completely divided into two groups (with rare exception) - kids just getting out of college with no prior full time work experience, and old disgruntled laid off Kodak employees. The former group was what I was part of, and consisted of a lot of good people. The latter was much more problematic. While some of the older workers were fine, many were unbelievably nasty. Racism, homophobia, and sexism ran rampant to a degree that I have never seen at any other job. I worked at L3Harris after this - I am not exaggerating when I say that many of these guys would've been walked out the door within weeks of being hired there. But the Xerox toner plant not only tolerated it - they promoted many of these guys. When people say that Xerox hasn't adapted to the 21st century, they mean it in every possible way."

You're not paid based on your qualifications. - Big push to apply for jobs you knowingly aren't qualified for. - No office space...in 3 years I never went to an office nor was I given any form of company id or badge. - Lots of live training offered, but most of it will be off-limits to you due to Coforge ""verticals"" structure. - Business units within Coforge seem to be in competition with each other instead of working together. - You will have nobody in management here to advocate for YOU. It's important that you realize you are on your own, nobody will give you any direction on training or career improvement or job placement.

With a startup's fast pace, there was a lot to do and create, but we felt cared for and treated as people. We wouldn't say we were like a family, however, we called ourselves a ""tribe"".","After being acquired and joining Encora Inc., there is the feeling of slowly becoming another global offshore company. Policies are being created fast and with lots of effort, but they probably fall short as more people need to be involved in this critical project. 
Compliance training is very generic, and dull, with old repetitive information and unfortunately, cultural nuances are not usually considered in the company.
The company seems to try to complete a checklist of very important topics that every global company should follow, but some of those topics (like DEI) feel rushed in and not sincere, except only for the initiatives created by the employees. 

In Mexico, specifically, communication from top to bottom is not good at all, promises were made and were not respected (gympass and salary reviews in 2022), and the big problem here is that we only realized that they were not gonna happen because people started to ask what was going on.

Good salary
Interesting clients and super helpful products with a great reputation
Reasonable, though not exactly generous, PTO","Business trajectory is highly uncertain, given the number of T1 retailers either going under or slashing spend. 
-Zebra execs may not want to admit it, but the company clearly spent recklessly during the pandemic and the bloat has never been more obvious than in recent months
-Work-life balance is something many employees have only ever heard of
-Jaw-dropping, disturbing, and infuriating amounts of favoritism and nepotism, especially when it comes to promotions and career advancement
-If you’re hired as a specialist, be prepared to remain one for a LONG time. Management promotions are far and few between, and the rare opptys that do become available often go to the hiring managers’ buddies. Sabotaging/undermining qualified employees to clear the way for friends is definitely not unheard of…
-Questionable accountability, as leaders of consistently underperforming teams rarely seem to face any consequences or executive intervention (again, could also speak to favoritism)
-Layoffs have left a wake of paranoia, grief and confusion that is still lingering
-Slipping morale - never seems to be any genuinely good news coming from C-level, only (slightly) silver-lined clouds
-Some teams (or entire divisions) are incredibly cliquey, especially post-acquisitions, and make it very difficult to fit in. My division was once a great, welcoming, fun, inclusive place to work — until we inherited a large number of employees from an acquisition. The acquired product quickly became a top revenue generator, and as a result, all employees who’d come from that acquisition were held in the highest regard (to the point of pampering). Eventually the blatant double standards, chauvinism, entitlement, favoritism, and other unprofessional behaviors while leadership literally sat back and watched turned the environment toxic"

This company is on the way to becoming a proxy billing service for Microsoft. They do not have their own cloud infrastructure. It all goes through Azure. When Microsoft changes the rules, they have absolutely no control over it or say in it. 

If I ever hear someone use the term ""Customer Delight"" unironically again, I'm going to throw up. All they care about is numbers. Making customers happy means nothing. Some SVP or Director logs into PowerBI while they drink their coffee, and if the board isn't completely green, the managers get a nastygram. It's a call center. 

""Hey, I know this isn't your product, but I need you to take this four day training with broken labs and then immediately start taking cases. No, there isn't any extra compensation for this. Have you taken any cases yet?""

I'd hope to spend another ten years at this place. I was content with what I did, and I felt no need to climb any corporate ladders. I'd have been happy to retire. If the product I invested a decade of my life into hadn't been left to rot in hospice, it may have happened. As it were, it ended with no warning on an otherwise regular day.

My customers gave me a warmer sendoff than my manager did. That should tell you all you need to know. 

The only thing that truly matters to leaderships is making money for the VC firm that overpaid for the brand back in 2015.

Compensation Alignment Concerns: Concerns about the alignment of compensation structures within WSM and uncertainties surrounding the transition of the Customer Success Organization raise questions about incentivizing desired behaviors and outcomes associated with customer success.

 Leadership: VP Level was condescending, arrogant, and consistently made others feel inferior. Director level leadership - absent/unavailable. When it came to direction/vision/goals, very hands off and vague, not great people management. 

 Culture: antiquated/outdated, just like the products they offer. While HR has all the necessary practices in place to keep up to save face, the culture provided by leadership and long time employees feels disconnected and frankly depressing. A lot of my initial meetings with colleagues were spent hearing them air out their grievances.

Processes: never been part of a company that moves more slowly to get things done in product and development. Communication between the two are incredibly disjointed due to old school practices and lack of formal process.

If you're looking for a modern software/product company who practices agile methodology and delivers on consistent, shorter, intervals with good team collaboration and communication, you'll be left sorely disappointed."

They compare architects with 1 and 2 year people and create what they call stack ranks for a given organization. Obviously the senior people come high in the rank. New people end up being low in the rank because they are less critical to business. Then from that stack rank, they put bottom 15% in PIP. Doesn't matter whether they are bad or not. Then they subject them to in-human torture where they force people to resign through their PIP process. If you are joining this company, do ask HR about the appraisal process and stack rank. Ask them to show the published process on how they employee stack ranking and what rating they give. This is something which is not documented anywhere but they follow. This stack ranking they don't talk about it openly but it is part of their work culture. The managers knows about it but they don't tell their employees on stack ranking and why someone have gone into PIP.

1. Culture : This is one of the most important thing I like about NICE. It has vibrant, open and inclusive culture. Be a getting opportunity to try new things, express yourself, respect to each other , openness or politics-free environment, you will never regret being here.
Particularly for my BU, we have Sports days planned throughout year, many cultural events, Coffee with senior directors and offsite every quarter for manager happens without fail. Truly this is something differentiates and bring excitements when we work here.

2. Personal Growth: I have seen rewards and recognition are given for deserving candidates. Everybody is measured by same scale and processes are transparent. There are most people coming from Product companies who has rich experience and you get to learn from them. Increments are above market standards. In NICE, I have not see company firing anyone other than non-performers even in Covid or in slow job markets. So job stability is there.

3. Professional Growth: There are various groups and initiatives for every role and specialization. Be it devOps, Front end, even managers and directors.

The leadership team specially in WEM actively promotes a positive and inclusive atmosphere, It's not just about completing tasks; it's about enjoying the journey together.

Fun at Work (5/5): At NICE, the mantra is 'no work without fun.' The company understands the importance of a positive and enjoyable work environment. From team-building activities to exciting sports days, there's always something happening to break the routine and create a lively atmosphere.

Regular Leadership Coffee Meets (5/5): One of the unique aspects of working at NICE is the regular coffee meets with leadership. This open and informal setting allows employees to engage with leadership, share ideas, and gain valuable insights. It's a fantastic initiative that promotes transparency and a strong sense of community within the organization.

Training Opportunities (5/5): NICE places a strong emphasis on continuous learning, offering high-quality training programs at all levels. Whether you're a newcomer or a seasoned professional, there are ample opportunities to enhance your skills and stay updated on industry trends.","No cons as such, NICE Ltd is on a trajectory of success, marked by a dedication to continuous improvement.

Leading CCaaS solution - CXone","Unfortunately, if you don’t have existing accounts, and if it’s all white space, unless you’re lucky enough the accounts you have are adversary’s. Far too many sales people with few accounts. If you’re in the Premier group, you’re golden. National group, you’re screwed. 90% of my accounts have been worked over for years and are not B2C markets (target market for CXone is B2C). I have a great team & manager. Just real crappy accounts and I’m hearing this from other areas of the business like Key. Premier has so many accounts and oppy’s. Zero Inclusivity every team has entirely diff rules pitting reps against each other. This is a “product run company” not a “sales organization”. So much lack of ownership. Layoffs they try to hide (just had a decent trimming one rep per team let go). Base pay is alright but not when you factor in the healthcare costs/benefits and no RSU’s. RSU’s go to leadership. Makes zero sense. Lack of support. Just a poorly run company overall. Takes a week at times to complete a quote in COQ. There’s almost a million SKU’s from all other LOB’s NICE has acquired. And never cleaned up. They over complicated the messaging and product offering. The company is its own worst enemy. Deawn out, complex sales process. 80% of new business comes from existing base. Unless you have that^ you’ll be set up for failure day one. Also, the SE’s are the own the sales process. It’s completely out of my control. As a seasoned tech seller I’ve never not been able to conduct customer demo’s. It’s bizarre. So once you do that you have to always bring in your SE and many other people from other parts of the company. I swear I spend at least 10 hours a week just getting schedules done internally for customer calls. There are better sales options out there that aren’t as expensive to work for."

NICE,1.0,"Dec 17, 2023",Concerns About Work Culture and Management at NICE UK,Senior Specialist,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","London, England","None, The Only Positive side is the Office is located in central London and near to the station.","I have been working at NICE UK for 8 years, and I feel compelled to share my experiences.

Senior Management and Micromanagement: The senior management approach often feels micromanaged, impacting work-life balance. Requests for leaves often go unapproved, adding to the stress.

Employee Turnover: There's a noticeable high turnover rate. Many colleagues have been terminated, placed in Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs), or felt pressured into resigning, creating an unstable work environment.

Workload: The workload is extremely high. Often, one engineer is expected to handle the responsibilities that would realistically require multiple people, leading to burnout.

HR Practices: In my experience, the HR team appears more aligned with management than employee welfare. This has led to a lack of trust in HR's ability to impartially address employee concerns.

Compensation and Benefits: There have been no increments, bonuses, or financial growth opportunities, which is demotivating and not in line with industry standards.

Office Attendance Policy: The policy mandating office attendance feels rigid, especially as the HR team themselves do not adhere to it consistently. Disciplinary emails for non-compliance add to the stress.

Contractual Obligations: The terms of the employment contract feel overly restrictive, including clauses that require repayment of bonuses upon resignation, which seems unfair.

Lack of Transparency: There is a notable lack of transparency in decision-making processes, which affects trust and morale.

Career Growth: Opportunities for professional growth and advancement seem limited, impacting long-term career development.

While these are my personal experiences and observations, I hope they provide insight for potential employees and a perspective for the company to consider for improvement."

NICE,5.0,"Nov 20, 2023",Excellent Place to Work,Tech Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Pune,"I am happy to express my satisfaction with the excellent company culture and leadership at NICE. Under the visionary guidance of our leadership team, the company forms clear long term and short term strategic vision and communicates it well with the organization. NICE has fostered a culture of innovation and technological advancement that sets it apart in the industry. Company wide events like Sparkathon, TechFest etc. give a great platform to its employees to express their creativity and innovation.

The commitment of NICE to employee growth is truly commendable. The leadership actively supports professional development, providing opportunities for skill enhancement and career progression. The employees also get a good exposure to work on cutting edge technology. This investment in the workforce has significantly contributed to my own professional growth as well. NICE also appreciates the contributions of its employees in the form of rewards and recognitions.

Moreover, the vibrant work culture at NICE is a testament to the emphasis placed on employee well-being. Regular fun events not only foster a positive and collaborative atmosphere but also contribute to a sense of community within the organization. Events like Sports Days, Bash, festival celebrations, quiz, riddles, Marathons etc. are some of the examples. The senior leadership is also very approachable and even have connect meets from time to time with the employees.

In summary, NICE is not just a workplace; it's a dynamic environment where strong leadership, innovation, and employee development and engagement converge to create a truly exceptional professional experience. I am proud to be a part of this organization, and I look forward to contributing to its continued success.","Well, there aren't much Cons that I can think of in general.

The blame culture is toxic and makes you scared of stepping out of line or challenging management. New systems were recently put in place, making the workload a lot more difficult to manage, but the target was not compensated for. This led to the whole team failing to keep up with the workload, and all the team left (there is a very high turnover of staff because workers are exploited). Finding a work/life balance is extremely difficult, as the increasing workload and lack of pay increases meant that finding a half an hour slot to take your lunch break was impossible. I was put on an improvement plan for not being able to meet the target and had my sick pay taken away from me despite having worked there for a year and a half and always meeting expectations. Also, you don't get any recognition for good performance, just a ""pat on the back"" email with a smiley face. Career progression is rare, as long time workers aren't valued. The pay is extremely low for the amount of stress, pressure, and high expectations the job comes with. Some teams aren't held as accountable as others (making a mistake while on my team wouldn't have been noticed on any other team). Suggestions in team meetings were never listened to. Management fails to recognise when their employees are struggling. A lot of the staff are passive aggressive and patronising. The company claims it values mental health, but punishes employees for having mental health issues by taking away their sick pay and scaring them into doing better by putting their job on the line. The exiting experience was also miserable and poorly handled, again, proving how little the management will value you as an employee. No bonuses apart from the occasional pizza party. Though some team members were nice, it felt like this was because we could relate to each other with how bad the company is. Felt like fighting an uphill battle against management, and always being told to ""get over it"". Your performance is solely based on who is checking your deal input. A subjective bias from some team members will result in you being errored accordingly, thus making error quality reports decline unfairly. The company does not value its clients, as recent changes made it so less deals would be added to the system for clients to access."

However…  (read cons)","What happens when 3 major credit agencies have captured the credit rating market? 

You get the following: 
- a culture of stagnation, where there is no need to push boundaries or trail-blaze. Instead, this job is almost like a pseudo government job. 

- as a result, this is not the place for a young ambitious professional. 


- due to 08/09, compliance might be the biggest spend. This a nightmare for employees who are interested in actual intellectual and financial analysis.  The company has been forced to over invest in compliance and IT security and has severely underinvested in software capabilities for their employees.  The CEO once said, “we are ten years behind in technology” and that couldn’t be more true. 

Ultimately, the question, will this ever change? No. 

This is because the CRAs have captured a market and must satisfy quality to regulators to continue doing business as normal. 

This is not a hard proposition."

Also I feel the large pay bands that overlap positions leave little incentive to try to obtain promotions as most employees that I know of have received a 5% or less for a significant increase in job responsibilities with the promotion. The pay should be according to the job responsibilities, not a small percentage increase on what the employee was previously making. Many positions lack upward mobility/advancement and switching departments within the company is the only way to advance. I also think that this company at the current moment is not offering competitive salaries. I know that I could leave and have a higher offer by at least $20,000."

In that amount of time I struggle to come up with a single thing that has improved. Ever since West and Apollo took over they have slowly bled the company dry. 401k basically cut in half, PTO rebranded as vacation/sick so they don't have to pay it out when you quit or get laid off. Consistent layoffs to teams that are already extremely short staffed. There is a huge disconnect between folks working in the Longmont office and corporate. Corporate acts as overlords and we were all just along for the ride. Pay is laughably low considering being located in one of the most expensive counties in the country.

Darktrace,2.0,"Jan 22, 2024","Tough Role, but real opportunity",Accelerator Account Executive,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Washington, DC","-Darktrace has such a reputation for churning and burning sales employees that a short tenure isn't a big impediment to finding a new job if you have the right recruiter, and can even be a selling point for you
-Product is good, as far as I can tell
-Commission is legitimately great if you can close deals
-When my manager had the time, he provided me with insightful and actionable advice on how to improve

-If any reps are looking at this review while considering an offer or interview I'd encourage them to read the cons with this in mind: while all of the below is true - IT DOES NOT PRECLUDE SUCCESS. There are many reps, even on the accelerator team, who have a tremendous amount of success at Darktrace and the commission is strong enough that this leads to some really large paychecks. 

You will need to be very disciplined, very organized, and (don't underrate this) smart enough to grasp the product, competitive market-place, and how to effectively position the value. I'd recommend that you be brutally honest with yourself about your ability, motivation, and work ethic, because I'd say that a majority of people are not capable of being successful in this role as it is currently structured.","-Incredibly saturated market and while the product is good, what value add it has over competitors is remarkably difficult to demonstrate over the course of the sale without a lot of luck - this leads to very sales-technique focused approach that some would consider a bit slimy or shady. I think that's an overstatement but you do need to buy in fully to that to be successful

-Truly mismanaged training. Misguided in terms of content, delivery, and specificity (why are AEs, Sales Engineers and CSMs all on the same trainings?) Very little focus on the sales process which between the focus on POVs (proof of value - trials basically) and the (truly) archaic CRM actually necessitates a lot of training

-They're flexible in remote work but do not do a good job of fostering any sense of unity or culture for those remote teams - can be very mentally taxing with the activity levels you are expected to hit

-lack of transparency regarding inbound leads for accelerator team - clearly they receive them but seemingly they are doled out completely to the director or VP's discretion. Understandable to a point but when new reps are making 80+ calls a day and fighting to build pipe it can be discouraging to see that the more tenured rep who makes 5 calls a week (not exaggerating) has twice as many meetings booked 

-Mentioned already but the CRM is absolute nightmare and makes it near impossible to efficiently prospect, get information that you need, and effectively manage the sales process
 (NOTE: in fairness I think this will be fixed in the 2024 calendar year)

-tied into the above, the communication between sales functions follows a poorly designed structure which often leads to reps being assigned to calls that they don't have availability for (which should be the primary variable)

-There's somewhat of a disconnect between middle management and leadership on the accelerator team - the new VP was an outside hire who never sold darktrace while all the directors started as reps (and had success). This has led to a strange dynamic. The VP doesn't seem to know a ton about the product but is otherwise personable and intelligent (other reps would disagree with me but that's my opinion) - but is widely disliked by many reps who were around before he got there. This is in part due to the team being significantly reduced over the last year, largely through PIPs/terminations due to performance. From my viewpoint, it does seem like there were a lot of under-performers who were just free riders in the system prior to the new VP joining but I was not there. This has led to significant morale problems, which were already present given the workload. I wouldn't say that the middle managers outright dislike the VP but I do think there are contrasting preferences between them in their vision of how the team should operate

-the workload is very high. You need a significant amount of prospecting activity in order to generate a viable pipeline without inbound leads (which you won't get unless a director takes a shine to you) and darktrace's (earned or not) reputation for manipulative sales tactics doesn't do you any favors. On top of this there are no assigned territories and accounts can be taken from you by other reps very shortly after you get them. this adds another huge mental component to your workload as you also have to stay on top of what accounts are in your name (of often 200+) as well as all deals. 

-The company has essentially decided that spending marketing dollars on the SMB segment is not economically viable and thus just throws inexperienced sales reps at it and sees if they sink or swim. That may seem fair to you, but you should what you're getting into

-Unclear communication of expectations during ramping period and very little training on what to do to be successful off the bat

-Almost zero training on selling through the channel, which is crazy given where the rest of cyber is in that regard,DT's long term goals for selling that way, and the fact that is probably the most reliably consistent method of generating pipeline

-Middle management had limited availability due to often being on other reps calls as back up."

The veteran reps are scraping by while the junior reps are threatened daily and walk around scared of everyone. Everyone is scared of losing their job month to month. No joy. Nothing but vaping losers everywhere. 1 or 2 reps get fed all the inbounds and bring in 800% quota while 50 other reps are lucky to get 1 deal every 6-9 months. They only pay you half of 5% on TCV which now they just completely changed to ACV so will be a 3rd of total contract value. A third of all that gets taxed so you end up making a fraction of the total commission they try to promise you when you start. It's a 12 hour grind to maintain any type of healthy pipeline that if you even stop for more than 2 days you'll lose a grip of and feel underwater for the next month until your numbers reset again.

If you have a few bad months, expect a PIP then an exit. There's also a lot of persistent operational barriers to being successful (terrible in-house CRM, reps hoarding accounts) that make this job way more frustrating than it needs to be.

This company values a few ""top performers"" who they will help out no matter who they screw over in the process. You are constantly under extreme pressure to perform, but the performance expectations change too frequently to ever get in a consistent rhythm.

It is easy to ask for advice or help from other CTs. There are ways to progress internally and enable future learning and growth. Pay is good but not completely on par with other sales engineering positions.",Pay structure does not benefit this position as much as it does account executive (primarily pre-sales) or customer success managers (post-sales) which receive commission. There is also pressure from account executives which requires some push back. This position is somewhat undervalued at this company and this is reflected in the pay compared to other sales engineer positions at other companies. Management gives much more focus and praise to sales positions at this company than cyber technologists.

Darktrace,2.0,"Aug 12, 2023","If you’re going to do it, get in and get out",Sales Team Lead,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"Opportunity to work large accounts early in career Opportunity for promotion if you do well Great launchpad for starting sales career in cyber given cyber pays more than tradition SaaS tech sales. You can go to Darktrace for ~12 months and then leave to another cyber company to 1.5x-2x your base salary. So in one year you can make a base anywhere between 100k-130k as an enterprise AE somewhere else. You can skip multiple steps in your career by going here. No need to be an SDR or SMB rep. You can join as an enterprise rep right out of college or 1-3 years out. Many true enterprise reps have 5-10 years experience so when you leave you can command a salary that is way above your experience level. Some great, young people","The negative reviews you’ve read are spot on Base pay is under market Micromanagement is out of control: 2-3 internal meetings per day with your Director team (10-12 people usually). There are literally meetings on the calendar just to make sure people are working when remote. On the morning meeting everyone sets their goals for the day and on the EOD meeting everyone says if they hit their goals. This structure gets incredibly monotonous and the meetings are there just so management can feel like they are keeping track of everyone. Apart from the daily meetings, there are also 3-4 forecast calls a week and because the CRM is horrible, you waste time updating your directors and VPs about logistical info rather than talking deal strategy. Also depending on the Director these forecast calls can be used by management to publicly shame you in front of your peers for not hitting your numbers. I’m talking yelling and threatening your job in front of others. It feels like an elementary school teacher yelling at a student that is acting out. Darktrace has a horrible and high pressure sales culture. Because everything is measured monthly there is such a focus on short term results which leads management to pressure AEs by threatening their employment which leads to AEs pressuring their prospects/accounts for next steps. Because of this, Darktrace has a bad reputation in the market for being overly aggressive with prospects. Darktrace is good in that it gives young people the opportunity early in their career, but the flip side is that EVERYONE is under qualified for their current position. Because of this, management lacks experience and results to high pressure tactics to get results rather than actually developing their team by coaching. Most directors don’t know how to coach their reps. They don’t have the time or frameworks in place to get the most out of the reps. The directors are so time constrained that they only focus on active deals so new hires suffer and either sink or swim. Best advice for new reps, is to make friends with a good AE / team lead and get them to guide you and help you on calls because it’s rare to get that support from your director. If you are on the fence about joining Darktrace, I would think about it like this: If any of the following are true, then join: - you cannot get an AE role elsewhere for a higher base - you really want to get into cyber but can’t find an AE role elsewhere - you’re early in your career (just graduated or first or second job out of school) That said, if you do decide to join just know there will be a lot of stress that many can’t handle. It’s not a knock on you if you fall into that category but just know it going in. Everyone at Darktrace hits their breaking point at some point in their journey. AEs, team leads, directors, VPs, etc. There are stories/rumors that even VPs have had breakdowns of how much pressure upper management gives them. So it’s really a battle to decide to leave and get a higher base somewhere else or stay for the opportunity to close your current deals or look at a promotion. If you’re currently at Darktrace and don’t have a large pipeline and don’t see a promotion path I would suggest to look for a new job immediately. Overall I’m glad I joined Darktrace for where it got me, but I wouldn’t suggest it for those that can’t handle extreme pressure."

High turnover, no job stability, lies during interview process, unfair territories, no structure, inexperience management, etc. Overall, majority of new reps hired have been extremely disappointed with their experience so far. Word of advice: don't trust a word recruiters say during interviews. They will lie about the role to attract top talent. If I knew anyone was interviewing here I'd tell them to go anywhere else."

People keep leaving and there is overall low sales quota attainment. - I'm not quite sure what sales ops/enablement does because the way that the sales systems are set up, makes it even harder to prospect (on top of how difficult prospecting is). The prospect workflow is inefficient, the crm + prospecting platform do not speak to each other the way it should. Other company's sales systems are set up more efficiently. It just seems like a system we're stuck with... consider ripping it out. I don't want to blame the systems, but the way they are set up hinder sales prospecting which hinders revenue.

Toxic, toxic work culture rife with gossip. Every ""manager"" micromanages your day to day with endless meetings, listening to all of your phone conversations, and day to day activities. They do this to ultimately enable them to micromanage you out of your job. They are not there to critique you or constructively build you up in your position. They are there to threaten and berate you until you either quit or placed on a performance improvement plan. The average tenure is <6mos or even less, why? People leave jobs because of bad management. The directors, are junior without any real management experience, and everyone on the salesfloor is either new or on their way out. The tech stack, subpar and non effective. Let's discuss pay. If you think you're going to collect a commission check, forget about it, 90% of all reps don't hit quota, and if you think you'll float along surviving on your base salary alone, they'll make sure your managed out with unrealistic high quotas before hand. Closed a deal? Wait a year to collect commissions, if you're luckily still there, most aren't. Think of having a handful of accounts and you're constantly justifying productivity day to day and calling your customers back to back? This place is the epitome of fake productivity and fake work until you have just enough experience on your resume to escape the madness. If you're looking for experience, avoid this place, there are better healthier companies that strive to make you better, not tear you down and throw you out the door like trash and move on the next victim. If you're experienced, think twice. I've seen countless experienced reps leave once they experience the dissary, unprofessional management, and lack of communication. You can do 10x better just about anywhere better than this place. The ""higher"" base salary doesn't justify itself if most are gone before year 1, let that sink in."
Darktrace,1.0,"Sep 14, 2023",Darktrace Company Review as Previous Employee,Enterprise Account Executive,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","New York, NY","Commission Opportunities: Employees have the potential to build their book of business and earn commission, potentially adding a few thousands of dollars to their base salary. Decent Base Salary: A $75,000 base salary is provided, which can be a reasonable starting point for some individuals. Office : The company has a nice office in a nice location.","Poor Management: Many employees express dissatisfaction with the management team, from directors to VPs of sales. They report a lack of support, micro-management, and disappointment in results all around. No Internal Help : VPP does not help to make a standpoint to the employees and can not effectively help individuals feel heard to any capacity. Unrealistic Metrics: Some employees find that the performance metrics set by the company are difficult to achieve, possibly due to negative press, lack of accounts or other factors beyond their control. Limited Opportunities for Account Executives: Some account executives feel that they are not provided with enough opportunities to succeed, and the support from sales development representatives (SDRs) in booking meetings is lacking. Decent accounts only go to previous AE's who originally started with the company many years ago. Biased : Every employee is treated differently. Someone can work remotely in a different country for 1+ months whereas the other team member has to take PTO because they are feeling unwell and would like to work remote for 1-2 days. No standards. High Turnover Rate: Darktrace has a high turnover rate, with the average tenure being less than one year. This may indicate a lack of stability in the workplace. Cut-Throat Culture: The work environment is described as cut-throat, with frequent terminations and little room for true success or job security. Layoffs weekly. Lack of Positive Culture: Employees report a lack of positive culture, with no team outings or positive energy in the office. The company is seen as promoting disappointment rather than fostering a supportive atmosphere. Abrupt Termination: Some employees claim they were terminated abruptly, even when on the verge of closing significant deals, suggesting limited job security. Stressful Environment: This position and company plays a huge role to your mental health in a negative way. Negative Press : Look up ""Darktrace Negative Press"" and you will find all the information that has been currently going on with the financial standpoint of the company. No Diversity & Lack of women working at the company. Overall, Darktrace offers little potential for financial gain through commissions but a reasonable base salary. Their is a large # of issues related to management, culture, biased hire-ups and little job stability that may make it a challenging place to work for some individuals seeking a stable and supportive work environment."

They lie about the job responsibilities in the interview process to attract talent, but don't get too comfortable because they will fire you as soon as they hire you! Truly there are springs in every AEs seat. Management constantly changing & also weekly threats coming from the top about performance. Never any positive feedback or support from leadership - all they care about are numbers but hardly anyone hits their number so it's constant berating and threatening people's jobs on every weekly town hall. Really great motivation tactics!!!! Unrealistic metric expectations and insane micromanagement (they will listen in to your phone calls without you knowing and also check your activity throughout the day based on a ""heat map"" and question you if there are gaps of time where your heat map doesn't show activity). Way too many AEs in each region which leads to constant crossover on accounts and terrible feedback from prospects because every contact has been called minimum 20 times by different AEs. Horrible CRM that is a wannabe attempt at being Salesforce, but is extremely inefficient, always down, and leads to more disorganization. They only hire talent under the age of 35 and say anyone older wouldn't fit into the ""culture of Darktrace"". Best of luck if you want any support on deals or enablement because most of the directors don't even know the product. It's considered ""weird"" if you are with the company over 1 year, my entire office had all been there less than a year. They say they are a ""stepping stone"" in your career, and never once emphasized growth within the company. I made the mistake of ignoring these reviews when I accepted my offer so I want to help others make sure they don't make the same mistake as me. DON'T DO IT!!!!"

Friendly colleagues and good culture:
People here are nice and supportive. Peer engineers are highly capable and easy to work with. There are regular social events to build up team bonding.

No micromanagement:
There is no micromanagement here and your line manager gives you the autonomy to work on your own. However it may not be the same case for the project leaders in client.

Unique benefits:
Being able to work remotely outside of HK (under permission of client) is not something you can find everywhere.

Expanding network:
You will be meeting different people in different clients and be able to expand your network.","On bench from time to time:
Sometimes there is just no projects which fits you and you will be on bench between projects. You may have a feeling of not being needed (and it is absolutely not your fault).

Salary not so competitive:
The salary does not really match with permanent bank staff.

Relatively difficult to get promoted:
Client feedback contributes a large portion in determining your performance, but not all the clients are willing to give you a lengthy/thorough feedback to reflect it. Besides that, there are ""extra-miles"" you will have to cover (eg. hosting knowledge-sharing sessions) to secure a promotion. Being great at client project solely does not cut."

Good if you are coming from other country so you can start your career in Singapore as they do remote interviews and hire.","1. It is a consultancy firm. Meaning they will hire you and deploy in a client office (like an agency). Of course you will have to pass the client interviews and if not you will be on the bench. 2. Most of the time, you will not have a say in which technology/ project you will be working on. You will be just a contract employee with the client. 3. As you are working outside zuhlke office full-time(with clients directly), you will not inherit so called best culture. 4. your contribution will not be visible too as you are working for external client project. 5. Lack of visibility meaning, you will not be recognised. Eventually it might affect your increments/ bonus etc.. 6. Favourism there for europeans mostly. Management think they are the core, They will elevate them to lead positions easily and dump everybody else or dont care about others. 7.

Zühlke,4.0,"May 25, 2022",Probably the best consultant firm you can find in Hong Kong,Expert Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Hong Kong,"- Work life balance definitely. Although it's a consultant firm they strongly encourage work life balance and enforce it as much as they can. 

- Cutting edge tech and loads of best practices. You'll get to work with loads of awesome, smart, and amazing engineers and you will definitely learn a whole lot from them.

- Trust and support from management. They trust you with the work and with the way you work. Unlike traditional hk companies, they trust you when you call in sick (no doctor's note), they trust that you'll deliver on time. No micromanagement. They give you a plenty of freedom.

- They respect their engineers and they reward their engineers. Definitely a no blame culture and they try to understand the situation whenver something goes wrong. 

- Awesome, fun, and diverse culture. If you're tired of local HK culture, this is the place to be","- It is a consultant firm so it's difficult to avoid bad clients. Zuhlke management did they best to be selective and pick out the best projects for their engineers but every now and then they'd end up with a client who'd lie about the nature and the actual work of the project. (Chances are low, I just happened to be unlukcy)

- Salary is average. It's a good salary if you're not already in the banking industry. They can definitely be more competitive in their pay.

- Hong Kong reports to Singapore. I understand that they're trying to unify the standard across Asia but it's not quite fair to have those sitting in Singapore to evaulate you when you're sitting in Hong Kong and they know nothing about you."

Also, the company has grown a lot, many ""old"" people left and many new ones came, so it's definitely not the same as it used to be.

I agree with a previous comment that this is not a good place for minorities (in my opinion); specifically Black Americans. These people required me to repeat a training class that I'd already completed and passed 8 months prior because they didn't want to provide adequate mentor assistance (something they claimed would be available when requested). Their reason for me repeating? Because I had complained about the previous training session, although I wasn't the only person who had complained. However, I was the only employee required to repeat the session. I was even told (by a manager) that my comments might ""offend the mentors who had worked hard on the training material"". Then, to add insult to injury, I was terminated the day after I was told that I had done a good job on the completion of my second training session. Management is incompetent and gets offended when asked about job scenarios he/she doesn't understand, yet expects the less experienced employee to understand the same material. Mentors would either ignore requests for assistance or postpone it. I even had one mentor to ask if he could postpone assisting me so that he could help his friend with his resume. You may ask, ""Why didn't you report it?"" Remember....reporting issues will only get you fired... It's already been proven..."

It has huge backing from Mega players like Hyundai and Aptiv, which means A LOT, and we're accelerating towards delivering driverless vehicles in several cities very soon. Their pay structure is also good, with lots of stocks too, (unlike some other places where the stocks will expire if you leave, etc).

Motional,5.0,"Nov 18, 2022",It's a great place to work!,Principal Safety Engineer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Los Angeles, CA","I'll start with mentioning I'm biased because I prefer a start-up culture where there are opportunities to take more initiative and have a greater influence over the end product. Motional definitely allows individuals to take ownership of their work and drive solutions cross-functionally across the organization. The leadership are good at being transparent about issues that we're facing and helping solve challenges head-on rather than shying away. Everyone is very open and supportive. There's a solid culture for working together and helping each other rather than just trying to ""climb the corporate ladder"".","There are some challenges with overlapping responsibilities and roles across teams. Because every team is empowered to take initiative, many times there are multiple teams that end up working on similar things and duplicating work if they don't coordinate. There's also having ""too many cooks in the kitchen"". Sometimes many people want to provide their opinion which can inhibit progress from being accomplished. It's nice to have data to make decisions, but sometimes if the data does not exist engineers will struggle to make the best decision possible with the data that is available."

I missed a little over a week with an illness within my first 2 months, and it was not an issue at all. I also have a little vacation time off around the Christmas holiday that isn't an issue either, so I'll have used 2 weeks PTO in my first 2 months. Everyone that I've worked with has been friendly and helpful, both within and outside my team. Everyone that I've worked with has also been very knowledgeable on what they are working on.","There's a lack of company process, but that is a common thing with startups. This can be a pro and a con, but I've listed it under cons because Motional is working on a safety critical product in a regulated industry.

Motional,4.0,"Jan 25, 2023",Tons of Inertia - For better or worse,Senior Technical Program Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"Motional leaders seem to be generally willing to allow contributors to innovate and pursue ideas they find compelling. There is tremendous flexibility and ability to get the job done however the individual sees fit. Surprisingly for a company of its size and with so much influence/investment by major legacy corporations, there is not a lot of needless process and red tape over relatively trivial things. Overall, the attitude seems generally positive, the diversity of people is relatively strong, and the breadth of the company means there is tremendous opportunity for those who wish to find it. The amount of funding Motional has accrued at this point in 2022 has enabled it to become a relatively large company for AV, which even in light of some points of concern instills confidence in the survival of the company for long enough to really begin to truly scale the technology.","Unfortunately, the evolution of Motional as the confluence of several startups and contributions from an automotive OEM and Tier One supplier show...there is a head-scratching amount of work that is lost and redone between product iterations. There are, also, a surprising number of technical capabilities that younger and/or much smaller companies have already attained that Motional has not. A surprisingly dogmatic approach to technology development (ML models for everything!) restricts the pace of advancement and makes for endless headaches on the part of Validation and test teams. Because Motional has only now begun really investing in commercial partnerships (the prior deployment in Las Vegas was really treated as a side show in a lot of ways), it has relatively informal and lax practices and policies around public-facing operations (though, it should be said, not with respect to safety). The extraordinarily conservative nature of the product design (a safety driver AND a safety operator in every vehicle) makes the path to driverless - a goal toward which all AV companies are working - a steep one, even relative to industry peers. The biggest con, in my opinion, is that the lack of structure creates a lot of confusion and churn, and then an incredible amount of duplicated work. It also leads to strained relationships across functions, when the work one group does is not adequately communicated to another, and then priorities/work/finished product conflicts."

- flexible work arrangements
- colleagues are mostly congenial though company culture dictates a certain amount of competition which makes collaboration difficult.","There are many reasons not to consider IDC as a potential employer or a reason to leave it for that matter. Two general reasons come immediately to mind: 

1) reticence to change
2) increasingly outdated business model. 

There are too many specifics to cover in this field but if you'd like to step back into the research days of yesteryear, perhaps IDC is the place for you. Management laziness / ineptitude and the internal politics of the company means change of the smallest variety is the exception and painful at best.

As a result, IDC is a highly inefficient place where menial tasks are unnecessarily difficult because management refuses to acknowledge the opportunity costs and lost productivity that are the result of dated tools (expense reimbursement, information management) and processes. As one reviewer noted, poorly-designed organizational structure and processes does not equate to an entrepreneurial culture. It just means things take an unusually long time to get done.

Also, good luck with career advancement which is an opaque process at best. Career progression usually happens in one of three ways:

1) Backstabbing. Many that climb the IDC ladder, where rungs aren't always visible, have been known to do so by nefarious means. 
2) Attrition. Hang in there long enough and there's a good chance some exasperated soul in the lower to middle rungs of the company will run away screaming leaving an opening for some unfortunate soul.
3) Leave and come back. Strangely, this is a celebrated part of IDC's stale culture. It's not unusual for talented people to rightly leave the company and come back after management wakes up to the fact the person or people in question were undervalued. If they bit their lips during their initial / previous stint with the company, management sometimes employs them again albeit at a higher level. (great way to encourage the rank and file to stay the course by the way).

For a company that is purportedly global, IDC is embarrassingly U.S. and Framingham centric. To be fair, more attention is being paid by some in senior ranks to China and other higher growth markets (imagine!) as lower American growth has caught up to the company. 

IDC will exist so long as the brand is respected within the ranks of the old information technology vendor guard. But if IDC continues along its current path, employee attrition will rise and college students will learn about this once highly-respected company in 20 to 30 years time in the many great nearby business schools."

First, as you scroll through, notice something about these UKG reviews… the (many) negative one-star reviews tend to be long and full of detail, whereas the five-star “Great company!” reviews tend to be one-liners and worded the same, e.g. “None at this time” for negatives. See the pattern?
Don’t be fooled. Ignore the planted click-farm reviews and you’ll see UKG as the toxic company it has become.
I worked for Ultimate for over a decade and it was, by far, the greatest company I’d ever worked for. After the merger it became unbelievably toxic. Every really talented and enthusiastic person in my department—every single one—had either quit in disgust or been driven out. Be aware that management is outsourcing your code to India as fast as they can. 
Now, what if you’re a potential customer and you like the idea of your payroll provider being “lean and mean”? Know this: UKG’s Salesforce system shows a satisfaction rating for every customer: green and everything is good; yellow means the customer is upset, red means the customer is *really* angry and is actively planning to jump. In the Ultimate days to see even a single red was a rarity. Shortly before I got the hell out of UKG, I was assigned twelve projects, and out of the twelve *eleven* of them were red. Think about *that* when you’re recommending UKG to your boss."

Recently, all employees under Sarrazin, including those hired fully remote, or hybrid remote, were given 30-days notice before being required to begin working from the office or they would ""auto-resign"". They set the distance from the office at 50 miles! So, they honestly expect people to drive 100-miles per day. Some people have expressed concern with what would be a 90-minute commute, each way and the financial problems that would impact people who were hired to be fully remote. The official position of UKG was effectively: ""So what?"" In my opinion, the management of UKG is now focused on taking the company public, and to that end, they will step on as many necks as needed to cash out. My advice, don't be suckered by the previous reputation of Ultimate Software, Kronos, of the UKG.

UKG,5.0,"Feb 28, 2024",Jump On In; the Water is Just Right  :-),Payroll Representative III,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Alpharetta, GA","There really is a pretty strong list of pros for working at UKG. When I started, I was making the switch from 13 years within the hotel industry. As much as I loved working in hotels, there were certain needs that were being neglected that I have found within UKG.
1) The work-life balance is awesome! Since joining UKG, I have worked under the leadership of four different managers. Never once have any of them made me feel guilty for having to take my children to the doctor, or attending one of their midday school functions. Thus far, my experience has been that as long as the job itself is getting done, there aren't any worries. They understand and acknowledge that we all have lives outside of the job, and they encourage us to make sure that that outside life is just as productive and healthy as our professional lives.
2) The lists of benefits that UKG offers to Ukrewers is amazing! In no particular order, and definitely not covering all of them: a) 100% covered medical and dental for you and your family b) unlimited PTO c) depending on your position, the ability to work from home d) Tuition reimbursement (which I am taking advantage of myself) e) their 401K match is insane as of right now. These are just a few, but I guarantee there are many more
3) If payroll is a new endeavor for you, like it was for me, please know that the Rising Stars program will give you everything you need to set you up for success in the industry. Beyond the Rising Stars program, UKG still offers great training options at any time.
4) Inclusivity: If there is anything about yourself that you feel people might wrongfully judge or condemn you over, don't worry about that when you come into UKG. There are various things about my own self that I've experienced negative backlash over within previous companies: my hair, clothes, facial hair, lingo and even the neighborhood I come from. Don't worry about experiencing that here. In fact, UKG offers and encourages Ukrewers to get involved with one or more of the various available ERGs that have developed. In these groups, we foster love and pride for those things that some in society would rather condemn and alienate.","There aren't too many cons that I can mention, and I promise that I am trying. My first is only a con depending on your point of view.
1) If you are new to the industry and company, the amount of things you must learn in what feels like short amount of time can seem overwhelming. Even managers who have been in payroll for years admit that they are still learning new things everyday. This industry comes with challenges and learning curves, and you have to be prepared to adjust to those. This requires an ability to focus on the task at hand, thoroughness in your work, and the humility to know when to ask for help. Once again, there are numerous trainings and resources to help you grow, and I haven't met one person who hasn't been willing to assist when needed. Your ability to overcome the challenges is completely in your hands.
2) I work in a Hybrid position which means we come in 3 days of the week, and stay home the other 2. The Payroll Representative position is one that can be done completely remote. On top of that, I have found that my most productive days are those where I do stay home, because I will work straight through the day. My office space is right next to the kitchen and bathroom, so I can get up and be back in two minutes. My children's school is less than 5 minutes from my house, so I can pick them up in 10-15 minutes. When I go into the office, it is between an hour and hour and thirty minutes drive there and back. I have to drop the kids off in the morning, and pick them up in the middle of the day. This is a lot of time I feel could be used towards productivity. Because of this, I find myself trying to schedule my worksite days to be the least busy. Outside of the issue of productivity, the office is beautiful and modern, and it's always great to get out of the house and truly work alongside my colleagues."

- Co-workers were truly some of the best people I've ever worked with (excluding some I will mention later)","I will lead off with I have no ill will toward UKG and left under good terms. I left because I was stuck working 70 hours a week to keep up and my health started suffering.

I have never seen two top tier cultures with Ultimate Software and Kronos get destroyed so quickly. Kronos leadership effectively took over after the merge and quickly ignored suggestions from Ultimate leadership. Most of the Kronos leadership went to the same handful of business schools in the northeast and were all taught the same things and there was zero creativity in decision making or diversity of thought. Everyone in senior and executive leadership is in lock step with each other, because they are afraid to push back against their managers for fear of being fired. Being privy to meetings that involved senior and executive leadership, poor outcomes from poor decision making often leads to some poor director or VP being scapegoated and fired. This culture of fear trickles down and if you are a dissenting voice, your job is at risk.

Speaking of poor decision making, too many decisions are made without full understanding of the outcome. They laid off all of the customer relationship people, because ""on paper"" it looked like they did a job redundant to our support managers. However, no one actually bothered to ask what they actually did. I was in a meeting with a senior leader who flat out said they made a huge mistake with that decision. Internal process decisions have also been made without understanding the other side of the business. I won't give an example, because internal processes should remain internal. 

Also in many of these meetings, it is apparent that at least half of these leaders, if not more, whole heartedly believe that every front line employee is replaceable. That frontline engineer that designed and built a piece of the software and new all the ins and outs, who cares if we lay that person off, someone else can do that same job cheaper. That support person who has worked within the product for 7 years and knows it like the back of their hand, a kid fresh out of college can do that job with the same effectiveness for cheaper. There's a lot of smiles and false masks put on when they speak to front line employees, but I am absolutely disgusted by what some of them think about their employees. There are departments where this isn't an issue, but its mostly EPIC and support. They have internal surveys and every survey from the last two years, the lowest ratings are always about executive leadership. 

Just comment about benefits here. This past year it was announced that they could fund the 100% employer paid insurance for at least 2 more years. Insurance has gotten worse over the last few years, but I anticipate employees having to pay something after that 2 year mark. Salaries are lower than industry standard for many positions and benefits are keeping many people there."

To go from truly being one of the best companies I have ever worked for to one of the worst is an understatement. Leadership is being taken over by Kronos leaders and not all of them are bad but they all have an ADP feel and sadly, it is much worse than ADP ever was. When I was hired at Ultimate i was told they would never do lay offs. Well UKG has now done two rounds of layoffs and it is heartbreaking. They took away every perk imaginable and no one cares at all. This is one of the worse companies in my career but not because of what I went through at Ultimate, But what I have gone through as a UKG Employee. Kronos was handed a golden egg and they have done an outstanding job of making it rotten.

Imagine having a manager with 11 years of experience with the company and all they have to show for it is incompetent leadership by forwarding issues to those under them. Why have Support Managers if they just use the same copy/paste templates on cases and send them off to a representative? Not to mention not checking cases, even upper management doesn’t do since “jUST cAlL tHe CuStOmEr aNd ClOsE tHe LoOp” will solve anything.

Calling every single customer will not resolve the issue. Me having to send another email from the case itself regarding a resolution/update does nothing but time waste. You managers have access to SF, use it for updates. I don’t have to send separate emails for every escalation when they have been notified on SF. Managers won’t even listen to you, they will repeat the same thing over and over for thirty minutes straight in each one-on-one meeting.

One goes to upper management for issues of how their managers grossly leads the team, two months later they are back at it again with the same actions.

This company cares more about the customer that you. United, Kind, and Growing, is a complete lie and a fraud. They will overwork you to the bone and set unrealistic numbers each month for production.

They don’t care about us, only to bend over backwards for incompetent customers who skipped every training and articles sent to them.

The company culture, while still very positive, has taken a hit because of their increased focus on money. Also, there has been layoffs recently which has cut a considerable portion of the company and there are concerns about job security.

UKG,5.0,"Jan 26, 2024",Start up vibe....with 70+ years of experience,Vice President of Sales,"Current Employee, more than 8 years",,"There's a whole lot to love at UKG. 

I've been in the HCM software industry for close to 25 years and 10 of those years have been with UKG. During that time I've seen the inner workings of lots of companies. What struck me 10 years ago when I joined Ultimate Software (the ""U"" in UKG) was how deeply everyone cared about our company, our customers and each other. When we were brought private via PE and later merged with Kronos (the K in UKG), I definitely had some reservations. Would the culture remain the same? Would people still care? Now that we're 3+ years post merger I'm so happy to say that nothing has changed, we're simply bigger, with even more to offer our employees and customers. 

The secret is the senior leaders. Everyone at UKG has the ability to have a relationship with the C suite and in my role as VP I'm fortunate enough to have quite a lot of exposure to them. They are the reason we continue to grow the product, perfect the service and take care of our people like family along the way. When the entire C Suite is in the same boat rowing the same way it's easy to to be excited as an employee and especially as a leader. They communicate well with me and I can communicate well with my team. They know where we are, where we're going and give us everything we need to do our jobs and create great relationships internally as well as externally. They treat us ALL like family andf that means a lot to me.

That said, by far my favorite part of working at UKG is when the following situation happens (which it does frequently): I'm in public with my UKG golf shirt on and someone says ""do you work for UKG?"". In past roles outside of UKG that question would make me nervous and maybe even a little ashamed. Now that I'm here at UKG I have no nerves becuase I know what is comming when I say ""yes...I work at UKG"". Without question the person will respond with something like ""we use UKG and I love it"" then the person pulls out their mobile phone to show me the app my team sells that they use every day. Other common responses are ""I've always wanted to work there..."" or ""my friend works there and loves it...do you know ______?"". The common theme is that the responses are always positive and always make me proud of what I do for a living.

If you want to go to bed feeling good about what you do...UKG is a great place for you!","Depending on who you are as a person and what you like, I guess you could say there's a lot of work to do here and everyone is very busy. For me, I actually like that but I can appreciate not all people are wired like me and want such a fast pace. It feels very much like a startup here, even though it's a very mature and well established company. For me, I welcome the challenge...my days go by fast and I never get bored. Again, some folks may like a slower pace and less work but to me...that would be like sitting in detention (not that I would know....well...maybe)...I say bring on the work and fast pace...lets go do something amazing with your career!"

The entire ordeal left me with a bitter taste in my mouth, highlighting the company's abysmal handling of employee matters, an out-of-touch CEO, and an overall toxic corporate culture.

Let's start with the layoff process. The way it was executed demonstrated a complete lack of empathy and professionalism. Employees were treated like mere numbers on a spreadsheet rather than individuals with families, livelihoods, and aspirations. The callousness displayed during this time was shocking, leaving many talented and dedicated professionals blindsided and without a clear understanding of why their contributions were deemed expendable."

The current CEO has not had much success. Great person but he’s changed. The CFO brought in had a reputation for cutting to raise the stock price and is doing the same here. Both the CFO and CEO have their million shares, so they see the cuts in a positive light as the stock rises. They’re just disconnected. Can’t blame ‘em. Blinded by money. As others have said, the cuts weren’t based on performance. That makes it worse for employees, with no one secure in their job.

The experience of these layoffs was deeply distressing, particularly for those impacted in the R&D development team. Layoffs, when conducted fairly and transparently, can be understandable in certain scenarios—such as performance-based reasons or during mergers and acquisitions—provided employees are given ample notice. However, the manner in which these layoffs were executed warrants further discussion, as it left employees in both the United States and India in a state of shock and anxiety. The layoffs occurred twice in 2023, first at the beginning of the year and again in November. The suddenness of these actions, devoid of any prior information or clues, took employees by surprise, with emails sent just minutes after company-wide announcements, determining their employment fate. This abruptness caused widespread panic among the workforce, leaving individuals scrambling to understand their next steps. Employees who received layoff emails found their computer access revoked and their workstations wiped clean. Managers were directed not to take calls from affected employees. In the aftermath, the company's offices remained closed for 15 days, further unsettling the workforce. The repercussions of these abrupt layoffs were far-reaching, affecting individuals with varying tenures, from newcomers to those with decades of service ex: 24 years of experience within the company. Navigating the job market during the holiday season added an additional layer of hardship to those already reeling from the sudden upheaval. Furthermore, within the organization, reports of favoritism and group dynamics have cast a shadow over trust and fairness, particularly within the R&D team and leadership. Allegations of bias based on race or region have added to the distressing narrative. Witnessing colleagues lose their jobs in an instant, seeing their struggles during the holiday season to secure new employment, has been a painful and unsettling experience. Many affected individuals are immigrants, facing timelines and legal constraints in their job search. These developments have shaken the foundation of trust within the organization, eroding confidence in the leadership's vision, which appears to prioritize swift full-time employee terminations without adequate notice. It gives rise to second thoughts about recommending Informatica as a workplace. In closing, the lack of advance notification for these layoffs has compounded the distress. Employees who dedicated their time and effort to the company deserved a more considerate and empathetic approach during these challenging times. As a result, I hesitate to endorse working at Informatica, especially within the R&D team."

Long-term employees within Informatica tend to be more generous with help than what I've observed in other companies. Change is encouraged, along with seeking out constant improvement.","Internally, there may be too much permissiveness in letting teams self-direct their projects and programs. There is duplication in roles, internal tools, and projects because leadership doesn't back a single, company-wide solution. Surprisingly, too little top-down direction can lead to inefficient decision-making a resource assignment. Also, much of the company's employee moral boosting efforts are negated by hasty decisions to perform layoffs."

-There are lot of people who don't care about their jobs supporting sales
-Whole-sale decisions are made without including a steering committee inclusive of everyone. The most recent of moving to industry vertical dramatically changed the work lives of many sellers and splintered relationships with customers

It has also been exciting being part of a company that just went public.",There haven't been enough cloud native projects to use skills and customers seem to be stuck on premises.

Some of this can be attributed their history of acquisitions, requiring engineering effort to integrate. But a reliance on legacy successes may have made them complacent.

Informatica,5.0,"Sep 30, 2022",A company that values its employees and the work is good too,Consultant,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",,"Benefits
* Good pay (it was miles ahead of other ranges when I was job searching). This may be a con for you but there is an incentive bonus for hitting a certain percentage of billable time. I personally like that if I put the work in I get more money.
* Can work fully remote
* As of the end of 2022 still not much travel required, but that may change
* Stock options
* Flexible Time Off - the benefit of this is you never have to worry about running out of sick days and you get to access vacation time immediately

Culture
* The culture is fairly progressive
* I like my manager
* Generally everyone I meet is pleasant to work with and competent

Growth opportunities
* You can specialize in what you want. There are many products offered that have a different skillsets and challenges to go with them. You can mix and match. Learning new products is encouraged.
* IPS (consultants) Management that I've interacted with has a view of maximizing growth and helping employees build their brand. 
* Networking and grabbing (virtual) coffee is encouraged.

The work
* The fact that you can focus on what product you want and get to work with many different clients keeps the work fresh and exciting.","* Flexible Time Off - there are restrictions around it. Only a certain percentage of the team can be approved for vacation at the same time, which makes the holidays a little tricky. To offset this sometimes the company grants time off to everyone between Xmas and New Years. Also there is a soft cap at 3 weeks. Any time off beyond that needs additional approval.
*Healthcare is just pretty standard, but it has options. Though I came from a company with a very generous healthcare benefit so I may be biased.

Culture
*There is a lot of talking in corporate buzzwords at the C-suite level. It's just not my thing.
*Sometimes different teams seem siloed in their individual focuses, which may don't always work seamlessly together.

The work
* There is a focus on hitting your allocated hours which can sometimes get in the way of just doing your job."

Informatica,1.0,"Feb 25, 2022",Micro managers R US (and we've got spreadsheets to prove it!),Developer,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"It's a funny company, Informatica. They like to make money. Lots of money. Which is good for the board members, managers, and favorites. You like that? Go for it.
They talk about diversity. They are super-woke these days. If you like that, it's a great place for you!
Good place for beginners to get started. (Then get out.)","The biggest con? They do not keep money promises to employees. Not salary, not bonus, not stock, not perks. None of it. (Unless maybe if you are one of the favorites. And you will KNOW who the favorites are. It is obvious.) They'll make you think they will pay up. But they won't. And you will be shocked at how they get away with it. Cost of living?? Please.
In the last few years, they made plenty of money. LOTS of money. Yet did not pay full bonuses (always an excuse!) and pathetic (or no!) raises. There are PLENTY of companies out there who pay bonuses as promised and give decent raises. Informatica is NOT one you can trust in this dept. Oh but they will make you believe they really are not like that ... trust them. Good luck with that.
When they reopen the office, you'll see how ""diverse"" they really are. It is a company of EASILY 85%+ Indian people. Which is fine with me. I like Indian people and the culture. What I do NOT like is the pretense that this is diverse. It is not. Never has been. 
What else is funny? They are closet conservatives. Love that."
