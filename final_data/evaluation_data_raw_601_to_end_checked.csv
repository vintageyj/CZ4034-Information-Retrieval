essentially a hush contract which would have nullified my rights to speak or write of any of what is here the contents of the contract or even the contract itself this would also apply to my family as

offer any input leaving me to conceptualize the scope for each bimonthly project on my own he neither supports nor opposes any proposals i put forward if i succeed he takes credit if i fail its on me throughout this period he hasnt contributed anything he doesnt assess my work independently but relies on the opinions of people from a parallel department resources are always said to be in the process of negotiation but in reality they are not provided ive interviewed dozens of candidates and some promising ones get stuck when they reach him i dont understand why if were not hiring why wasting so much time of mine the recruiters and the candidates i have no idea what hes busy with he has never produced any results himself when asked he claims other areas need him to put out fires 2 clearly lacking topdown direction manager a says i lack entrepreneurship at this point my mind is clear and i find it amusing i manage four or five projects simultaneously discovering opportunities designing and executing them on my own yet he says i lack entrepreneurship 3 for the past halfyear ive been working overloaded 1416 hours a day being in the us west coast i need to collaborate with teams in china attending meetings at 530 am 630 am and often extending meetings until at least 10 pm during weekdays meetings frequently go into the early hours of the morning and i still have to do my own work afterward 4 after more than half a year manager a brings in manager b this person has no relevant experience whatsoever not even remotely related 5 i end up tutoring b for almost a month explaining the situation to them i dont want to dwell on why this person became my boss im just relieved to have someone to share the workload 6 a month later i ask b about her plans for my work as my boss b says just go with the flow take it easy then she turn around and tell manager a that im not in good shape not actively working 7 b assigns me to lead a project lets call it project z anyone with experience would know this project is impossible to complete during the planning phase i point out that both internal and external conditions for this project are not mature suggesting we wait until they are more favorable b insists on proceeding since b doesnt listen to advice i reluctantly follow her instructions and the results are naturally not satisfactory later two different people took over project z one resigns after a few weeks and the other transferred to a different team its clear that the insistence on doing project z was a and bs problem eventually project z becomes the sole basis for b to claim that my judgment is lacking 8 b openly wants me to leave the reason is my team cannot have two senior people and the next day she said my team can have two senior people but you are not suitable however due to visa issues i cant resign immediately so im witness some more horror 9 my relationship with the counterpart team has always been good this is why even when it was tough i persisted in this position before b arrived one day b requests that i stop having oneonone meetings with people from the counterpart team she told me dont attend these meetings but those were meetings organized by me and dont have oneonones with xx 10 after another month both managers along with hr tell me that my performance is poor the main accusations are lack of judgment and trust with the collaborating team cannot be repaired at this point because i havent had direct contact with the collaborating team for over a month i start doubting myself after talking to several people from the collaborating team i realize that this is completely baseless nonsense 11 b says i have a perfectionist tendency and am not suitable for this environment unable to come up with anything substantial they repeatedly criticize my personality making vague and ambiguous remarks when i ask for specific workrelated examples they accuse me of being defensive attacking my attitude attacking my personality refusing to discuss work,Negative,

some time now and its safe to say that a lot has changed since i first walked through those doors its been a journey filled with ups and downs and id like to share my perspective lets start with the positives if youre fortunate enough to have a good manager consider yourself lucky they can be your guiding light in an organization that often seems to have lost its way however the management style in general tends to lean heavily towards micromanagement which can be stifling and counterproductive at times its hard to thrive when you constantly feel like someone is looking over your shoulder pushing you for more even when youre already outperforming your peers one of the most significant issues ive observed is the sheer number of initiatives the company pursues simultaneously while ambition is admirable it often feels like a scattered approach where resources and attention are spread too thin it can be challenging to excel in an environment where youre expected to juggle so many tasks and it sometimes feels like a lack of clear direction furthermore theres been a noticeable shift in the companys priorities we used to have a budget allocated for partner meetings and inoffice engagement which contributed to a sense of camaraderie and motivation however thats no longer the case despite the companys financial success its disheartening to see such perks vanish when the company is more prosperous than ever it leaves employees feeling undervalued and disconnected from the companys overall success in conclusion working for this company has been a mixed experience the presence of a good manager can make all the difference but the prevailing micromanagement style an overwhelming number of initiatives and the loss of budget for partner meetings and inoffice

promotions and advancement work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time but very few of them if you do whats expected youll be fine at least for a handful of years working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible and many people do it there are also people who are hypermotived and work like crazy just because they love it or because theyre competitive or they want to get a promotion if you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra youll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still and maybe that doesnt matter so it works out for everybody but at least know where you would realistically stand if you excel and work your butt off youll be compensated and promoted if you let yourself be a code monkey and just sit coding with your head down all day youll be fine but wont advance a big complaint from some googlers is about not being able to advance even at google with pure

the number of bad apples grows as a percentage its supposedly the same as it ever was but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just feels like things might be changing for the worse also with growth means more internalconfidential data leaks again because of the raw numbers of people product announcements being ruined etc that means the company has to be tighterlipped internally to avoid leaks which makes things less open its still an amazingly open place but less so than it was even a couple years ago the good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things
