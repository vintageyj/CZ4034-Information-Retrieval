The experience for software managers and engineers is all over the board, from really run low operational load teams to teams where people burn out after a year.

 - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian.  You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived.  You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned.  There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long.
  - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue)
  - A chance to make a huge difference
  - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself
  - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions).
  - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain","- You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that.
- Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today.  It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.

I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone."
Amazon,5,23-Feb-18,An Amazing Place to Work,Software Development Manager,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Phoenix, AZ","I've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction.

The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.","No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that.

Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse."

Amazon,4,23-Mar-17,We are now in a world where we are condescended to by our inferiors,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Seattle, WA",This company gets A list performance from C list employees.  The culture is quick and hard charging.  You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.,"Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways.

Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey.  This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon.  The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people.""

The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism.  Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street."

Amazon,4,19-Sep-14,A huge diverse high tech company with all sorts of stuff,Software Development Engineer,Current Employee,"Seattle, WA","Disclaimer: My opinions reflect that of an SDE in Amazon. Seems like some operational job functions are very tough.

I have read through some of the other Amazon reviews and it seems to me that everyone has a very different experience! This is so true. Within the same team, you can have both workaholics and slackers coexisting and coworking together. I think I am more of the balanced type as I try to stay sane. The Amazon experience is basically the entire spectrum and it is what you make it out to be.

Pros in Amazon certainly excludes great benefits, but compensation is competitive. Free food means average quality free coffee, once in a while free pizza for lunch where it is a working lunch, and free beer and finger food in special events. We get a free Orca card to take any bus in the Seattle area for free. $160 per month subsidy for office parking, which is better than nothing. Downtown monthly parking goes for about $200 per month. 401K contribution is 50% of what you put in, where you can put in max 4% of your salary. Not so great. Staff cafeteria food is average and not at all cheaper than outside food, or could be even more expensive. It is hard not to complain about the cafeteria. Vacation days are ok but note that there are no sick leaves. They count as part of your 5 personal days per year. Listing the benefits of Amazon is like listing the cons and not the pros.

Work life balance seems to be ok for the most part, and seems to be individually-driven. No one will tell you that you have to come in at what time and stay till what time. I have team mates working every night and weekend, and others getting in at 10am and leaving at 5pm, all in the same team. Managers will focus on your project deliveries instead of how much time you spend working. If you work 40-hour weeks productively, you can definitely outperform someone who works 60-hour weeks but don't deliver stuff. Working less than 40 hours per week is somewhat common, but I can't say how many people are working how long. The view on work life balance is a bit skewed. All it comes down to are the managers and what they think. Projects are always never-ending but I have found that deadlines are very realistic and reasonable, without counting your nights and weekends. Getting some slack time once in a while is probably a sign of a healthy work environment. Everyone needs a break.

On-call really really sucks. Basically all it comes down to is having SDEs double-duty as support operations engineers. Note that on-call does not improve the code quality of any team in any way. The on-call experience is particularly bad because you are using services from some other team, and their code is of low quality and fails for the wrong reasons. If the managers had given more time to up the quality, there would not be so many problems. Software is usually delivered with a tough deadline with code that meets the minimum quality bar and never gets improved for the next few years. The code review process does not seem to help improve the code but it really obstructs developers from making great changes as unconventional things will not pass code review in clumsy minds. Innovation and excellence are not the name of the game in Amazon. Searching through the Amazon code base is usually not going to turn up quality code that you can actually reuse.

Integration is the name of the game in Amazon. You will need to spend a lot of time to figure out how to integrate your code with another team's services. Whether these other people are cooperative is a hit-or-miss. I have found that most people are responsive and helpful, but there are also quite a number of jerks who are out to make trouble for everybody. It is not easy to work across teams but the experience is mostly positive.

Amazon is a huge behemoth and is hiring people like there is no tomorrow. This reflects well on a good growth momentum but also is worrying that the company is not turning much profit. If the company does not make money, where is our bonus going to come from? You can see new faces around the Amazon building almost everyday! Downside is that we are taking in a lot of average to above-average engineers and being an Amazonian SDE certainly does not share the same reputation as the top names. Amazon is a huge mixed bag of some very talented people and some very dumb people. I think the world is not turning up enough SDEs and the only way is for quality to go downhill.

As an SDE, expect to spend most of your time talking, writing emails and documents, and maybe around 20-30% of your time coding. In most of the teams, you can work on interesting projects, but probably not revolutionary ones. Note that Amazon is a very down-to-earth company and the work is very down-to-earth as well. You will work on real things that people have actually requested for, and that people will start using as soon as you are done. Work is challenging but not to expect highly technically complex stuff. Most of the work has to do with solving everyday problems. To me, this seems to make sense because I have ever tried working on experimental projects before elsewhere and I did not feel it was a good use of my time.

Internal mobility is a key strength of Amazon, and I am not sure which company has done better than Amazon in this aspect. Internal moves are easy. You only need to stay in your team for a year before moving to a different team. There is no easy way to tell which team is a good team to move to because they all have their different pros and cons and people and coming and leaving all the time!

Seattle is by much rumour an easier place to live than the Bay area.

Overall Amazon is a tough but yet sane place to work. The flexibility of this company is really its core strength. You have the freedom to excel as much as you want and also to slack as much as you want. Bummer. You shouldn't be slacking!","Beware of bad managers and horrible team mates. They are not specific to Amazon but they do exist in Amazon.

I have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office. I don't know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays.

Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.

Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.

SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else.

Employee retention is horrible. I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources. Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible. This basically mean that either you are a superstar in the company before they will try to retain you, or if you are smart you should not stay in Amazon for too long."
Amazon,4,15-May-17,"Warehouse associate, full time for over two years",Tier I Warehouse Associate,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Carlisle, PA","Great starting pay and the ability to get raises very quickly. Full training in all areas are offered and if your willing to work hard and sweat everyday for 10 hours a day, 4 days a week, then this is the job for you.

Beat benefits as well once you are a hired on as a full time employee.","After 3 years of working with the company you ""cap out"" at $15.75, meaning you can no longer make any more money than that as a tier 1 associate.

They cycle you between different positions in the warehouse so you're not stuck with one that you hate forever

The fast pace of the work doesn't slow down for you -- you have to keep up; it's a bit like being on a treadmill
The culture and expectation is that as a worker, you will comply; this isn't bad in itself because receiving orders in a chain of command is good; but there is little ""freedom"" in this job; in some jobs, you're given a responsibility with some freedom in how you pursue it (like a project or something), but the nature of the work in this position is that you are pretty much bound to do what you're told

Amazon,4,30-Jan-24,"Amazon does real engineering, but it's often a pressure cooker, and you're often just a number",Senior Software Quality Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","North Reading, MA","Amazon in North Reading is a pretty good engineering environment with decent management.

There are opportunities to work on a variety of projects and interesting HW and SW.

Projects are often well funded.
Ideas are generally welcomed and often lead to new projects.

Good benefits.

Collaboration is promoted and supported.

A good place to learn.","You'll often feel like a number as Amazon, which can sometimes treat people like a body in a slot. And HR feels very impersonal and is not known to speak up for employees against management,

It's often a pressure cooker with tight deadlines and unrealistic goals.
In many offices people don't know each other and there's not much camaraderie, culture or community. (North Reading is generally better than most Amazon offices, with a lively social culture, but it's getting to be more impersonal over time.)

Employees are secretly stack-ranked against each other by management. (They usually deny this, but I've had it confirmed by several managers and it's been written up on the net extensively.) This can lead to high-achievers suddenly being put on unrealistic PIPs (Performance Improvement Plans), leading to job loss. (Very few people survive the PIP process, which looks designed to push the person out.)

Most members of SW engineering teams are required to participate in on-call duty, which often means multiple days of 24 hour support every few weeks."

Great place to learn and get your foot in the door for IT.","The workload ramped up tremendously after a while with no extra pay. The supporting of multiple buildings was introduced the past year. Two years ago, it was a great place to get promoted. Now, it's difficult to get promoted without being buddies with upper management. They promote the wrong people who display little to no expertise while others have it or the certifications to prove themselves and who want to move up. Very disorganized and clueless management who cannot agree on anything and forget conversations or messages almost immediately. No backbone from management in upholding tickets and projects SLAs. Expect to bend over for anything operation management demands like a toddler throwing a tantrum and your own bosses yelling at you to get it done even if it goes against the ticket or project policies. Lack of building knowledge past your level and not growing. Basically it becomes a dead-end job. Get in for about a year and get out FAST!

I was gaslighted when I asked to return to the role I was hired for, saying I agreed to take on this role permanently, when the original agreement was they would hire someone specifically with matching experience. This is common at Amazon from what I hear. Management only cares about their own promo and will throw anyone under the bus as needed, don’t be fooled."

Can be as social as you want as long as you get your work done. Easy to be asocial as well if you're more introverted. Take advantage of your benefits; go to school with Career Choice, get braces/invisalign or dental work done if you need it, insurance is top tier for an entry level grunt type of job so if you need medical procedures get them done while working here. Coming from retail, I love not having to deal with customers.",Hard on the body and mind. Prepare to come home emotionally tired and physically sore until you get used to working here. Peak (Nov-Dec) will have you working 50-55 hour weeks every week. Expect to see favoritism and cliques that get special treatments and hook ups.

My building recently went through a change and they ended up cleaning house on most of our bosses, L6+. 
Amazon can be a very cut throat work environment, best advice I can give is to just keep your head down, do your work, and engage your team. Need to make sure your team respects you/ likes working for you. Without the respect of your team, you will never make it.","Too many cons to share. 
There are political games that are played at all levels. Like I said earlier, keep your head down, do your work, and earn the respect of your team. 2x times as hard to build a bridge that has already been burned."
Amazon,4,6-Dec-23,Tenured Amazonian,Finance Manager,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Seattle, WA",I worked at Amazon for almost 8 years and one thing about my experience is that no two days were the same. I loved the challenge of problem solving with the Fay 1 mentality and model. The pay is great and PTO and benefits are top tier. Amazon has a ton of resources and vendor relationships so it was great to take advantage of certain perks like free movie screenings and discounted car rentals. One of the best parts of working at Amazon is the ability to rotate to different teams- which helps avoid cultural adaptations when transferring companies. Most people who work at the Company are self driven and easy to work with.,"Although the pay is extremely good you definitely pay for it with your time. My first two years I was consistently pulling 12-14 hour days on average. Which leads me to my next con- the amount of accounting work that had to be completed manually was unbelievable. Even worse, the businesses were not properly supporting backend functions with reliable systems to track all transactions. This led to way more work for the accountants in assessing completeness and accuracy and more “tech debt” we were being tasked to resolve. Lastly, although benefits are pretty good at Amazon there’s a significant flaw in the sabbatical policy which discourages some of the most tenured employees from taking much needed breaks."

Employees with accommodations can be sent home due to the fault of person responsible for programming software to recognize and execute accommodation orders, not doing so, which results in loss of pay to the employee."

Good amount of leave and vacation. 10 hr shifts so you only work 4 days. Overtime is available sometimes and is 10 hrs so you get good pay those days. Pay increases are good every 6 months until 2 year. Education benefits of $5250/year.,Stowing is very boring a lot of accuracy and rate parameters you have to meet or you will get a write up.

If you have a sense of urgency, desire to learn, and are happy to clock in more than 10k-15k steps a day, you'll do fine here.",The flex drivers program is a bust. Everyday is a challenge with the drivers and the company doesn't give you any support. Amazon warehouses also like to hire from the corporate office and they often get placed ahead of people who have years of experience and are completely lost when it comes to production. The same people will tell you how to do your job but never used a pallet jack in their life.

-The lay-offs over the last year have everyone in recruitment walking on egg shells that there will be more lay offs, do not feel like we have job security
- Pay starting out was good, but once your bonus drops off and they dont increase your base, and stock price is very low, you are not making what was promised/explained to you when you took the job.
- getting promoted up a level is the only way to get a significant pay bump and it is way harder to get promoted up a level then they make it seem like in the beginning so while you are paid well, you wont see large advancements in salary unless promoted"

- You can talk to HR directly if you have an issue! You don't even have to wait 20+ minutes on the phone: there are stations right there in the warehouse where you can talk to a representative!
- 4 10-hour days, so you get an extra day off
- Starting pay is $17.25, which is an increase from when I last worked there, and I'm seasonal","- On the flip side, 4 10-hour days is long and exhausting
- Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance is not the greatest, though Amazon offers a tax-favorable Health Savings Account (90 days for Seasonal, 30 or 60 days for full-time, but none for Reduced- (30 hours/week required) or Part-Time (4-6/week required, I don't remember)
- You walk into hiring, wait in a line (there's usually a lot of people in there), you turn in your paperwork that they send through email (with which I've never had an issue), you get your photo ID and drug test, then you set a hire date, which is 2-3 weeks out, so it's a month before you get a paycheck"

- Very rewarding work when able to do things the way you feel is correct.
- Self-guided growth opportunities and ability to do as much work as you're wanting to do.","- Inconsistencies based off of regional guidance which varies.
- Favoritism is rampant for growth in the sense that you can grow extremely quickly under a favored leader but be stunted from another. Your entire performance is based off of 2 annual performance reviews and are FILLED with recency bias. A self-written performance review can be inflated and spoken about as if it were gold.
- Internal pay raises are a joke. Externals get brought on anywhere from $5k - $15k more. 
- PXT (HR) is held to much higher standards and promotions are a lengthy process whereas operators paid more, promoted easier, and given a lot more incentives.
- HR has little growth patterns after layoffs."

The pay is decent, and promotional outlook is decent as well. They gave me a relocation package to help me move. Their ""academy"" gave me the chance to travel to Washington State and Washington D.C. as part of their leadership program before really digging down into the work. A lot of the associates I manage are also fun. I was also given several benefit programs such as medical, dental, life, and 401k. These are not free, but the prices seemed pretty reasonable and were discounted for employees with the company.","Mostly only when things get stressful, upper management tend to lean the blame on me, and there have been instances where they weren't interested to hear what I had to say about the work I'm doing. In these instances, I have often felt like I needed to walk on eggshells, because adding my voice seemed to be unwanted or taken as a challenge rather than the feedback, idea generation, or guidance seeking that it was. This is the exact opposite with my direct managers, however. We are salaried for 10 hour days, but often run over into 12+. Its also a night shift, so be ready to be awake when everyone else is sleeping and visa versa. There will also be associates who are just uninterested in working and will cause headaches or try to weaponize HR if they don't like you for any number of reasons. Its a constant struggle to keep up with the changing demands of doing the same tasks in different ways. I feel like I've had to learn three ways to do the basic functions of my job to satisfy different leadership. Overall, however, this is the best working environment I've been in so far. The toxicity has been minimal, despite my complaining, and there is a lot of support. A month or two ago, I would have said my team was the best part of the job, more-so than the pay or growth opportunities. That has changed however, with some instances that felt downright hostile both from leadership and associates. There's also a million emails a day and a constant stream of data."

IBM,4,26-Aug-14,"Advisory Engineer in STG, IBM",Advisory Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","Hopewell Junction, NY","Disclaimer: A lot of what I'm writing below of course depends on the work area and management chain.  But I found this to be fairly pervasive policies in IBM in my 9+ years with the company. 
1. IBM's policies and management are very flexible when it comes to working remotely or accommodating various life situations (sick days, doctor visits, etc.).  Management is encouraged to measure an employee by their work and impact, and not by hours spent at their office. 
2. Great colleagues!  Though unfortunately, many have been leaving due to the instability of IBM's HW development business. 
3. At least in my area, there's a high level of flexibility on which projects should I undertake based on my and my management assessment of business impact.","1. Unfortunately, IBM still uses the ""normal distribution"" rating system, where at the end of the year each employee is ranked as a top contributor (5%), above average contributor (15%), average contributor (~75%), and bottom contributor (5%).  This curve is difficult to apply in the R&D world, where you may have many members of the team working long and hard hours, and end up being ""average contributors"" at the end of the year, because there just isn't room for all to be top contributors. 

2. The above may not be so disturbing, if only IBM didn't practically cancelled all raises, performance bonuses and incentive for the non top-performers. I've had a consistent ""above average"" rating in the last 4-5 years, and my raise and performance bonus were ridiculous mere 1.5-2% of my salary.  Were I rated ""average contributor"" I would have gotten NOTHING. So you can imagine that people can go year after year without any raise to their salary.

From talking to manager friend, this is IBM's way to eliminate the non-top-performers without having to fire them, as part of its direction of reducing US manpower. 

3. Hiring freeze in many areas - again, as part of IBM's attempt to reduce its workforce across North America and Europe we see many jobs move to the India and Far East markets.  This is of course upsetting to see local teams shrink and disappear, especially when many great local IBM colleagues and experts begin to drop out. From my experience thus far working with India SW teams - they are still very far away from the standards I would have expected from US and Europe based teams. 

4. Poor top down communication about company's and divisions' future.  Employees learn from rumors and news websites what's about to come..."

IBM invests a lot in learning platforms and actively leads important initiatives within the DEI space both internal and external. Ways of working are agile, fast paced, and you learn a lot from colleagues/peers. The environment is very open and collaborative (depending on team/BU). IBM is moving the needle on a lot of new tech initiatives that are impactful for the world, which feels great to be part of that movement.","Top leaders make all the decisions that impact those actually doing the work without ever asking or involving bottom line. At IBM your put on multiple work streams without a clear answer to ""Why are we doing this, what are we solving for, is this really worth our effort"". IBM constantly iterates and renews processes/procedures, without ensuring foundation is solid. Constant innovation and iteration is good but you need to give something enough time to actually see if it works vs constantly changing. There is A LOT of nepotism and because of this only certain people are promoted while others are forgotten about and not taken seriously. Internal mobility is also hard to come by, unless someone leaves a role, or you're a manager 'favourite' you are not getting promoted."

Some employees may feel overwhelmed by the workload and pressure.

Limited Work-Life Balance: In certain roles or during demanding projects, employees might find it challenging to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Long working hours and tight deadlines may contribute to this issue.

Bureaucracy: Large organizations often have established bureaucratic processes, which could lead to delays in decision-making and project execution. Navigating through these processes might be cumbersome for some employees.

Limited Managerial Support: Your experience of feeling overworked without sufficient support from management is a common concern in various workplaces. In a large company, communication channels can sometimes be complex, and individual experiences may differ based on teams and managers.

Emphasis on Metrics: Some employees may feel that the company places a strong emphasis on metrics and performance indicators, which could potentially impact the work environment and stress levels.

Limited Flexibility: Depending on the role and team, some employees might find that the company has a more structured and less flexible approach to work arrangements.

Communication Challenges: In a large organization, communication can sometimes be a challenge. Important information might not always be effectively communicated across teams, leading to misunderstandings or a lack of clarity."
IBM,4,5-Feb-24,Attracting & Retaining Top Talent: Optimizing Expat Benefits at IBM Malaysia,Direct Sales Team Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Petaling Jaya,"IBM is on track to become the top market cap company in the next 6-8 years.

Worked with outstanding people

Learning opportunities","Two key suggestions regarding expat benefits:

1. EPF Contribution for Expat Employees: With IBM Malaysia's rapid expansion and reliance on expat IT talent, I propose implementing an employer contribution to the EPF (Employees' Provident Fund) at the standard rate of 12%, aligning with industry practices. Currently, the RM5 contribution for expat managers falls short compared to the market and competitors like AWS, MS, Google, Veeam, and Cisco who offer full employer contributions as a key talent attraction strategy. This change would enhance competitiveness and employee satisfaction.

2. Improved Insurance Package: Exploring an insurance provider like AIA with a superior user experience and interface could be beneficial. Additionally, incorporating optical benefits would address the needs of many employees experiencing vision issues who currently need to purchase glasses separately. This demonstrates investment in employee well-being and aligns with best practices."

Legacy and Experience: With a history dating back over a century, IBM brings a wealth of experience to the table, which can be advantageous in understanding and addressing complex business challenges.","Challenges in Adaptation: The size and legacy of IBM can sometimes hinder its ability to adapt quickly to rapidly changing technology trends, potentially making it less agile compared to smaller competitors.

Competition: In the highly competitive tech industry, IBM faces stiff competition from other major players, which can impact market share and profitability.

Restructuring and Layoffs: IBM has undergone various restructuring efforts, including layoffs, to streamline its operations. While this is a common practice in the business world, it can impact employee morale and public perception.

Complexity of Offerings: The broad range of products and services offered by IBM may be overwhelming for some clients, and the complexity might lead to challenges in finding the right solutions for specific needs.

Revenue Challenges: IBM has faced revenue challenges in certain quarters, which may be attributed to shifts in technology spending or changes in market demand."

When I joined, I was told about how good the benefits were, and how IBM was a ""family."" In the past few years, that philosophy has been discarded. Every few months upper management makes sweeping policy changes, with no employee input, that significantly hurt US employees. When employees react en masse with concern, alarm, and constructive feedback, they ignore or gaslight us, or commit the strawman fallacy by mischaracterizing employees' concerns and then dismissing them. For example, in November 2023 (right after the employee engagement survey concluded), the did away with 401k matching, replacing it with a novel financial vehicle called an ""RBA"" with much lower yields, and tried to spin it as a good thing for us. Based on publicly available information, I'm estimating that this will probably save IBM at least $100M over the next decade in US benefits payouts. It also means IBM holds our retirement money, rather than the employee. IBM simply does not care about retaining talent right now -- if you are a senior or well-paid employee in the US, they see you as an expense, and they're showing you the door."

There is a general insecurity about where IBM is heading and what we actually do.

The environment rewards short-term deals-for-convenience, rather than an internal sense of mission or conviction. The internal pressure on daily utilisation, cost control and sales cadence calls is relentless. Most of the company’s human capital is burned measuring percentages and the inventing the next quarterly narrative for shareholders, rather than solving meaningful problems for clients, being bold or original."

To help the work environment be more collaborative, it streamlines lots of internal processes to make them more efficient and effective.
There are some effective communication channels between management and employees via instant messaging and online systems. The management can provide feedback to employees on their performance for their self-improvement and growth in their roles.
Also, the company recognizes and rewards employees for their achievements and contributions to the company through a mechanism like currency exchange for gifts and services in loyalty programs.",One thing I would like to suggest IBM improves is offering more flexible work arrangements or other benefits to help employees achieve a better work-life balance.

IBM,4,23-Jan-24,Overall it is a good company,Application Architect,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Hong Kong,"In my experience with IBM, overall, it is a good company, as it provides adequate opportunities for professional development, and keeps promoting a culture of respect, inclusivity, and collaboration in the work environment for employees and different teams in the company. To help the work environment be more collaborative, it streamlines lots of internal processes to make them more efficient and effective.
There are some effective communication channels between management and employees via instant messaging and online systems. The management can provide feedback to employees on their performance for their self-improvement and growth in their roles.
Also, the company recognizes and rewards employees for their achievements and contributions to the company through a mechanism like currency exchange for gifts and services in loyalty programs.",One thing I would like to suggest IBM improves is offering more flexible work arrangements or other benefits to help employees achieve a better work-life balance.

Did you have vacations on those days? Who cares, go and change your plans that managment ask you to save 13 weeks before.
Work phone? What is that? Give your personal number to client so they can call you 24/7. Oh and if you need any help from the owner of the app go call him with your own phone.
They ask you to work 40 hours, and you only register 40 hours. But you are also obligated to work 48 hours if they want. No extra hours payment.
100 dollars penalization, if you don't finish in one month a course they ask you to finish in 4 months ( you can get 6 of them at same time)

SAP training is over-emphasized, but there are few available SAP roles for Associates. Expect to waste your time learning things that will be obsolete by the time you are able to use them.

2) If you are in engine development team and a developer then you are safe here.","1) IBM ISL Kochi is a Hire and Fire Company. They took many floor and hiring many people in Kochi. When we look at the Firing count it is same as hiring count in each year.
2) IBM culture is based on a Manager game. For all other location a technical person become as manager. Unfortunately in Kochi almost every manager is non technical and they will not take any challenging work which make visibility because they dont know about that and if he took that work it is manager responsibility to complete on time. IBM wants visibility on works and team. As manager is the master he is not looking back and just fire some people from his/her team and prove that they are not performing and that is the reason the team is not inventing some new features. Everybody knows the exact reason by it is happening from bottom to top and now it become as IBM Culture.
3) Every half year there is a performance appraisal and put some people to PIP. Here PIP means terminating employees, I never seen any performance improvement plan provided to them instead the company ask them to resign otherwise will terminate you. Due to termination complication most of the employees agrees to resign but getting another job is very difficult as IBM provide high CTC.
4) If you are okay with two year Job in IBM with high salary then it is good. But please dont go to a different skill set in IBM. Because IBM ISL Kochi will fire you within 2 year and that time you will struggle to get another job."

Salary rise was minuscule this year (for me it was like 4% despite being above the expectation, and it was +- like this for everyone in the team). Getting promoted can take anywhere from 3 months to 9 months (actual case of my coworker who got promoted after waiting for 9 months and handing in a notice right before getting it) Return to the office makes no sense (3 days mandatory at least) and if one year ago I could write that IBM has good work-life balance, now I am not so sure about that. It is still better, than in the companies that work fully in the office, but looks like IBM is going there as well. And it's not like the office is any good.

IBM,2,21-Nov-23,Major Benefit Changes and Return to Office,Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","Austin, TX","When you have a great manager that protects you from upper management nonsense, its great","Here's the real reason I'm posting.

1. They've stopped 401k matching (6%) and have switched to a ""Retirement benefit account"" that matches 5% of your salary. The downside is two-fold, returns in the RBA pegged at 3% and you have zero choice in how its invested. If you're early to mid career this is a massive loss. Also because its an RBA and not a 401k you don't have the same protections and choice if something happens to IBM, at least with a 401k its your account, the RBA stays withing IBM's control until you leave

2. The return to office is extremely sloppy, sites not having enough workspace, ""come into the office or resign"" ultimatums...all of this because of poor planning"

Salary rise was minuscule this year (for me it was like 4% despite being above the expectation, and it was +- like this for everyone in the team). Getting promoted can take anywhere from 3 months to 9 months (actual case of my coworker who got promoted after waiting for 9 months and handing in a notice right before getting it) Return to the office makes no sense (3 days mandatory at least) and if one year ago I could write that IBM has good work-life balance, now I am not so sure about that. It is still better, than in the companies that work fully in the office, but looks like IBM is going there as well. And it's not like the office is any good.

1. They've stopped 401k matching (6%) and have switched to a ""Retirement benefit account"" that matches 5% of your salary. The downside is two-fold, returns in the RBA pegged at 3% and you have zero choice in how its invested. If you're early to mid career this is a massive loss. Also because its an RBA and not a 401k you don't have the same protections and choice if something happens to IBM, at least with a 401k its your account, the RBA stays withing IBM's control until you leave

2. The return to office is extremely sloppy, sites not having enough workspace, ""come into the office or resign"" ultimatums...all of this because of poor planning"

IBM,1,31-Jan-24,IBM tells managers to come to the office or leave their jobs - CNN,Senior Developer,"Former Employee, more than 10 years","Poughkeepsie, NY","You get a paycheck, this week.","This CNN headline on 1/31/24 is exactly why I left years ago as these so-called leaders were doing the same thing; cutting staff under the thin veil of what they called ""co-location"". It is nothing more than that. My advice? Leave! Your quality of life and career will improve, drastically. Just ask anyone that took the leap they'll all tell you the very same thing. There are still entire teams that even when on site, work at great distances from each other across vastly different time zones; they are not working together even when in an office - it's a ruse. Those of us that built what used to be idolized as the great IBM of old, is long gone. We built IBM's reputation - not the recent leadership (if you can even confer that on them). Also long gone and buried with Old Man Watson (9-edge, face down as they say) is the company's original mantra - ""Respect for the Individual"" and ""Think"" there is no respect anymore - and these greedy executives don't and can't think; employment is purely transactional and employees became faceless widgets long ago. Current employees are paid just enough but have been loaded with FUD - too scared to leave and ridden by first-line managers that only carry out orders from above after getting their spine-ectomies. Those with skills and value can do far better elsewhere and avoid getting stomach ulcers from living under constant anxiety. The new generation and top talent demand remote work options. My advice to you is this: take a clue - exclude Big Blue from your short list of best places to work, unless you want to work under constant FUD. Don't walk away - run!"

Google,4,21-Jun-13,"Moving at the speed of light, burn out is inevitable",Program Manager,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Mountain View, CA","1) Food, food, food.  15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone.  Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks.  Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus).  Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available.  Bowling alley.  Volley ball pit.  Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV).  Free health/fitness assessments.  Dog-friendly.  Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation.  In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically).  In practice, not true.  

6)  You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry.  There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).","1) Work/life balance.  What balance?  All those perks and benefits are an illusion.  They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive.  I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations.  You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down.  I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us.  Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am.  It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.

2) Poor management.  I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence.  Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult.""  People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into.  So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.  Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.

3) Jerks.  Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same).  Years ago, that wasn't the case.  I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience.  I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.

4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.  So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing.  Google says, ""Don't be evil.""  But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices.  :("
Google,5,10-May-14,"Great balance between big-company security and fun, fast-moving projects",Software Engineer III,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","New York, NY","* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).
* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.
* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.
* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.
* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).
* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.
* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.

Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.
* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.
* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).
* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.
* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture."
Google,5,8-Feb-15,The best place I've worked and also the most demanding.,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,"Mountain View, CA","You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.

You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world

You'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management.

You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing

You'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable. 

There are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free.

Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.

Google cares about how it treats its employees.

The campus is like an academic campus in many ways.

There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.

You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.

If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors. 

The company is flexible - if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don't get me wrong - you'll work a LOT. But you don't have to do all of it chained to your desk.","I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.

Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.

You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning.  No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing - which is kind of hard.

After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear. 

It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.

When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you.  Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.

It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge.   I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out."

One of the most striking aspects of Google's culture is its unwavering commitment to fostering creativity and pushing boundaries. From day one, I was encouraged to think outside the box, experiment with new technologies, and challenge the status quo. The emphasis on innovation is palpable in every project and team meeting, creating an environment where groundbreaking ideas flourish.

Moreover, the level of talent and expertise among my colleagues is unparalleled. Working alongside some of the brightest minds in the industry has not only accelerated my professional development but has also inspired me to strive for excellence in everything I do. The collaborative spirit at Google is truly remarkable, with teams coming together seamlessly to tackle complex problems and deliver world-class solutions.

In addition to the stimulating work environment, Google places a strong emphasis on employee well-being and work-life balance.

Furthermore, the flexibility to work remotely has been invaluable, allowing me to maintain a healthy balance between my professional and personal life.","However, it's worth noting that Google's fast-paced environment may not be suitable for everyone.

The company's commitment to fostering a positive and inclusive work environment has created a culture of collaboration and mutual respect that I truly value. Google's dedication to employee growth, with ongoing training and development opportunities, has not only enhanced my skills but also provided a clear path for career progression.

Google's emphasis on work-life balance, reflected in flexible arrangements and comprehensive wellness programs, has contributed to a positive and thriving work atmosphere. Transparent communication from leadership fosters a sense of trust and unity, making Google not just a workplace but a community. In summary, Google stands out as an outstanding place to work, offering a supportive culture, ample growth opportunities, and a healthy work-life balance. I highly recommend Google to those seeking a fulfilling and rewarding career.","While Google is undoubtedly a remarkable company to work for, like any workplace, it's essential to consider potential challenges. Here are some cons to be aware of:

Intense Work Environment: Google is known for its fast-paced and dynamic work environment. For some individuals, the pressure and pace may be challenging to manage, leading to potential stress or burnout.

Large Organization Challenges: Being a massive multinational corporation, Google's sheer size can sometimes result in bureaucracy and slower decision-making processes. Navigating through the organizational hierarchy may require patience and persistence.

High Expectations: Google sets high expectations for its employees, aiming for innovation and excellence. While this can be motivating, it may also create a demanding atmosphere where meeting and exceeding expectations becomes the norm."

- Compensation (they aim for top 10% so there are definitely other options)","- Run by ex-McKinsey and 2008 financial crisis big-bank veterans
- The worst treatment of employees I have ever seen during their layoffs. Cutting off corp access abruptly, not disclosing to teams and employees who was let go from their teams. In many cases, blatantly lying to employees when justifying these actions 
- Employees on visas were severely mistreated and disadvantaged on their ability to collect severance during ""extended notice layoffs""
- Perks are being constantly removed and teams/projects cut
- Management seemingly has 0 control of their organizations
- Management of entire product areas are upward-failing and seemingly have no passion for their organizations. They lead organizations the size of normal companies and treat it like just a line item on a resume
- Once a leader in diversity/inclusion they have proven that they do not care about these efforts at all since they were the first thing on the chopping block. Even their diverse employees that are on visas were especially mistreated at the first sign of a market down turn
- Severely senior-skewing engineering. You will likely have no opportunities for career advancement"

The company provides its employees with exceptional benefits, including comprehensive healthcare, generous parental leave, and flexible work schedules, promoting a healthy work-life balance. Google's open culture encourages creativity and collaboration, allowing ideas to flourish and employees to grow their careers in diverse directions. Access to cutting-edge technology and resources enables individuals to work on projects that impact millions of users worldwide, making their work incredibly fulfilling and impactful.","Despite the many advantages, working at Google comes with its set of challenges. The highly competitive environment can be stressful, with high expectations and performance metrics to meet, leading to work-life balance issues for some. The company's size can sometimes result in bureaucratic hurdles, making it difficult to push new initiatives forward quickly. Additionally, the intense focus on innovation and constant change may not suit everyone, as it requires adaptability and a continuous learning mindset. For some, the culture of being always ""on"" and the pressure to excel can be overwhelming, overshadowing the benefits."
Google,4,12-Feb-24,A company with a strong engineering culture that is slowly stagnating from management,Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Chicago, IL","Google has a rich history of engineering excellence and brilliance. Even many years removed from the height of the company's innovation, some of this is still evident through a strongly ingrained engineering culture where things are mostly done in an engineering first mindset. Engineering excellence is obvious across the organization and the products/infrastructure built at Google are a testament to this.

Work life balance is, for the most part, extremely good and good work life balance is ingrained in the culture. I have never experienced pressure from managers to work more than 40 hours a week, and the vacation + holidays are decent (though maybe not the absolute best).","There is a clear lack of vision from top management as many of Google's recent ""big"" initiatives seem to be reactive to other tech companies (instead of proactive). When compared to top executives at similar large companies, the current management falls quite short.

A complicated performance/promotion process exists at Google in an effort to measure employees fairly across the large company, however this comes at the cost of wasted cycles and the gamification of the system. This, along with the large variation in teams results in non-uniform opportunities for promotion/career advancement."

Learning and Growth: Google provides ample opportunities for professional development and learning. As an L4, I found myself constantly challenged and learning new things. The company supports attending conferences, taking courses, and even has its own internal platforms for continued learning.

Talented Peers: One of the most enriching aspects of working at Google is the chance to collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the industry. The level of talent and expertise among colleagues is exceptional, fostering a culture of excellence and innovation.

Work-Life Balance: Google is known for its employee-friendly policies. The company offers flexible working hours, and there is a genuine respect for personal time and work-life balance. This aspect is especially appreciated in the tech industry, where burnout can be common.","Large Company Bureaucracy: Being a part of such a large company can sometimes mean navigating through layers of bureaucracy. Decision-making processes can be slow, and there can be a significant amount of red tape in getting things done.

Competitive Environment: While working with talented peers is a pro, it can also lead to a highly competitive environment. There can be pressure to constantly perform at your best, which might be overwhelming for some."

If you do large projects and keep your managers in the loop (like one should as L3 and L4), they say you need hand-holding. If you try to do things independently, they say you are being insubordinate. There's no one way that you can go. Managers outright lie in performance reviews. Add info or projects that were never delegated to you, and even if you escalate it, no one takes note of it, and you become the bad guy. They also like being boot-licked, and such people are showered with spot and peer bonuses for their regular tasks, tasks they were hired for. I will run out of examples, the fact is Google is a sham, and it's worse because they sell ""Googlyness"". It's laughable. No career growth and projects just don't launch. If there's more work and you end up working on a holiday, your manager will put that as your incompetence.

Perks and Benefits: Google offers a wide range of perks such as free meals, fitness centers, laundry services, and more. Additionally, their employee benefits package is often considered one of the best, including health care, retirement plans, and generous parental leave policies.

Learning and Development Opportunities: Employees at Google have access to various learning resources and professional development programs. This environment encourages continuous learning and growth, enabling employees to enhance their skills and advance in their careers.","Work-Life Balance Challenges: Due to the demanding nature of the work and a culture that often celebrates 'going the extra mile', some employees find it challenging to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

Competitive Environment: While being surrounded by highly talented individuals can be inspiring, it can also create a highly competitive atmosphere. This can sometimes lead to stress and pressure to perform at very high levels constantly.

Large Company Bureaucracy: As a large corporation, Google has its share of bureaucracy. This can mean slower decision-making processes, less autonomy in certain roles, and the potential for getting lost in the corporate structure, making it harder for some individuals to make a significant impact."

• The majority of employees are kind and respectful aka. ""googley""
• There are numerous product teams to try new things and grow 
• Lots of internal resources to grow one's career, leadership, and skill set","Google used to have an amazing company culture and flat structural leadership. It's what made Google unique and stand out from the rest. Google has since lost it's overall 'unique company culture' by squeezing out innovation unless its perfecting AI to beat out its competitors. Company moral has tanked, employee input no longer feels authentically heard, valued, and actionable, budget constraints have caused a slim chance in promotion - even when consistently demonstrating next level performance. It's also become difficult to transfer btwn different teams to grow one's Google career. Headcount and resources have been restricted, resulting in stiff competition when applying to new roles.
Google has become another heavy, top-down corporate enterprise using tall organizational structure for more leadership control.
I have truly enjoyed working at Google for many years. These past 2-3 years have really flipped in the opposite way. My hope is that Sundar and leadership revert to putting Googlers and users first, rather than stock and revenue."

Of course, with the size of Google now, at least you can change jobs and find new opportunities for your career without ever leaving the company.","Engineering development is more of a popularity contest. There is very little coherent product management, so the Engineering leads who can make the best product pitch move forward, until they get bored and lose headcount, then Google cancels the product. Software platforms aren't standardized, every team can re-invent the wheel. There is very little interoperability between products, so you can't even leverage what other people have built.
Let's add to that rampant ""brogrammer"" culture, and horrible mistreatment of women. As a woman, you have to have a thick skin to get by, but if you're too brusque and forget to be warm and nurturing you'll be accused of ""being a btich"" or ""not a team player"" or ""difficult to work with."""

You'll notice this immediately, even though management does not.","Workers are no longer valued. Those most knowledgable about Apple products, policies, and the culture of Apple, people who have been with the company 5, 10 even 20 years... are being quiet-cut, or cut altogether.... by the hundreds. You are managed almost entirely through cold automated systems, and management is really only there to help interpret. 

So called ""opportunities"" come in the form of temporary positions only, usually in a role that would be higher paying, but as a temp you will retain your pay rate, despite performing more advanced tasks. When they have gotten their use of you, you are shipped back to over-worked positions not desired by those who have connections you don't have. 

You'll be told that your reviews, your participation in projects and ""voluntary"" tasks will propel you forward, however even years of consistently exceeding expectations, accolades and involvement will never get you past the favoritism, nepotism, and cronyism.

Management has a complete disconnect, with those whom they manage. They essentially act as messengers at some-point in a grape-vine between investors, and staff. They will deliver a message, if you have questions, concerns, or disagreement, you will get the standard corporate speak ""We hear you, we understand and we'll be sure to send your concerns up"", but you will never hear back, concerns will never be addressed, you will just get fed those same corporate speaking lines. 

Workers have little to no input (this was not always the case, even at a company as large as Apple), if you call out any type of issue, you'll be gaslit and told the issue is really you."
Apple,5,14-Feb-24,It is very good,Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Minneapolis, MN","- Working on cutting-edge technology. Apple is known for innovative products and pushing the boundaries of technology. Engineers get to develop new and exciting technologies.

- Strong work culture and benefits. Apple is known for having a great company culture with healthy work-life balance, generous benefits, and perks like free snacks and devices. 

- Career growth opportunities. As a large and successful company, Apple offers plenty of room for advancement as new projects and teams are constantly being created.

- Product-focused work. Engineers work directly on Apple's flagship consumer products like the iPhone, iPad, Mac, etc. rather than more mundane backend systems.","- High expectations and pressure to perform. Apple is known for perfectionism and demanding high quality. This can add stress.

- Secrecy and NDAs. Much of Apple's future product plans are confidential. This limits what engineers can share about their work externally. 

- Bureaucracy of a large company. More red tape and process compared to a startup. Projects take longer to complete.

- Competitive hiring. Very difficult to land a job at Apple due to high number of applicants for each opening.

- Less flexibility andremote work. Apple's culture focuses heavily on collaboration in physical offices, limiting remote work possibilities.

- Potentially lower pay compared to top tech companies given current compensation structure.

Overall, Apple provides a unique experience for engineers to work on cutting-edge consumer technologies, but also comes with expectations of discretion, bureaucracy, and less flexibility than some other companies."

Apple,4,24-Nov-23,Best Retail Pay and Benefits,Specialist,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","San Diego, CA","It’s a fun, fast-paced environment. Specialists don’t work on commissions so we really get to enjoy talking about the products and services - because we believe in them! Wages increase each year. Benefits are generous with many choices and programs.","Scheduling is consistently a problem. It’s truly the only reason I have this job 4 stars. We are regularly given big promises to work with our life requirements, but policies favor young unmarried people with no kids. If you have any personal obligations other than being in college, prepare to fight for any real control over the schedule you are given. FORGET having set hours… I really do love working at Apple! However, I struggle to give my best work when I have to drastically rearrange my family life and spiritual life (which COULD be on a regular schedule) every two weeks. Apple says it has a diverse work force and all of their marketing promotes that, but their retail stores do not have that at all."

6. They’re strict about time off and your availability
7. No room for career growth, do not come to retail thinking you will become a manager long term. You can stay as a specialist for 10 years.
8. Raises have become 1-3% down from 6-10% per year.
9. Hard labour, you’re on your feet all day, they micromanage your breaks+how often you go to the washroom. They get upset if you need a breather when you’re on the sales floor.

5. You can make some friends after ramping together several products.","1.

2. No career development, you can stay as entry level for more than 10 years if not good at showing off or on low visibility projects. 
3. Visibility based performance, instead of actual deliverable. Senior leadership have no willing to understand what team's doing, and have little care of its people, feel just like being a replaceable tool.
4. Internal transfer is harder than external hire, same rounds of interviews + performance req + need notify current manager that you plan to leave before 1st round interview.

- no task will be completed without your manager double checking every single forecast you come up with as they don't trust your abilities and love to micromanage people
- when highlighting how bad direct management is to their superior, they just mask it as the employees fault, which means you are now ""black listed"" as difficult
- when you point out all the things you've done and how well you performed, managers will backtrack and say they never said the things they did and you ""misunderstood""
- they are also very biased towards Irish people and any expat will have to work twice as hard to see any recognition meanwhile you have to complete the unconscious Bias training on a yearly basis
- Apple will hire people above your pay grade with less experience and put them into senior positions, which means you will train them, do their work and yours meanwhile getting paid less and having to work harder to prove your senior status
- when you try to move departments to escape your management, your application might be blocked by said management and you'll be given excuses about you not meeting the requirements even though you are a native speaker and in fact the only person, who speaks the language they are looking for and already working with the team and knowing the job inside out

- Other employee benefits aside from healthcare are nice. 
- The campus is well maintained and nice
- The caffe has great food that is pretty inexpensive for what you get. 
- On campus gym (but it's getting more expensive for some reason)
- Discounts on Apple and third party products/ services
- Occasionally you'll get free swag. 
- Occasionally there are campus parties. Not so much since covid, and never as good as Cupertino.","TL; DR:

- Near zero growth opportunity within AppleCare, and very hard to be seen as a viable candidate to the rest of Apple.
- Career growth pacification programs that provide no real advancement or growth.
- Restrictive rotation and career experience programs. Rather than allowing you to flourish and apply for real world experiences from other departments as much as you'd like, you are restricted to once every six months to a year. 
- Every six months your schedule will likely change, upending your personal life.
- You get hired for a specific role, then get various other roles dumped on you with no pay raise.
- Management will randomly move you around to different managers, desks for no reason. 
- Management either does not care about you, or has no power to make real change when necessary, so they just BS around everything. 

Oh man. I've grown into a bit of a curmudgeon during my time here, so I've definitely got cons. Despite what some will ultimately believe is some sad sack who sabotages themselves into being where they are, that is not the case. I'm not saying that my feelings haven't spilled out over the years, but I mainly keep this stuff inside and uphold composure. All of this stuff is true. 

- Sadly, if you have a hunger and desire to grow your career and advance within Apple and you came to AppleCare (AC) thinking that this would at least be a nice starting place, you have chosen poorly. AC is where talented individuals get trapped within a sea of mediocrity and complacency. So many people are just ""meh"" and have no desire to advance, therefore you cannot advance within the organization, and since it's Apple, it's already extremely competitive, so when opportunities that you would qualify for (which are few and far between unless you're a hardware engineer or programmer with years of experience) open up, it's nearly impossible to stand out to a recruiter for them to even give you the time of day. 

- Because the executive and upper management level of AC know that there are next to zero opportunities due to the competitive nature of Apple, they have created a career growth program designed to make you feel like they care, like there is possible opportunity, and that this program will somehow benefit you, despite it not providing much in the way of anything. They have ""career coaches"" that have barely had a career themselves (seriously, they had the same job that you have right now, then became coaches. Give me someone who has actually advanced), they give you free access to Coursera, which is nice, but it does nothing to make up for the lack of experience or education most roles require, and it offers what are called ""rotations"" which is where you work for another team for up to six months getting real world experience likely doing a job that you'd actually want to do (but without the pay), however the likelihood of getting a job from a rotation is about as likely as you getting struck by lightning on a clear day in the desert as the majority of the orgs that offer rotations are given zero budget for additional headcount. They are perpetually stuck rotating new people in and out every six months. They hate it as much as we do. They wish they could hire some of us as much as we wish we could be hired. 

We're all restricted to one rotation per six months, so in the event to where you'd be amazing for a role that maybe, just maybe might just wind up being able to hire you, too bad so sad. You're stuck in your regular job watching someone else advance who's been there a fraction of the time that you have simply because they were in the right place at the right time. To rub additional salt into the wound, we get emails on the rare occasion that someone is actually hired off of a rotation, as if the career site had anything to do with it. Even better, they've barely even worked at Apple, going from a retail role to just skipping right over you making six figures easy. Now, I assume they're an amazing person who is killing it, but I don't know. What I do know is that I never got the opportunity to present like this person did because of this stupid ""one rotation every six months"" rule. 

- Once every six months your schedule will most likely change, potentially upending your life. It's Apple, right. If they put out a request for people to work odd hours, they would still get a crazy amount of applicants, but for whatever reason, rather than hiring for a specific shift, we all get judged by our metrics. These are metrics that are impossible to perfect due to the nature of our job, so no matter how hard one might try to get perfect metrics so that in turn you get first pick of your schedule, it won't happen. So, you might work from 7am to 4 pm half the year, then 11 am to 8pm the other half. Maybe you need weekends off because you have kids who are enrolled in sports and you want to be there to support them. Too bad so sad if your metrics weren't good enough to get first pick. Whereas once you may have worked Monday thru Friday, now you work Saturday thru Wednesday, or have two random days off rather than consecutively. 

- You get hired for a specific job, then over time you literally take on the job of several other organizations. Let's say you get hired to assist Mac and iPhone customers. Cool - two products (though, these products include all of the built-in apps and services). You can become a master over these two things and get amazing feedback from all of your customers, i.e. excel in your role. Then, the org decides that they want to take on a completely new products because they want to merge your org with what once was a separate org for ""reasons"", and it happens again, and again, and again... and no - you aren't paid more because of it. Now, you're supporting Mac, iOS, lets say Apple Watch, Apple Pay, Apple Fitness +, the Apple TV, Apple TV+, Apple Vision Pro, Apple whatever, therefore you knowledge gets very diluted and you are overall a less helpful person who to a customer doesn't sound like you know what you're doing. 

On top of that, management can't help but want to shake things up for no good reason, so you're often moved around within the office space itself, and you're often moved around to different managers, or to managers that you previously already had, then got moved from, and are now back under. It's like they have nothing better to do, or some budget that they don't want to lose access to and moving us around ""costs money"" or something. You create this fantastic working relationship with those around you, helping each other out, getting to really know people, then BAM! you get moved. Sometimes you get to start over and really get to know a whole new group of people that are awesome, but sometimes you get sat next to some guy that doesn't shower, sleeps all day only to be woken up by a phone call before attempting to nap again, or are sat next to someone who has anger management issues and slams their hands against the desk because every single customer frustrates them, etc. No wonder they treat AppleCare like children - it can be a daycare sometimes. I don't know why they allow this kind of thing to continue. 

- Management doesn't care about you. Any time you bring up a legitimate issue, you have to set up a meeting for when they're available, which can be weeks later sometimes, only to be given some really politically correct, BS response where nothing happens. It's like everyone is just biding their time, waiting to retire or die, and no one wants to ""rock the boat"". They want to talk the talk, but not walk the walk."

Customers are going to make you upset, the store will always be busy, and you will be asked to put on a smile at all times. Also, there are many employees and finding a full-time role is rare. In my case, the store leader and senior manager were mediocre and they only cared about themselves and their little clique. It was condescending and also ironic that a ""store leader"" and ""senior manager"" who did not know how any of the products work can tell you that you need to improve performance when they cannot offer help themselves. They would just hide in their office and ignore the madness of the store, especially during peak hours on the weekend (part of the reason why we were always behind on appointments). Additionally, we would be required to put in PTO a month and half or two months before the actual date while they were always out on vacation. It was demeaning and obvious that they did not care about the overall happiness of their employees. 

Also, the worst feeling about working at this store location is that senior management did not promote from within, when the store had so many talented people who could lead this location to success. There were so many employees who spent years working here that were overlooked for leadership roles when they 100% deserved it. Instead, it would be common for leadership to hire externally and bring on people who had no tech savviness whatsoever. Again, it would feel demeaning to have an outside hire manager/lead try to rate your performance when they didn't even know how to use an iPhone."

Apple,3,13-Jan-24,Its ok for like a year or two but don't expect many career opportunities,Specialist,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Melbourne,"The team are excellent, you make lifelong friends with most people, includes free private healthcare, university reimbursement (up to 5k per year) and 700 reimbursement for gym membership (but don't expect any free products).

The culture does teach you a lot about resilience, your journey can teach you even more about navigating complex issues (but expect to learn most of that on your own).

Word of advice, don't tell anyone anything (they will use it against you) and stay far AWAY from Experts and Pros they are not your friends, they're self serving paid snitches who tell managers everything.","The worst aspect is a customer review works as 5 starts is 100% BUT 4 stars is 50%... HOW IS THAT FAIR!? One review can absolutely NOSE DIVE your team member score... PLUS there is no tangible incentive (especially when you consider each PT team member can sell around $1.5-2 million in products annually) then they say you're not meeting expectations which is BS. When you consider the amount of sales team members do in a year, no bonuses are absolutely ridiculous... Not even a Christmas party! They'll provide chips and chocolate in the break room (cough cough where's the fruit)

The expectations of customers are absolutely RIDICULOUS! Customers expect you to know everything on a measly wage, can often be very demanding and just insist 'you do everything' and don't actually listen. Management doesn't empower team to say 'no'... Expect to be dealing with a lot of customers of ALL ages (Gen Z to Boomers) who are completely incompetent and not interested in learning the basics instead they come into the Apple Store with all their issues they could easily solve with the most basic problem solving skills.

Culture can feel overwhelming and fake, recently the culture has shifted to more results focused with no financial or tangible rewards, they manipulate you to pursue growth but it's literally IMPOSSIBLE to grow to their expectations unless you sell your soul to them.

Most managers are absolutely useless at providing any assistance when you're facing challenges with customers, will often bend to customers or reverse the question so YOU have to deal with them. But have to shout out to the few who work very hard and are incredible.

The stock program rewards staff with a 1.5k bonus with stocks each year but they vest over 3 years... So it's just another way to manipulate people to stay."

Once you off-board from a client project, you better pray to God that you find another one (and yes, I mean YOU because you are pretty much on your own finding one) because they only give you 35 days not being on a project and they give you the boot. This isn't considered a 'Layoff' where the news is concerned so it's a backdoor way for them to not have to tell the world/investors that they layed off a WAY bigger percentage of their workforce than they want to admit. I, thankfully have been on a client project consistently but how they have gotten rid of incredibly talented and valuable people based on this policy is a complete joke. I have zero respect for the leadership and I can't wait for the day that I find a better opportunity elsewhere. Another thing, they rate employees on a 1-5 scale at the end of the year and that is supposed to reflect in your raise, well, last year even people rated at a 4 & 5 (the highest) got the same size raise as lower-rated employees. So all of us who broke our backs for this company were basically told that we were worth the same amount as someone who did the bare minimum or even less. Total insult!"

They acquired Nuance 7 months ago and now another company is acquiring them. People who do not work basically get to do whatever they want. While the hard workers have to pick up all the slack. No raises at all. Refuse to pay any OT ever even when your clinic is busy.

Also, the teams I have been on have been pretty strong with smart people.","How much time to do you have? Years before the company I worked for was acquired by Cognizant, I worked on a team with other consultants, mostly from Cognizant. None had anything good to say about the firm and several, independent of one another, urged me never to sign on with Cognizant because they treat their people terribly. Well several years later the company I worked for was acquired and I had no choice. I tried to hang in there but it's clear employees do not matter. Now I understand why I was warned. 
A number of times last year, the former CEO sent emails first urging return to office, then stating he was disappointed to see so many offices. I was hired as a fully remote employee and was not the only one, yet there was no negotiation about this supposed The two clients I worked with last year were in a different time zone and I was the only team member in my city. Further, local offices sent out communications indicating that they had very limited desk space that needed to be reserved in advance. Why would I travel an hour from home to be the only one on my team at a local office, which may or may not be able to provide a workspace? For optics? No thanks. I never went in.

Recently Cognizant eliminated unlimited PTO and gave everyone across the board, regardless of tenure, less than industry standard PTO.

Another requirement that makes no sense is that employees are required to complete a week's worth of training - on their own time each year - in order to qualify for paltry increases. However, training is internal and absolutely a waste of time. No professional learns anything from their incredibly weak training modules, which by the way rarely run without timing out, even with the best wifi connection. One of the perks Cognizant likes to promote is that they will pay for up to two certifications per year, but even when approval is granted, getting it approved is a series of hoops that doesn't seem worth the frustration. When that is complete, getting a reimbursement is again, long, difficult, and exhausting. The team overseeing the reimbursements outright rejects complete and accurate requests over and over without review. When you escalate it, they approve only to reject it last minute before payroll is finalized, several times. If you survive all of this and have 3-4 months to dedicate, they eventually pay you back, but it hardly seems worth it at that point. (This is sadly not an exaggeration and happened to me personally 3 separate times. I have since just paid out of pocket for any certifications I am interested in. 

 There is little to no support from HR or management. Home managers change every few months with no warning. Even figuring out to who to talk to in various business units when you need internal support is virtually impossible. When an assignment ends, it is your responsibility to find your own next assignment or be laid off. I took a job as a consultant because my prior firm would task a manager to find roles in the pipeline that would be a good fit for your skillset or one that would grow your skillset if that's something you were interested in. Those days are long gone since we fully transitioned to the cognizant way of doing things. You are required to use an archaic tool that is supposed to do a skills match but gets it wrong about 95% of the time and managers rarely respond to job applications or close them because roles are indefinitely on hold or were earmarked for a consultant already on the project. You are either matched with jobs you have no skillset for - and pressured to apply - or get matched with jobs that are earmarked for outside recruiting. Meanwhile management strongly encourages benched staff to apply for and take jobs they are not qualified. For example, if youre a senior associate you are pressured to go for manager jobs, but most manager jobs are not marked for promotion, so even if you can manage the workload and skillset, you do not get a promotion nor the appropriate pay adjustment for the role. Billing the highest possible rate is is all they care about and when roles do match, they prioritize offshore resources (who they pay far less for the same work) and college recruits (who again, they pay far less for the same work). It is very clear the organization and individual business units are not invested in keeping talent. 

It is a lonely and depressing organization to work for. Do not do it. Run."

Also, the teams I have been on have been pretty strong with smart people.","How much time to do you have? Years before the company I worked for was acquired by Cognizant, I worked on a team with other consultants, mostly from Cognizant. None had anything good to say about the firm and several, independent of one another, urged me never to sign on with Cognizant because they treat their people terribly. Well several years later the company I worked for was acquired and I had no choice. I tried to hang in there but it's clear employees do not matter. Now I understand why I was warned. 
A number of times last year, the former CEO sent emails first urging return to office, then stating he was disappointed to see so many offices. I was hired as a fully remote employee and was not the only one, yet there was no negotiation about this supposed The two clients I worked with last year were in a different time zone and I was the only team member in my city. Further, local offices sent out communications indicating that they had very limited desk space that needed to be reserved in advance. Why would I travel an hour from home to be the only one on my team at a local office, which may or may not be able to provide a workspace? For optics? No thanks. I never went in.

All about similar age groups, so its pretty fun

Btw, saw many cons about the company or the team here...Honestly I think it varies from person to person and whether you vibe with your manager (works the same everywhere tbh)...and tendency for someone to get chased by managers or people is probably because you're always MIA, not replying on time or just not interested to be productive when you should. So if you're prompt and responsible, your life pretty chill tbh...just got to get your stuff tgth.

In simple words, at least for the cons I see here, chances are these people didn't perform very well and so they faced more wrath from their managers so their experience tends to be bad...but well, just my honest opinion. Chill yall, its actually pretty alright here :)","- True that KPIs and directions change a lot, but seriously what do you expect from an ecommerce industry? it is what it is, dont expect it to be like I dk, Government sector or NTUC where it's old school and stable. Because it's so competitive in this industry, you always got to adapt and go with a different plan."

Also the management push back hard on flexible WFH policies even though a lot of the employees requested."
Shopee,1,20-Jan-24,Terrible,Business Development,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Kuala Lumpur,"real life drama, can save money for Netflix subscription","-First time in my life, I ever heard of a company that doesn't assess employees based on KPIs.
-Pathetic benefits, only RM150 for optical. What stoneage year does a pair of spectacles cost RM150? Also company secretly change policy without informing everyone, hoping everyone will quietly accept it. It then caused a huge commotion btw.
-Lousy communication channels, mostly use messenger to communicate. Imagine staffs using the same group chat to gossip and comms work related stuff, you have to scroll 200+ msges to not miss out on work stuffs.
-forces you to WFO cause according to management this is more ""productive"". Then you get employees staring at the screen with nothing to do, play phone, sleep during working hours. 
-HR is useless as they are just there to ensure you don't sue the company. Everything is ""top management's decision"". Always be aware as they could retract your offer even after you signed.
-Gave employees food poisoning during annual celebration and their feedback for employees is to ""take care"". Still have to go back to office btw
-No career advancement. Managers prefer button pushers and block out all suggestions. Brown nose working culture as they spend more time to please bosses instead of making real changes."
Shopee,2,10-Aug-21,Only if I knew this beforehand,Analyst,Current Employee,Singapore,"1. People are generally nice, minimal/no office politics

2. Everyone is willing to share and offer help when necessary","1. Brief hierarchy of the company: Team Assistant (TA); Associate; Senior Associate; So on and so forth. If you just graduate from NUS/NTU/SMU, the entry level position offered to you will be Associate. If you're from any other local/private unis in SG, the entry level position the company deem suited for you is TA. So you may graduate the same year as your friend but they may be your superior because of your school:) These are applicable for fresh grads and majority of the teams only. 

TLDR, as a TA, you're basically everybody's assistant. You take instructions from anyone above your ""rank""

2. Your day end at 7PM, so naturally you will miss your usual dinner time with your family and friends taking into consideration the travel time. (Timing can never match with your friends unless they starve and wait for you)

3. OT is norm and not paid (you feel elated when you're able to get out of office on time and still see bright sky lol. dont try to plan anything outside of work cause tasks are unpredictable and you may be given a task at 630PM and they expect you to complete asap)

4. Managers check in with you time to time and after sharing your concerns, work are still given to you (mgrs check for the sake of checking, they also need to report mah)

5. People are still working on leave/after office hours. Receiving messages and emails at 12AM? norm

6. If you speak chinese
a) awesome cause you can 'blend"" in easier and mgrs are generally glad to hear that you speak their mother tongue language
b)boo cause you need to help your non-chinese speaking teammates (not their fault btw) with their work AKA translation. ppl from other teams will prefer to seek help from you than your teammate since they can communicate better with you in their language

7. No clear career progression, job scope not defined (always doing work with no background given)

8. Turnover rate high. around half of my teammates has left after staying for less than 6 months or before their 3 months probation. The burnout is real:)

9. Work is extremely manual. Time spent on Crtl C + Crtl V takes up your whole day, thats why the company needs TA

10. The only time you get to interact with your teammates is lunch time/ team bonding session (usually held after work but will still attend cause FOMO)"

No doubt you'll talk tech (mostly the MSFT stack) from enterprise to consumer - from PCs to phones to Xboxes - from datacenter to desktop.

2.  What were GREAT benefits are now VERY GOOD (took a small step down) but still probably better than you'll find at 99% of large corporations.  If you've got family - the value of the benefits is even higher.  401k match is nice.

3.  Even with it's struggles MSFT is still a cash printing machine.  This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work, you can have a stable job, pay your bills, feed your family, and not worry (too much) about layoffs.  The stock you own likely won't tank, but probably won't go up much either.  You'll get a bonus each year and some stock.  It's a decent life if you aren't looking to light the world on fire.","Brand on Your Resume:  After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there's 90,000 employees, don't think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies.

Managing Your Career:  Make you say this out loud so it registers - 90,000 employees work there.  Double that for vendors.  It is VERY hard to ""stand out"" and move up in the company.  Don't expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals - they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too.  Not familiar with the stack rank?  Check out the 2012 Vanity Fair article called ""Microsoft's Lost Decade""."
Microsoft,4,10-Feb-24,Can be a great place to work if you find a good team,Senior Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Redmond, WA","* Ability to switch jobs internally within Microsoft to work on all different kinds of projects in all areas of software. Different teams have different cultures and practices, so look for a team that's a good match for you.
* In general, the culture is improving on customer focus and growth mindset. Although management can be political and chaotic, the folks at the ground level generally are supportive of each other and stiving to make the best, most positive products that they can.
* Lots of resources to do things on a large scale and have a big impact.
* Microsoft takes ethics seriously and has a real commitment to doing the right thing.","* Difficult environment for innovation. Microsoft tends to be better at improving existing products than creating new ones. Microsoft puts a lot of effort into innovating, but it often reorganizes, changes directions, or cancels projects before things can pan out.
* Lots of meetings and process that comes with being a large company that has to coordinate between teams.
* Although this isn't generally the case, some ""old Microsoft"" teams can be very stressful and power struggles between teams and leaders are common."
Microsoft,4,7-Jan-24,Good company to work for,Senior Product Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"As far as big corporations go, Microsoft is one of the best ones to work. The company culture is overall great. They emphasize a growth mindset and try to care about people. They have strong emphasis on diversity and inclusion which helps everyone think about how to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment. The pay and benefits are competitive. Because of all the products they work on, you can work on different products and move teams without leaving the company. They’re also making a lot of great strategic decisions which gives me faith in the leadership and direction they’re headed.","While the company culture overall is good and they try to emphasize good values, it’s a huge company so you can have a vast difference in experience depending on where you work. If you’re interviewing, make sure you meet with your hiring manager, evaluate them and ask questions about the culture of the team. 
A lot of work is still Seattle centric which makes it difficult to be visible if you’re new and remote, impacting promotions, influence, etc.
If you’re getting hired for a PM position, make sure you understand what is expected from the role. It looks vastly different depending on the product and its needs. I would recommend staying away from products that aren’t growing, especially as a PM."
Microsoft,3,23-Jan-24,More of a Program Management shop,Sr. Product Manager,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Chicago, IL","Company employees are very nice, helpful, down to earth and very family oriented. Opportunities within the company are plenty; I also think though no experienced yet that the troubles you have to get into a type of Product role you don't have experience in, is not faced once you are within. However, you do you have to go through all rounds of interviews like external candidates except 1 or 2 rounds if you are within the same overall organization from the top.","Company still isn't doing true Product Management and is much more Program Management oriented. Don't get me wrong; I am sure there are few products that do run a Product shop but I had been hard pressed to find them. Also, organization is very siloed and broken up so there are so many dependencies across departments which slows down how fast you can generate impact."
Microsoft,4,22-Jan-24,Handled layoffs respectfully,Senior Software Engineer,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",,"I only worked at Microsoft for about 8 months after my company was acquired by them, but had a positive experience overall. A lot of nice benefits, good pay, and opportunities if you're able to find the right role for yourself.

My position was eventually eliminated and I was laid off, but was given 3 months of severance pay and felt that Microsoft handled the process with dignity. Obviously nobody wants to get that call, but it ended up being a good catalyst for my career and having the 3 months of full salary/benefits to take a break and job search was really nice.","As with other large corporations there's a lot of bureaucracy and rigid process. Hard for me to comment much further due to my short stint and unique situation with the corporate transition as noted above. They also were going to have us give up our MacBooks, which is hardly a surprise given that it's Microsoft, but that was very unpopular with most of the engineers coming into the organization."
Microsoft,3,15-Feb-24,Teams consist of people who've worked in the same team for at least 5 years,Software Engineer II,Former Employee,"Redmond, WA",They know in's an out's of the product.,"Good luck getting them to share openly. 
This doesn't speak for MSFT as a whole, but people who stay at a place longer tend to have set preferences, don't want things to change too much, can be hostile towards people who are new and different in their approach.
Good luck communicating with such folks.
MSFT has been a stable company where people tend to stay long. 
Its good for their stability, but there is a reason you need diversity."
Microsoft,4,13-Feb-24,Good place to work as a lifestyle job,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Atlanta, GA",They prioritize work life balance and give great benefits/vacation. The work has a global impact and the scale of the company is massive. They tend to have the smartest people working there.,"Very little authority to execute projects because of the influence-based culture. Consensus has to be reached before anything can get done, and then every step of the way there are people who dissent, question, push back, etc. It is also extremely challenging to switch roles right now, especially if working for a manager with whom you don't work well."
Microsoft,4,15-Feb-24,Working environment changes with whoever is running the show,Support Escalation Manager,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Irving, TX",Great pay and benefits. Opportunities to grow career at various global locations.,Inconsistent management styles in some departments lead to a toxic work environment.
Microsoft,5,7-Nov-23,Microsoft Recruiter,Technical Recruiter,"Former Employee, more than 10 years","Seattle, WA","Windows Operating System: Microsoft's Windows OS is widely used globally due to its user-friendly interface and compatibility with a vast array of software and hardware.

Good pay Good benefits If you are a good self-guided learner then you have lots of opportunities to learn and grow.,Executive leadership seems to have become disconnected from employee's needs and reality. Can easily get lost in the noise of the company. You need to always be selling yourself to show impact and value. RIFs happen and can be large numbers and your impact to the business can be ignored.
Microsoft,3,16-Feb-24,Lack of company culture ,Senior UX Researcher,Former Employee,"Seattle, WA",Still offers a lot of remote work options,Didn’t feel like it was easy to connect with the organization. First time it felt like wasn’t having fun at work

Customers tend to buy Microsoft products because this company also offers Office which is usually used in each organization.","The company is huge, so it's difficult to experience different work in a role."
Microsoft,2,9-Jan-24,"Great benefits and compensation *ZERO* Work, Life Balance",Marketing Director,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"Good team, most want to help when they can. Great benefits and compensation which is required when mental health suffers due to 7 day work week, laughable ""time off,"" and you need to leave for your own sanity.","If you're allergic to 70+ hour work weeks, don't come to Microsoft. GM's and CVP's will work you into the ground until you turn to dust and then just hire your replacement."
Microsoft,5,16-Feb-24,Highly recommend,Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Seattle, WA",A lot is traction is happening at MSFT due to AI.,"The tech layoff's, not easy to be distracted by what is happening."
Microsoft,4,10-Nov-23,Heavy Sales,Customer Success Manager (CSM),"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Minneapolis, MN","Microsoft has amazing products and services for enterprise customers, so many companies use them...creating a lot of opportunity. The culture as a strong learning mindset and encourages people to grow and try new roles, so it's always interesting and new.","Even if you're not in a sales role, you're expected to sell the latest stuff...even if your customers aren't there yet. Also, while the culture is very employee-oriented, encouraging, diverse, and focused on work life balance and wellness, it can be very stressful due to the demand to produce new sales. And they have their own internal language (and acronyms that have 12 different meanings) that takes a while to adapt to, on top of the fact that their products and features change so rapidly (including their product names) it's almost impossible to keep up. So be aware...onboarding is like waterskiing without skis; you get dragged while hanging on for dear life."
Microsoft,5,17-Sep-23,Microsoft is what others wish to be.,Director,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","Charlotte, NC","Microsoft is a Technology company built by engineers from the ground up and designed to be run by engineers. (Gates) The company had a dark period under Ballmer, but that’s because he was not an engineer and did not fully understand how engineers think and what they respond to and it was reflected in the flat stock for more than 10 years. We now have an Engineer at the helm again in Satya Nadella and the company is back on track to continue to do great things. Pros: -Great culture -You get to work with really smart people -Decent Salary -Good work life balance -Good top level managers placing the right bets at the right times.","-The Baller years were not great -Technical training is an issue -MSFT will let you work as hard as you want so your work life balance can get out of whack. -Some people do not like the employee ranking system but that is often because its not understood, its not terrible, but the company can do a better job of explaining exactly how it works. - The RIF's are always rough but sometimes necessary"
Microsoft,5,26-Jan-24,Everything everywhere all at once!,Technical Writer,Current Employee,"Indianapolis, IN","Great senior leadership, benefits, and work flexibility.","This is not exactly a ""con,"" but is something to consider: It's a huge company that comes with a lot of complexity and various ""work cultures."" You need to be able to navigate through ambiguity at times and advocate for yourself. Working for Microsoft is not for the faint of heart."
Microsoft,2,23-Jan-24,"It's improved, but still has a long way to go",Senior Software Developer,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","Redmond, WA","The culture at Microsoft has improved since the beginning of the millenium. A lot. The elimination of stack ranking was a good move.

Healthcare coverage is excellent, as are other benefits (Perks+, flexible working location, etc.)","There is still a lot of micromanaging that hurts employee morale and creativity. Many in mid-to-upper management are still learning to shift away from the old culture.

Microsoft's pattern of regular layoffs and then hiring new people is, for lack of a better way of saying it, cruel."
Microsoft,3,3-Jan-24,"A ""safe"" job",Software Engineer II,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Seattle, WA","-Pay and benefits are ok
-Company isn't going to go belly-up anytime soon
-There are some real ""world class"" technical problems to solve","-Pay and benefits are only ok for the size of the company

Also Premera insurance does not cover weight loss Rx (GLP-1) without extensive “try other methods” for 3 months PA requirement, which many of Microsoft’s competitors policies do cover. If you read up on GLP and employer plans covering them, Microsoft’s weight loss coverage is pretty archaic (will cover bariatric surgery at $30k but not GLP-1 which studies have shown, the current generations are just as effective as bariatric without all the risks associated with surgery)"

Microsoft,2,11-Aug-23,Morale circling the drain,PM Lead,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","Redmond, WA","There are still many good things about Microsoft. The compensation is fairly high (though not the highest), and the benefits are good overall. Many of my colleagues are smart, positive, helpful people.","The phrase ""do more with less"" is once again becoming toxic at Microsoft. First, it was do more with less, because Microsoft has been laying off people right and left — many of them totally unnecessarily. The work still needs to be done, but they just cut the teams doing it. My team was cut by 60% even though there is more work than before. Then, it was do more with less compensation, when Microsoft decided not to give raises to full-time employees (during high inflation, let's call this what it is: a pay cut). The, it was do more with less as Microsoft is reducing its budget for morale, equipment, travel, vendors, everything really. WLB has gotten worse. Compensation has gotten worse. Culture has gotten worse. Morale is the lowest I've seen in over a decade. And leadership appears not to care; worse, even to be daring people to complain, daring them to leave. It's not good lately."

Tata Consultancy Services,3,6-Jan-24,Worst Management I've ever encountered ,Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Newark, NJ",It's fairly easy to pass the interviews,"They force you to look for ""Projects"" that you are hired for. Like WHAT? That should never be an employee's concern, like YOU hired ME for work, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WORK YOUR COMPANY NEEDS! If you don't find a ""project"" within one month, they'll threaten to fire you! So you are frantically having to talk to your ""regional manager"" to help you find a project or talk internally to different team managers.
Even if you are hired as a ""Java Dev"", they'll completely disregard it and try to put you on a different project with unrelated experience.
Nobody knows what's going on in management and someone tried to make me go back into the office while I was covid-compromised until it was escalated with other managers. 
They play favors to folks and overwork newer employees to the brim."

1. Pay/Benefits are not competitive with Big 4 and some boutique consulting firms.
2. Dishonest senior leadership - recent layoff was done without notice, reasonable severance, or other common courtesies.
3. Lack of Diversity - all of the executive leadership team are Indian men...it trickles down to lower levels where other demographic groups are excluded from opportunities.
4. Lack of Advancement - there's been a hiring ""freeze"" for over 4 years now.
5. Lack of Identity (Low Cost Outsourcer vs SI/Consulting Firm) - TCS is stuck in bottom line mentality... leaning on low overseas labor as their competitive advantage. This leads to a lack of vision, investment in employees, and effort to differentiate or deliver quality products.
6. Many others... too many to list."

Meta,5,17-Mar-14,"Open, fast, no bs",Software Development Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Seattle, WA","It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is, but it's true; it's more open than any other place I've worked at. At a company wide-level, secret projects, public incidents, important non-public business metrics and the like are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them directly to Zuckerburg at the weekly Q&A. I think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect. This is much different from previous companies I worked at, where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that there's certain things that can't be discussed, and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a ""need to know"" basis, etc. 

This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc. The flipside of this openness is that you of course, have to be willing to receive the feedback, you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged, decisions have to get made, and actions and data are more valuable than words. At the higher level, since the company trusts employees with access to so much information, keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously.

It's a great place to work as an engineer. You're given a lot of freedom, but it's also a responsibility to make sure you're doing things that are valuable. You don't get much credit for working hard or being smart if you don't produce valuable output.

One cool thing about Facebook, in contrast to other comparable companies (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, though in truth, FB is much smaller), is how they have a pretty singular focus. Even with the differing areas (including advertising and such), they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible. I also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for. It seems like popular opinion has it that FB is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $-signs. From within the company, it didn't feel this way at all. I saw a lot of empathy towards users, and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit. The strategy is not complex. The thinking is that if they can make FB easier and more fun to use, then more people will use it for more time each day (which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it), then the advertising dollars will follow. Of course, it is true that FB wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well, but there are a lot of people at FB who care about privacy and security.

They have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code. They have a lot of cool internal tools, and what they've built is really impressive, and more importantly, it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved. Every software company tries to do this, but FB seems to have been more successful with it. Perhaps it's because they're still relatively small, but if anything, I can at least say it is very cool while it lasts.

The perks and work environment are great, unless you're one of those types that can't stand open office spaces. I've worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies. While I do think a private office has some benefits, I mostly think it's a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company. I'd much rather have the money go into other areas like salary, benefits, and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices.

Of course, you've heard about the food and snacks. They have an amazing selection of great stuff, and what I like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations. Sure, some days, lunch is better than others, but I really can't complain, and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing. It's not like you should work at FB just because of that, but it demonstrates FB's desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible.

You'll be surrounded by people who like being there. I can't think of a better environment to work in. If you have a giant ego, you may not like it as much. Respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry, and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees. However, if for whatever reason, you can't perform at the level expected, no one is going to care if you did this and that at Google or shipped ten things at MS, etc.

FB also has a lot of fun events, and I made a lot of friends working there, so going to the events was fun. Also, if you're older and worried that FB is just a bunch of 22-year-olds, and that you won't fit in, I wouldn't worry about that. FB does have a lot of young employees (who are really smart btw), and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college, but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like Google, MS, Amazon, etc.

Work-life-balance seemed totally normal to me. It may be different depending on your team, but I felt you could do 40-50 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine. It's about what you produce, not how hard you're working. Other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times. I didn't see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that. Of course, there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens, but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly, from what I observed. Now, there were many times where I chose to work late myself, but I never felt any pressure to do so. The caveat is that there are on-call rotations, and in addition, even if you are not on-call, you are expected to be reasonably available if the on-call person needs your help. However, again, no one wants this, and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations.

The best thing I can say is that working at FB is about productivity. I didn't experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it.","FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.

FB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be applicable elsewhere.

FB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and ""get with the program"" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point. The nice thing is that things are at least very consistent."

Meta,5,16-Feb-16,Pleasantly Surprised,Site Selection Program Manager,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","I'm a 55 year old working in a company where the average age is 28, and I've never been happier. I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the ""Pros"" as I see them...

- Leadership:  Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real.
- The Culture:  The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else.
- The People:  Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere.
- Management:  Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.
- Benefits:  Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.

Granted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.","Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off. Of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance, but it's not such that 10-12 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless. We do what we do to get the job done; no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.

Being able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue."

• Work is challenging but not overwhelming, and will absolutely teach you how to excel at any Big Tech or similarly mature company
• There is a proliferation of knowledge resources, workshops, and other (actually fun) social activities","• Similar to every huge company, it's very easy to do duplicative projects, spend months on incremental changes to a single feature or project, or find that progress on your work is heavily dependent on other teams' work
• What seems to be a simple change or improvement almost always snowballs into months of tweaks and approvals; you need an preternatural sense of organization to work here sometimes
• It's very hard to work on anything truly innovative or net-new unless you're prepared to go director-level with a rock-solid case

Everything was pretty good until 2023","The leadership within the recruiting team, particularly at the director level and above, appears to lack effective decision-making and accountability. The recent wave of layoffs affecting 21,000 employees is attributed to their actions, yet there has been a concerning lack of accountability. Furthermore, the promotion of the individual leader largely responsible for the layoffs raises questions about the company's commitment to both integrity and sound decision-making.

In response to the realization that the layoffs were excessive, Meta is now rehiring recruiters, albeit on contracts without RSUs or bonuses. The recruitment strategy appears inconsistent and uninformed, as many individuals with little previous experience at Meta, including notoriously low performers, are being rehired. Furthermore, they have decided to hire many new recruiters from external sources over rehiring numerous previous Meta employees with several years of tenure and consistent high-performance ratings, which is an absolutely disgraceful practice. While some rehired recruiters are extremely deserving, the overall process has negatively impacted many talented and loyal professionals, leaving an incredible sense of resentment for a company that I once held in high regard."
Meta,1,12-Feb-24,Toxic culture obliterates any upside,Researcher,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",,"- Opportunity to work on innovative future-facing tech 

- Fair pay and amazing benefits

- A lot of great, bright people - only a few will be pleasant to work with as well because of the corporate culture (see cons) 

- Learning opportunities with education and conference benefits (though these seem to have been cut in lieu of ""efficiency"")

- Surpassed expectations for work-life balance. Though, admittedly, this wholly self-controlled. But, if you want it, you can have it.","- Lack of trust - among the people you work with and upwards towards leadership 

- Lack of vision - typically product evolution includes both a business and a user perspective. Here you might get ""[Name] says we need to ______"" or ""We already promised [Name] to do ________"" without a lot of rationale or data to support anything. There was *one* business leader that explicitly called out this use of their name and said it wasn't an acceptable excuse to developing product in undesirable ways. Most leaders will relish in their ""influence"" at the expense of efficient, human-centered product development

- Managers, if you have one, are generally useless but protected by the managers above them. All are incentivized by growing their teams, regardless of if it makes sense for the business. 

- News and company perceptions can weigh heavily on you 

- Prides itself on operating as a startup still, but it's nearly impossible at meta's scale to operate like this. Siloing and duplicative efforts of people desperate to prove their impact are the norm. 

- Likability is a currency for success. Paradoxically, the performance system encourages a 'dog eat dog' environment of overachieving ICs riddled with fear and insecurity as they try to prove why they're better than everybody around them thereby killing any chance of community. Note, it's not really the ICs fault this fear-culture flourishes. No matter what the company states, there is a performance curve - and no matter how amazing the talent, a certain percent of people will have to fall below the line as not meeting expectations and getting performance plans to shove them out the door and meet quotas 

- Researchers can expect an expectation matrix of about 1200 bullet points and 5 different job descriptions in one. Many managers are not shy about saying they use these bullet points like a checklist to figure out where you're lacking. (A tangential aside - while your performance success is highly contingent upon your ability to influence, no other functions will have performance matrixes that require them to work effectively with research) 

- Lack of follow through and commitment to employee experience and well-being. You will be asked to provide feedback on the company, re-assured of why you are so important to the company, etc. but 1) feedback is rarely acted on (though you will have to participate in biannual ideations for leadership so they can solve their own problems - and after you've wasted time on that, nothing will change and you'll do it again in 6 months) and 2) when the tides turn, you'll realize your input, feedback and value are essentially null and they won't hesitate to cut the cog out of the machine. It's business. And they'll likely provide enough threat (additional employee cuts or harsh policies) or incentive (extra bonuses) to make everybody else forget about that time they threw their employees under the bus."

This aspect of the job is genuinely exciting and provides a great learning opportunity for anyone passionate about the future of tech. Comp, benefits and perks are great.","Unfortunately, the experience is significantly marred by poor leadership and senior management. There is a noticeable lack of solid direction or a coherent point of view, which makes strategic planning and execution very challenging. No one wants to make a decision here. Major group think issues largely due to poor leadership POV. 

The approach to decision-making is not data-driven, often seeming haphazard or impulsive. This ""shooting from the hip"" style contributes to a sense of uncertainty and inefficiency within the team.
A significant concern is the inability of leadership to make decisive and timely decisions. This indecisiveness not only hampers progress but also contributes to a frustrating work environment.

There is a widespread (justifiable) lack of respect for the marketing leadership of Reality Labs across various departments, from marketing, strategy, and creative. I think about 80% of the colleagues have openly voiced their concerns. It's actually alarming. This lack of respect is alarming and raises questions about the sustainability of current leadership. I never worked somewhere where it's more obvious and openly out there that the leadership is NAF. 

The choice to collaborate with BBDO as an agency partner has been a controversial move, casting doubts on the upper management's decision-making capabilities—and is emblematic of the leadership's misjudgments and disconnect from industry standards.

The overarching issue seems to be a disconnect between the Reality Labs org and the practical realities of the market and our audience. It's concerning how out of touch the leadership appears, prompting serious questions about the Meta's Marketing direction and vision for Reality Labs."

My only ratings at Meta were 'meets all' or above and I was pushed out by my out-of-touch manager because he needed a few people off of his team to meet quota. The culture has devolved into people being so afraid of getting laid off that they work around the clock (ex. 1: My PM team all talked about how they worked until midnight every day ex 2: One of my coworkers cut her maternity leave for her first kid short by two months so that she could be around for end of year reviews and next year planning) and backstabbing - no critical feedback is ever delivered to you, it is only ever 'back channeled' to your management chain so that it can be used against you in reviews.

Meta,5,1-May-15,Landslide win over Google for career growth,Software Engineer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Menlo Park, CA","I just left Google and joined Facebook, and felt so much happier. The reasons are:

1. The real impact
At Google I joined a team whose product is only used by less than 1000 people, and even for that product I was assigned to do a peripheral part, whose functionality actually doesn't matter at all. Just for that module, I had to write unit test for every silly part of the code, and took long iteration cycles. I admit those are good engineering coding trainings, however taking precious time in my life to work on something that doesn't matter is just a waste of my life.

In Facebook things just move so much faster. There are standard software engineering review process but not as rigid. Just during training (boot camp) weeks, I had tasks to change very important part of Facebook's core code, and the second day after I check-in my code, it got shipped to almost 1 billion people. As a software engineer I cannot recall a moment I felt better for my job.

Then I joined a team that's extremely important to Facebook's revenue. A mistake in the code I changed could cause Facebook million dollar a day. However Facebook just trusted us, allowed us making mistake and having quick iteration cycles to test ideas fast. If I make a coding mistake in my team in Google it might cost Google nothing in terms of revenue as my product was small, however the development process was so strict I could not have chance to try my innovations or test my ideas. But in Facebook that's all possible.

2. The organizational structure
Google's organization is now very structured and hierarchical. Facebook is having more layers, but the working style is still flat, and social-network style. Speaking to people in different teams, form an idea, lead a virtual team and complete it, this style is still valued. My boss is more like a mentor helping me navigating through the ideas, rather than an authority telling me what to do.","1. I don't quite like the office decoration style. A little bit stressful and factory like.
2. The compensation is better than Google but not as good as other smaller companies.

Hiring manager seemed excellent, direct colleagues were mostly collaborative and kind. Some high quality talent, and leading research in many top fields.","Part of the November 2022 layoffs, Meta recruited me from a role I enjoyed so I was essentially ""hired to fire"", morale was absolutely horrendous with ample signs of project hoarding out of fear, territoriality, and overall gloominess, the number of management layers (back then) was almost comical, including Director-level middle managers of very questionable experience (e.g. Director A with background in politics and no tech experience acting like the stereotypical ""I'm type A""-tough, Director B who was key for specific projects yet acted like their calendar was presidential-grade and never showed up, etc.).

There is a complete lack of transparency and everything can change on a dime, which it makes it difficult to have stability in your own life, which thus makes all the 'perks' that bit more redundant.

It is a highly political environment, in the sense that it is more important who you know, than how you perform your work. The performance review was a jock, with senior management getting into the tool and changing performance ratings without even knowing who the employee is. Meta  terminated 21,000.

Meta,5,1-May-15,Landslide win over Google for career growth,Software Engineer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Menlo Park, CA","I just left Google and joined Facebook, and felt so much happier. The reasons are:

1. The real impact
At Google I joined a team whose product is only used by less than 1000 people, and even for that product I was assigned to do a peripheral part, whose functionality actually doesn't matter at all. Just for that module, I had to write unit test for every silly part of the code, and took long iteration cycles. I admit those are good engineering coding trainings, however taking precious time in my life to work on something that doesn't matter is just a waste of my life.

In Facebook things just move so much faster. There are standard software engineering review process but not as rigid. Just during training (boot camp) weeks, I had tasks to change very important part of Facebook's core code, and the second day after I check-in my code, it got shipped to almost 1 billion people. As a software engineer I cannot recall a moment I felt better for my job.

Then I joined a team that's extremely important to Facebook's revenue. A mistake in the code I changed could cause Facebook million dollar a day. However Facebook just trusted us, allowed us making mistake and having quick iteration cycles to test ideas fast. If I make a coding mistake in my team in Google it might cost Google nothing in terms of revenue as my product was small, however the development process was so strict I could not have chance to try my innovations or test my ideas. But in Facebook that's all possible.

2. The organizational structure
Google's organization is now very structured and hierarchical. Facebook is having more layers, but the working style is still flat, and social-network style. Speaking to people in different teams, form an idea, lead a virtual team and complete it, this style is still valued. My boss is more like a mentor helping me navigating through the ideas, rather than an authority telling me what to do.","1. I don't quite like the office decoration style. A little bit stressful and factory like.
2. The compensation is better than Google but not as good as other smaller companies.
3. Despite good acquisitions for solidify the position in social media, social networks, there is still uncertainty about the future of this company."

Some people create projects to serve their own purpose and pressure everyone else to meet their targets. Sometimes people would create a large project and leave for better offer. It can be very chaotic. This company does not seem to value running a smooth operation, they expect everyone to perform like a unicorn. 'Meets all expectations' somehow is not good enough, everyone is striving for 'Exceed' ' Greatly Exceed' or 'Redefined'. It can be very exhausting and disingenuous.

No longer were you acknowledged for the amazing work you do or the teams you are building from the ground up, but based off of who on the VP team likes you. You were praised for how much noise you made VS the actual work you were able to accomplish. ""Year of efficiency"" and focusing on ""impact"" means that important work was either being cancelled or forcibly distributed amongst other teams.

One good thing is if you are a recent graduate here you can get some experience granted they find a decent project for you. Get ready to lie. Yes lie! Infosys’s managers will ask you to bump up your experience, even if you have none, just so they could charge clients more for your spot.","Does not matter how hard you work your work will not be appreciated. Yes you will get a pat on your back but that’s it. Does not matter if you spend extra time after work hours, does not matter if the client is super happy with you and keeps sending emails to Infosys praising your work. None of it matters you will only get your standard 1.5 or 3% increase. Which to most people will be around 1700-1800$
 Actually if you do good and client is happy with you Infosys will charge the client more after first 6month and they will keep increasing charge without rewarding you.
They typically charge 3 to 4 times of what they pay you. Yes you are reading it right. Infosys will pay you around 30$ per hour BUT will charge clients 90-120$ bucks per hour per one fresher and then at the end of the year they will give you 0.45 cents increase.

- Uncertain living expectations; depending on contracts you may be expected to move anywhere within the country within days, and you will need to pay for this upfront. Be sure to keep all receipts as they are terrible about reimbursing for things that they do not have multiple proof of purchase artifacts for. They also have limits to how much they reimburse which you have to find on your own.
- They do not help very much with career advancement. They have certain classes you can take that give you badges, but these classes often feel like a waste of time as much of what you need to learn on a job is gained through experience.

Infosys,2,9-Feb-24,The worst communication,Consultant,Current Employee,,"Paid on time, job is secure due to high turnover.  Managers are flexible with time off.","Leadership with no leadership or soft skills. Managers do not want you to go to them but that ypu like crap if you go above them. Nothing is communicated but team is expected to know the things that are not communicated. No written processes or good on boarding or training plans. Low to no raises, no bonuses. Required to pay for things and told I'd get reimbursed and no reimbursement. You're required to contact someone in India for laptop issues. It took 38 calls and over a week to get a resolution. Huge headache."
Infosys,5,1-Jan-24,Overview experience,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Bengaluru,"Pros of Infosys working culture include a strong emphasis on learning and development, a global work environment, and opportunities for career growth. Cons may involve high workload at times and challenges related to maintaining work-life balance. It’s essential to consider individual preferences and priorities when evaluating the overall fit with Infosys’ culture.","Cons of Infosys working culture may include occasional high-pressure work situations, a fast-paced environment that might not suit everyone, and the need to adapt to frequent changes in project assignments. Some employees may also find the hierarchical structure challenging. It's crucial to assess these aspects based on personal preferences and career goals."

Infosys,5,15-Oct-23,infosys pros and cons,System Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Pune,"Global Presence: Infosys has a widespread global presence, with offices and development centers in several countries. This global footprint allows them to serve clients from various regions. Reputation: Infosys has a strong reputation in the IT industry for delivering quality services and innovative solutions. Their track record often attracts large enterprises. Talent Pool: The company hires some of the best talents in the industry, ensuring that clients have access to skilled professionals and experts in various domains. Diverse Services: Infosys offers a wide range of services, including IT consulting, software development, maintenance, and outsourcing services. This diversity allows them to cater to different client needs.","Price: Being a prominent IT company, Infosys' services can be relatively expensive for smaller businesses or startups. Cost-effectiveness might be a concern for some clients. Dependency on H-1B Visas: Infosys, like many other Indian IT companies, heavily relies on H-1B visas to bring skilled workers to the United States. Changes in visa regulations can impact their workforce and operations. Workload and Employee Pressure: There have been reports of high-pressure work environments and long working hours in some Infosys offices, which can lead to employee burnout and dissatisfaction. Competitive Market: The IT industry is highly competitive, and Infosys faces stiff competition from other global IT giants. Adapting to market trends and staying ahead of the competition is a constant challenge."

Oracle,5,2-Jan-24,Excellent Learning Opportunities,Principal Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Raleigh, NC","Oracle offers great opportunities for learning new skills. Tuition reimbursement assists with higher education costs outside of the company. Internally, employees have access to a multitude of training modules. Work-life balance is important to the culture.",Moving to another department generally requires approval from your current manager.
Oracle,4,21-Oct-14,"Great benefits, good people, slow innovation, no raises",Technical Analyst III (Support),"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Denver, CO","Every group/division can be different in how they treat their employees, but I'd say overall there is very good atmosphere of trust and fairness. There is a strong focus on education, and they reimburse for outside classes taken (Up to 5k/year I think). Benefits are good, and I'd say quite competitive in the market. Good 401K matching (they'll contribute a max of 3% of your 6% or greater). Free drinks in the breakroom. Flexibility to work from home at times. (If you live 50+ miles away from an office you can work full-time from home...policy).","They don't try to make the workplace anything special (maybe a pool table and arcade game are cliche or gimmicky?). In the 10 years I've worked there, they've given 2 measly %1 cost of living raises (this is the same with most everyone I've spoken to, some don't get any raises). You will not get a substantial raise ever, unless you leave then get rehired on (they will not match offers, better to leave). New employees that you train will make 10 - 20K more than you several years after you hire on (not just me, they do this to all tenured employees). They will give these untrained, less experienced people higher titles (again this is done to everyone not just me). You learn pretty quickly that you're dispensable. The company has billions in cash and they don't re-invest in their employees, just in acquiring new companies and hiring new people that know nothing that you get to train."

OCI and Apps","Old guard is the weakest link if they have never left to experience other companies’ culture, management styles, and returned to Oracle. 

HR empowers and protects short-sighted, insecure, transactional Toxic Management at the cost of sales flight risk and long term customer satisfaction 

Senior Management P & P are inconsistent and transactional. They are not monitored by Sales Excellence for consistency in Oracle culture, communication, and team KPIs. 

Constant layoffs and reorgs

Quarter close is transactional; steamroll 

Customers are valued as a transaction not as a strategic investment 

ASMs are constantly rotated through accounts 

Tenured employees are intentionally paid low base salaries unless they leave Oracle and return 

Cutthroat culture: no trust among multiple product lines, Cloud, ASMs, BDRs, and cross product leadership

Club is held in Vegas immediately before Vegas-based Users Conference. Many multi -year club winner ASMs and many Sales leaders are boycotting it, since Oracle post COVID is refusing to properly invest in a Tier 1 Club nor to pay for “significant others” to attend. 

Quotas don’t take into consideration that in some industries, Customers are fed up with siloed cutthroat Oracle go-to-market. Many legacy customers are instructed by procurement to go out to bid for lower cost options, supported by customer-friendly account management and value-based commercial terms."

Make sure your managers love you and you will be loved back. When the stress from upper mgt trickles down to you, just say ""you're right and thank you for pointing that out"". it's that kinda org...","Mess up? prepare for hell and daily threats of getting fired with reminders of how useless you are. Their training programs are ineffective, you only learn from yourself or your peers, you have to pave your own way. 
It doesn't get any more traditional in terms of climbing up the ladder here, You have to keep a bragging report of your achievements, and network your way in. And people have to like you to get promoted, your numbers are not enough.. people with less achievements have gotten early promos that don't make sense. Stress is insane here.. you can see fear in your manager's eyes and tone... Your managers will tell you one thing and deny it the second their upper manager tells them otherwise because everyone is THAT afraid to make a mistake here. Employee Morale is continuously surprising us how low it can go, Goooooooooooood luck :)
Also forget bout taking holidays because you'll need the numbers to prove it & even if you're fine.. you'll be terrified about how to compensate the days 'wasted' on rest."
Oracle,3,30-Jan-24,This company will slowly take advantage of you as your career stalls and workload increases,Business Analyst,Current Employee,"Austin, TX","Good pay, many of our support teams are remote, and you don't need much tech knowledge. Aside from Excel, most of our tools are built and developed in-house, so you don't need a degree in IT or coding knowledge to work as a business analyst with finance and sales data","It's a well known ""secret"" that the only way to get a pay increase is to leave the company, then get rehired for the same role as an ""outside hire."" This is mind-boggling and leads to a massive brain drain throughout the year. One reason for this is because bonuses and raises are not a thing; you do not have a performance review and there are no career milestones to work towards (leading to, effectively, a dead-end job). Finally, most operation teams are seriously overworked. This is caused by people leaving (probably to seek more pay) and management ""temporarily"" giving their workload to someone else on the team while they ""find a replacement."" This never happens; I know some teams that shrank from 10 to 6 analysts and stayed like that for years. And no, we do not get more pay with these increased workloads (trust me, I've asked)"
Oracle,2,2-Feb-24,Average Big Tech Experience,Principal Program Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Washington, DC","Depending on which line of business you work in, you might get unlimited PTO. Which makes the North American winter break period a plus instead of a minus.

Benefits are decent, with notable extras like gympass. And a decent amount set aside for training. 

Employee Resource Groups are an excellent way to network and meet other colleagues in the MNC.","Oracle has a tendency to buy up everything and just hope for the best when it comes to integrating those new companies into the new parent company. What you end up with is a hodge podge of fragmented businesses that don't know how to work together.

Also, Oracle loves doing silent layoffs to keep out of the news. So they cut just enough to not activate the WARN Act -- usually right before a quarterly earnings call or during the beginning of a new fiscal year. If you work here, always keep your resume updated."
Oracle,5,14-Feb-24,Love This Company,Contract Administrator,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","San Antonio, TX","Working at Oracle provides a unique and positive experience due to its hybrid model. This approach allows employees the flexibility to balance work and life effectively, fostering a healthier work environment. The unlimited sick time policy demonstrates a commitment to employee well-being, ensuring individuals can prioritize their health without added stress. Moreover, the culture of treating employees like adults creates a sense of autonomy, promoting a collaborative and respectful atmosphere. Overall, these factors contribute to a workplace that values work-life balance, health, and a mature approach to professional relationships.",The only downside of the hybrid model is having to come into the office twice a week. The volume of work can get overwhelming at times due to complexity and dollar value. Quarter end months tend to be extremely busy and can leave you feeling completely drained.
Oracle,3,16-Feb-24,"Terrible management, terrible compensation",Senior Principal Consultant,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,The benefit package offered was good. There was an opportunity to learn a lot and develop skills.,"Coworkers who had less experience were hired in at higher rates. When I tried to negotiate based on this knowledge, I was not offered anything better. The consulting practice manager would brag about his bonuses and how he was able to order fancy cars, high end watches, and build additions onto his home. It was completely inequitable.

Opportunity to learn about excellent but very complex products. Great resume entry. Good insurance and stock buys options. Oracle used to have the philosophy, “Find all your smartest friends and get them to come work here.”, but I haven’t heard anyone say that in more than a decade.","In the 15+ years I was there, most of the time we had headcount and salary freezes. I started as a trainee, but despite more than qualifying was never given promised non-trainee status and $25k raise because of constant freezes. Getting re-hired for an open position took eight months because of freezes. To get a promotion I had to leave the company for a few years. The team I came back to never saw raises, not even COLA, and our team was paid noticeably under professional averages. I had some great managers, very admirable, who also weren’t getting raises. Constant posturing and direction changes for Wall Street but not much substance support. Frequent layoffs so no one felt secure. Toward the end of my tenure they removed support for a large percentage of paying customers who didn’t want to move to the Cloud (often for very good reasons). Oracle will take all of your time if you let it - it’s up to you to draw life boundaries and hope your manager will support you. It used to be a much more diverse place, but once the post-1990’s layoffs started it’s become whiter and more male."

Oracle,2,8-Feb-24,"NetSuite - Decent Compensation, Highly Questionable Culture",Emerging Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"Excellent introductory sales training, accessible leadership, young energetic workforce, lots of company networking events, multiple offices, strong compensation plan. You can make a lot of money at this job, just be prepared to work extremely hard as an account executive.","There are a few things that really soured my experience working at this company.


Territories are wide open and NetSuite places hundreds of reps in a free for all in each territory. This breeds a cut throat culture amongst the reps. If you take this role you will be subject to reps trying to steal leads that fall out of your name. If you are an outside hire you are at an immediate disadvantage as internal promotes have had years of practice within the CRM already and are akin to taking leads from their peers and finding ways to funnel new leads away from other reps just to themselves. 

Which brings up another part of the job that really brought down my motivation. Top performing reps in recent time figured out ways to funnel hot inbound leads away from our inbound queue that is supposed to fairly distribute each of these leads as they come in and had them only funneled to themselves. Either by creating searches to get in front of these leads unfairly before they were distributed or getting an assigned BDR to do it for them under the table. 

It was revealed that all of our top performing reps had been practicing this. Which lead to around 10 or so reps per region closing all the large inbound deals leaving the rest to fend for themselves and scrape up anything they can. 

Finally, only around 20% of the entire sales team hit quota last year, partly due to top reps gaming the CRM system and funneling every single good inbound lead to themselves. 

Leadership fully ignored this and instead of punishing those reps in question, gave them a slap on the wrist and promoted them. 

NetSuite is a sink or swim company with surface level ""nice guy"" corporate behavior to mask the deeply negative leadership backroom politics that take place. Favoritism, lead sniping and inbound engagement malpractice run rampant. 

I guess this can come with being such a large company. After the Oracle purchase NetSuite really evolved from a cool start up type company to a corporate beast where you're more focused on infighting with your co-workers than actually closing business with prospects on the outside. 

On top of they have an extremely keen focus on tracking metrics and micromanaging your day to day. There were leaders who were 2-3 levels above managers looking at reps day to day performances. Also, you're ability to move within the company is currently very limited. You can apply to 10+ roles within oracles opportunity market and not get a single chance to interview even if you personally reach out to the hiring managers. 

Be cautious when accepting a role here. It's a smile at your face while stabbing you in the back culture grindfest and it will not be fixed any time soon."
Oracle,2,9-Jan-24,"Good potential, falls way short",BDR,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"Great coworkers in the BDR program, and good training. All the benefits that come with the job and great as well.","BDR management is awful. The entire process of working here has been frustrating. Even if you hit your quotas, serve over your supposed tenure, and overachieve in qualifying / bringing in new business, it won’t help you get promoted. Leadership plays favorites from what was once a “promote everyone” mindset. They over hired unqualified people, and now that sales are down (due to a combination of external factors as well), the rest of the BDR organization has to suffer. BDRs are deceived into thinking they still have a chance at promotion before getting handed an excuse that there were only 2 spots that went to more unqualified leadership favorites (this happened pretty much monthly). I’d rather have committed to a different program if I had known how unreliable NetSuite was."

I was promoted quickly from a BDC to Inside Sales Rep. There are some great leaders in the company who truly care about others and their success. World class sales training program and plenty of good people. The 12 week training is perfect for those shifting from college into the workforce.","I worked in the public sector organization. The women on the team made $19000 less base salary than the men on the team. ($52500 versus $71000 approx). Total commission 2-3% on deals worth from $1-$250000). With other factors such as tenure, experience, and average age of the team considered, I still found this to be a striking difference in pay. Another note, Oracle always will pay a higher base to those hired externally at the Inside Sales level and up (about 15-20%). Also, the products/services don’t always work."

Meaning that if you don’t work there for at least 4 years, Oracle is entitled to take back a majority of their matched contributions to your 401k. They made sure to emphasize the company matching % all throughout the hiring/onboarding process, but did not put the same energy into emphasizing that you only get to keep it all if you work there for 4 years. It just rubbed me the wrong way a little. Since this is many people’s first job out of college, many if not all of my former coworkers that I talked to were unaware of this."

Oracle,1,17-Oct-23,Stay far away!,Customer Support Technician,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,Offers the typical corporate benefits that all other companies offer. Nothing special.,"Leadership: The leadership at my site, Baptist Health, is the worst I've ever witnessed in my long IT career. Decisions are based on C-suite knee-jerk reactions to minor incidents with total disregard for any other high-priority projects. This causes much frustration and confusion for the teams that actually do the work and do not sit in meetings all day. Pay: The pay is insulting and way below par for the work performed and the industry. Unless you are in a ""leadership"" position. Also, there isn't a pay raise in sight. Opportunity: There is no training provided for any current role and they seem to only hire from the outside versus hiring those ready to move up in the company. If you are lucky enough to obtain a position internally, you will not receive a pay raise of any sort. Communication: Each day is served with several fire alarms because nobody communicates regardless of all of the meetings about meetings.

The role in micron is my first full time job after college. And I have felt challenged at work along with at peace at mind. Micron has given me several opportunities to showcase what I can bring to the table and to the big picture, along with providing me necessary feedbacks and pats on the back whenever necessary. The availability of the variety of challenges I can take on, the youthful peer group and workforce, senior managers and directors always there for doubt clarification and guidance, all have added to my very good first 6 months here.","For someone who wants to escalate quickly through the ranks of corporate world, Micron might be a little slowpaced.

You've been warned,Yield Enhancement Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Manassas, VA",You get paid every 2 weeks and may learn a thing or two about semiconductors. That's the only pro you get working here.,"The culture is EXTREMELY TOXIC with ass-licking coworkers and micromanagement to the highest level. Plus layoffs now and then.

Coworkers can't communicate to save their lives but are constantly in your business and gossip a lot. They would rather go to your boss about an issue that involves you than come to you directly to discuss it. So Childish! Everyone is out for themselves to get promoted (which rarely happens) and will find a scapegoat to bully for that. 

Diversity? lol. They purposely hire a bunch of foreigners hoping to trap them with sponsorship and will delay it to keep them stuck due to high turnover. lmao. 

The cafeteria food sucks. The interior of the building is so old, it's depressing going to work. The tools at YE break down constantly and they ship down old used tools from other micron sites to replace them. A company worth billions can't even afford a microscope, it's hilarious LOL. Your 12-hour shifts will be spent waiting on a broken tool that can't take clear images. And they'll make you feel like micron is all you have and that you won't be able to get any opportunities elsewhere. YOU WILL!

The best thing I did was leave quickly and take a better opportunity elsewhere. I get good benefits, work-life balance, AMAZING coworkers, and higher pay at my new job. 

For new grads, take it, stay a year or two, and get the hell out!"

Stable job.","I did not think Micron will have cons, but comparing to Infineon and Globalfoundaries which are also in downturn and doing badly, Micron has developed many cons in last 2 years
1. Salary is VERY low compared to market. 
2. Micron prefers fresh hires and don't adjust salary compared to youngsters or Fresh Hires. This pay revision cycle I got 3% raise compared to my junior who got 9% raise. Both of us no promotion and but of us high rating of 4. So you can see clear differentiation. 
3. No OT allowed to enter, even if you work extra hours. No time-off and no compensation of any kind. 
4. No Micron points (Bravo) anymore. So if you collaborate with other teams, the maximum you will get is a stupid email of appreciation. No spot bonus also. 
5. Biggest issue of all: no FAIR promotion. The people who get promoted are those have HIGH visibility and those who impress bosses. Cliche roles like automation which do not see immediate gains, will be ignored."

SAP,3,22-Jan-24,Leadership is failing its employees in 2024,Director,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",,"Over 10 years at SAP and I have found my colleagues to be incredibly smart and dedicated. The work is fascinating. Up until this year, I would have also (and have) said top leadership generally strives to take care of its employees as much as it can though that is no longer the case, sadly.","The executive leadership has completely disconnected itself from the reality of the post-COVID workspace. They lost all compassion for employees and now follow their own desires and feelings of how work ""should be"" rather than considering actual data when it comes to making decisions that affect the lives of their employees and their work productivity. They have abandoned SAP's sustainability goals. They have abandoned SAP's D&I goals."
SAP,1,10-Jan-24,Betrayal at SAP,Sales Advisor,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",,"I've loved SAP for the last 15 years. They typically do a great job with DEI, purpose, health and wellness, etc.","The SAP Executive Board betrayed its 100,000+ employees on January 9th, 2024, at 12:02 Pacific Time. We received a notification that employees must work in the office three days per week even though we have been a remote culture for at least 15 years. 

Most employees at SAP joined, at least in part, because we had a remote culture. For many years, our LOBs actively supported remote work. We've never discriminated against WFH employees. We had a remote work culture before COVID, and it was critical to the ease with which we navigated the pandemic. Nobody expected the executive board to betray our culture and people like this.

Realistically, I suspect this is all an attempt for SAP to avoid laying people off two years in a row. If they institute a 3-day-in-office policy, they darn well know that a significant percentage of its population will quit. What a shame. I'll probably be amongst them if this policy goes into effect for real in May.

Workday and Oracle Recruiters, get ready! You'll have your pick of the litter as soon as this policy goes into effect. Many of us will probably jump sooner.

SAP, prepare for the brain drain. What a shame. I loved this company."

- if you’re in the first 10 years of your career there is tremendous opportunity to move into different types of roles
- when layoffs happen (inevitable in tech) they’re very supportive to affected people and include transition assistance","- re-orgs every year
- if you love your role it could change even if you don’t want it to

- there is no CRM or knowledge of accounts - it’s excel.
- there is no strategy regarding territory assignments
- they have eliminated spiffs and accelerators
- the culture has gone from okay to terrible
- customers are being bludgeoned to select RISE erp even when not a fit and the company has truly only released only smoke and mirrors innovation since 2020."
SAP,4,31-Jan-24,Nice place to work,Product Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Palo Alto, CA","Working at SAP offers numerous advantages, including its global presence, commitment to innovation and technology, and a diverse and inclusive workforce. Employees benefit from career development opportunities, comprehensive benefits, and a strong emphasis on work-life balance. SAP's corporate social responsibility initiatives contribute to a positive impact on communities and the environment. The company fosters an inclusive culture that values the contributions of all employees and promotes collaboration. SAP's recognition and rewards programs, continuous learning culture, and innovative workspaces further contribute to a positive and fulfilling work environment.","Cons of SAP may include complexity in implementation, high costs for small businesses, potential for system customizations, a steep learning curve, and occasional challenges in customer support responsiveness."

SAP,2,12-Jan-24,"Used to be awesome, seems to be going dowhill fast",Senior Consultant,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","New York, NY","My colleagues and managers. Most SAP employees are incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, and fun to be around. Worklife balance historically has also been pretty good. Although I fear that with recent changes, the culture will change for the worse.","Recently released a sweeping mandate requiring ALL employees globally to be in-office 3 days per week. Will be implementing a stricter performance review policy, and they effectively eliminated our employee appreciation tool. Feels like the company is regressing to an ""old-school"" culture, as they are doing away with everything that made SAP a great place to work. The historically very positive culture is deteriorating fast, and morale is low."
SAP,2,30-Jan-24,Change is needed in the sales org,Sr Sales Executive,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,Large company with a significant amount of internal support for the sales org. The benefits are very good in my opinion as well. Sr leadership has a decent vision of where the company is going and needs to get to. SAP hods a high amount of dominance in the ERP space globally. The partner network int he US and globally is very strong as well with a lot of options and niches available to the diverse portfolio of companies who use SAP products.,"Sales mgmt needs a complete overhaul. It's still very much a ""boys club"" with an extreme amount of corporate politics. The goals are unrealistic, yet the company still shows it's making their number. This is due to the company placing a higher quota on the sales org than the companies anticipated financial performance. There is a significant gap in the ""haves and have nots"" amongst sakes reps. 
Not all territories are created equal by a long shot. It takes a long time to build up a pipeline and close deals. If you are not making your number or very close to it within a year, you WILL be managed out, even if you're on the uptick. Managers will remove s significant number of reps on their team and the company will not even consider looking at the leadership qualities / styles of its sales management. Lastly, the training is lacking. The expectation is what I would call, trial by fire. In my first year, I wasn't shown a demo of the core product itself. The HR department is negligent at best. HR complaints almost always side with the company even though they boast of policies in place to support and protect employees. Extremely hypocritical. I've witnessed numerous cases of this in my 5+ years with SAP. Lastly, you're expected to work 40+ hours consistently. I was told numerous times since I've been here...this is NOT a 40 hour a week job, period."" There is little to no life balance, but yet we are told this is ""being worked on"" at Sr leadership levels. Certainly NOT in the sales org."

Dell is known for its commitment to technological advancement, and this role allows professionals to actively contribute to groundbreaking ideas and solutions.

Cross-Functional Collaboration: Working closely with cross-functional teams, including engineers, designers, marketers, and researchers, fosters a diverse and dynamic work environment. This collaboration encourages the exchange of ideas and perspectives, leading to well-rounded product development.

Career Growth: Dell offers excellent opportunities for career growth and professional development. As a Product Innovation Specialist, you have the chance to gain expertise in cutting-edge technologies and play a crucial role in shaping the company's future direction.

Impactful Work: The role provides a sense of purpose, as professionals in this position have a direct impact on the products Dell delivers to customers. Bringing innovative solutions to market can be highly rewarding, knowing that your contributions enhance the lives of technology users.","High Expectations: With a focus on innovation comes high expectations. Pressure to constantly generate novel ideas and solutions can be demanding, and the need to meet ambitious targets may lead to stressful situations.

Uncertainty: The tech industry is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. This can lead to uncertainty in the market, which may affect job stability, especially if innovative projects face unexpected challenges or market shifts.

Work-Life Balance: In the pursuit of innovation, professionals in this role may sometimes need to work long hours or deal with tight deadlines. Maintaining a healthy work-life balance can be challenging during particularly intense project phases.

Resource Constraints: Innovation often requires substantial resources, and there may be constraints in terms of budgets, time, or available talent. Finding creative solutions within these constraints can be a demanding aspect of the job."

- The work from a software engineering point of view is probably the worst thing about the company. Depending on team, like the one I'm on, the tasks and features are so basic and require such little engineering skills that you become worse as a developer. This is a big problem that many have come to realise and for someone starting out in their career can be damaging when you want to soak up as much skills as possible. You just won't get that here!
- IT constantly make changes and updates which block you from doing work and can take weeks to sort out.
- Principle devs have a habit of pushing un-reviewed and untested code which causes so many problems. Literally weeks are lost each year because of this.

Some leadership is cool and will listen but for the most part, your manager cant' save you.

The senior VP constantly brags about how much money he makes and all of the vacations he takes while the rest of us are barely scraping by to pay our rent. According to him we are the ones to blame for the state of the company, not the fact that their constant bad policy updates and high turnover rates make it impossible to move up and succeed. It is an absolute miracle if you make it through your first year at Dell. Don't expect to make money either, even if you over attain your unrealistic quota you're making 60k at best.

This is the company when they need to cut the cost they remove all their technical people first and those who are not licking boots they will be first to let go. In my last 12 years never saw any Sr. Dir or Dir's asked to let go. Most Org's have incompetent resources and they are just there to conduct meetings. Most Senior Architects are there to take credit of Junior Resources. The year 2024 Buzzword is AI and GenerativeAI and all Directors and Sr. Dir's keep taking the same buzz words in every call and after 1-2 year everyone start talking about some other things.

In addition, there is clear favoritism/outright fudging of numbers and cheating that almost everyone participates in to meet their assigned metrics. Very low lead count with many being terrible and outdated leads. Other red flags include Dell being so pro-remote only to take that away this year even though sales peaked in COVID, required work outings, and more that I'm sure I'm missing.

I am an experienced executive with several years in my professional career and I can say with confidence that this is the most negative experience of my career. 

Capgemini is incredibly dysfunctional which I attribute to its size and quality of its leaders. Everyone is incredibly uncollaborative, unsupportive, and outright unprofessional. Don't expect any meaningful onboarding, you are expected to just ""figure it out"". Once you do have a few months under your belt, collaborating with anyone is incredibly challenging. No one is motivated to work with one another, no one returns emails and phone calls, and leadership models this negative behavior on a consistent basis. 

Beyond this, Capgemini is predominantly South Asian (I would venture to say over 90%). As such, if you are not a part of that clique it will be difficult to be treated with respect and given equal treatment. If you are a more junior employee, you will be treated like one. Your perspectives and experience will not be valued. More so, you will have client access restricted and skipped over for opportunities. I observed this to be even more severe for females."

It’s goes beyond just unpleasantness and being “toxic.” I wish I had spoken to an employment lawyer during my time at Cap. The project leads are usually narcissists who have no qualms about lying to your face and making you responsible for their mistakes.

They will lie and tell you that you gain increase in pay upon positive annual review... What they don't tell you is that even if you do get a good annual review there's no guarantee you get pay raise... might as well expect it to simply not happen unless you get promoted instead... but to what when there's no roles available to get promoted to?

Salesforce,4,9-Jul-14,"Still a lot of opportunity to learn, connect, and chart your own course, but Big Company culture is encroaching.",Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","San Francisco, CA","I've spent over 8 years with Salesforce in various management and individual contributor roles, all customer or partner facing. Some of the pros:
- vibrant, fast paced culture 
- smart, fun, aggressive colleagues
- management is focused on latest tech trends and staying or becoming a leader for many of them
- by and large, customers and partners are very positive about the technology
- good benefits and perqs
- hip urban culture at HQ
- a chart-your-own-course mentality that rewards those who aggressively seek out the job they want and pursue it, or sometimes even create it","After my long tenure and many Dreamforce conferences, I'm nearly fried. To say the culture is fast paced and the focus is always changing is an understatement. The reason Salesforce always seems on top, and chasing the latest trend, and in the press, is because employees are expected to run harder, carry more, cheer loudly, and pivot constantly. It's the world's biggest startup in behavior. But at the same time, with the recent influx of top career sales leaders from Oracle and what appears to be a board-level mandate for doubling revenue, employees are being asked to do even more with even less, fill higher quotas with smaller territories, less help, and the big company bureaucracy is rearing it's ugly head. 

Worse still is the politics. When you hire a bunch of smart, aggressive people, and put them in an environment of outsized expectations, throw in a bunch of re-orgs and changing management,  and sprinkle with uncertainty and constantly changing priorities, you inevitably get people back stabbing each other and throwing others under the bus to appear smarter and more worthy of promotion. 

The few at the top will get very, very rich. The rest will lose the sense of personal ownership and start to wonder why they've given up health and family"

- generous maternity/paternity leave. Although this will affect your likelihood of be promoted","I came into Salesforce like every rep, excited and eager to get my “MBA” in sales. Working here you’ll have to be prepared to give up everything just to stay afloat. In the first year you will most likely be given a terrible territory and what you do with it will decide your future here. Things you will need to juggle effortlessly or will lead you down the road of being let go are:

- Activity- lots of calls. People who fib numbers here are celebrated by leadership but frowned upon by reps
- Opp rigor- the amount of fields you will need to update are mind numbing
- Pipeline- with a terrible territory be prepared to pipe aspirational pipeline that will be highly scrutinized
- Prep meetings- there are endless prep meetings before calls. Due to schedules each person involved will require a prep meeting, leaving your day with little time for anything else.
- Team selling- be prepared to sell with folks much junior than you and not held to as high of standards. If the deal falls through, it’s on you. There are a few coprimes that are skilled sales reps
- Your “brand”- It’s important to maintain appearances, even on bad days. Your brand is determined by how involved you are in diversity, volunteer work, and leading the team, which requires tenure.
-Manager 1:1’s- these are a trap to look out for. Salesforce preaches trust as one of it pillars, but beware that everything said in those meetings will be used against you when they have soured on you
- Time management- working a 12 hr day is table stakes. There are endless distractions you will need to navigate and make hard decisions on “brand”/ appearance maintenance vs selling

The work/life balance is very heavy on the work side. The exec team repeatedly say their biggest regrets are not spending enough time with family. This will never change if they don’t take it serious. There is a lot you can learn here but at the expense of your self confidence as some managers make you feel worthless when your awful territory isn’t performing. If that isn’t enough to make you steer clear, the pay is very low and less than 20% of reps hit their annual numbers

The “Ohana” culture is a mirage. There is nothing remotely familial about the culture. It is an ultra competitive pressure cooker. I just had such higher hopes for my experience left disappointed..."

Exceptional Colleagues: The company is home to an incredibly talented pool of individual contributors, who are not only skilled in their respective fields but also collaborative and supportive.

This can hinder innovation and responsiveness to market shifts.

Misaligned Prioritisation: There's a noticeable emphasis on meeting sales targets and quotas, sometimes at the expense of truly addressing customer needs and ensuring their success.

Salesforce,2,21-Jan-24,"Used to be good, now toxic",Lead Member Technical Staff (LMTS),"Former Employee, more than 5 years",,Mostly good co-workers and interesting way to platformize products and solve multi-tenancy.,"Salesforce used to a be good company but changed a lot after the layoffs. Product is scrambling to ship solutions with very little market research. This results in engineers being told that the work is very important but once shipped, these products have 0 customers. There is also a culture of fear- our PM would tell our team that if we don't ship fast, we are all going to get laid off.
Weak and ineffective eng management- did absolutely nothing to address problems and like other reviews have mentioned, any complaints to HR results in a PIP. HR does not care about you or the toxic environment, they will protect your manager. I regularly had things made up about me that were easily refuted by slack conversations and work item comments. No one cares. Your manager can and will destroy you if it furthers their own career. Asking questions is seen as insubordination and will get you fired. As others have pointed out, not a safe place for women who want to further their career. If you are early in your career and ok with working nights and weekend because you are told your product is necessary, only to ship it and have it not sold, this place is for you.
The tech stack is old and can be frustrating at times. I am so glad to be gone. Also, I would be highly skeptical of the 5 star reviews- Salesforce is an aggressive marketer of both its products and culture."

They've also made a huge effort around pay equity. A great place to learn the tried and true industry strategies that work.,"Can be very political. Many middle managers vying for their next promotion instead of coaching their teams and helping them grow in their careers. Depending on the team, promotions seem to be based on who's liked the most and who the squeaky wheel is rather than merit and potential. For many teams, the layoffs have led to losing invaluable product knowledge and organizational chaos. No transparency about how layoff decisions were made. Lots of change management, re-orgs, and title changes causing employees to be forced into new roles they don't want if they want to stay employed. Salesforce shifts gears like a startup - could be good or bad depending on your perspective.

The work is interesting and there are loads of resources to grow personally and professionally… if you have anything left over emotionally to invest in yourself.","Everyone is scrambling to still justify their roles, work and departments to mid level leaders that seem disconnected from the top line decisions being made about programs, people, and layoffs. The result is a “report on everything” culture of micromanagement and having to spend so much time documenting the job it’s hard to find enough time to do the job- let alone engage with ERGs, personal development, or outside of work board positions and volunteering. This period of uncertainty and change makes it hard to get your footing- many people including myself had had 2-3 managers in just the last 8 months."
Salesforce,3,22-Jan-24,Changed Significantly through Covid and beyond,Solutions Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,#NAME?,"- Leadership has been very weak since layoffs, too afraid to stand up for their team or themselves due to fear of layoffs.
- Upward mobility is extremely difficult, be prepared to do the job of a Principal while being compensated for much less. If you want to move up in a company, I cannot suggest Salesforce as it is typically luck of the draw or how you were hired.
- Role expansion with no compensation
- Benefits every year get worse and worse, they are taking things away slowly
- Management/Leaders only care about ""managing up"", be prepared to get minimal assistance from those above you"

Salesforce,1,4-Feb-24,Good luck,Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Seattle, WA",It's a large company with seemingly endless opportunities. The benefits are great.,"Pay leaves a lot to be desired.

There is very little training and development in place within certain orgs, so you need to be self-sufficient.

There are a million levels of middle management, so everyone is a VP of something, and nobody is good at their job.

People in all levels of management within certain orgs are completely incompetent. The Peter Principle is how it is best described.

Everyone there thinks that because they work there, their (blank) doesn't stink. The arrogance is obnoxious.

If you ever need help with anything, don't expect to get helpful answers from anyone. Plan on searching internal systems and learning on your own.

Forget product training. Better use Google and YouTube.

Managers are not your friends, nor are the other employees. If you say something to someone, trust that everyone will know, so keep it related to work.

The people there are only in it for themselves and will happily stab anyone in the back to get what they want.

If you aren't in the inner sanctum, you will feel like an outsider. Very clicky environment."
Salesforce,5,4-Feb-24,Exceptional Employee Experience: A 5-star Journey at Salesforce,Lead Solutions Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","San Francisco, CA","As a proud member of the Salesforce family, I couldn't be more thrilled to share my incredible journey working with this esteemed company. From day one, I've been immersed in a culture of excellence, collaboration, and support that truly sets Salesforce apart as an employer of choice.

1. Generous Employee Benefits: Salesforce's commitment to its employees shines brightly through its comprehensive benefits package. The 6-month parental leave policy is a testament to the company's dedication to supporting work-life balance and family values.
2. World-Class Office Spaces: The work environment at Salesforce is nothing short of breathtaking. With beautifully designed offices and top-notch amenities, every day feels like a step into a space crafted for success and inspiration.
3. Outstanding Work Teams and Culture: One of the standout aspects of working at Salesforce is the opportunity to collaborate with exceptional colleagues who are not just coworkers but also mentors and friends. The culture of inclusivity, innovation, and empowerment fosters personal growth and professional development in ways I never imagined possible.","While my experience at Salesforce has been overwhelmingly positive, it's essential to acknowledge that, like any large enterprise, there are challenges. One notable area for improvement is the complexity of navigating the team structure. At times, it can be daunting to understand where to go or who to connect with, but with the right resources and support, these hurdles become opportunities for growth and learning."
Salesforce,1,12-Feb-24,All time high profits and still doing layoffs!,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"You might get a barista in certain offices. The downside is RTO (despite the data stating people are more productive from home, it's better for their wallets, better for the environment, etc.)","Salesforce will lay off hundreds or even thousands. They won't make any internal communications about it. That's what Salesforce means when they say ""Ohana/family"". After these quiet firings, you can find Tableau executives saying that people upset by the layoffs are children in the wallstreetbets slack channel. 0 emotional intelligence.

Profits are skyrocketing and at an all time high. Yet the greedy executives still want more for themselves and less for everyone else.

Raises are anywhere from 2-7% in my org. High performers get a few measly percents more than everyone else. No RSUs for new hires. What a joke."

They have regular assessments during the probation which adds to the stress of the job. The company undergoes many reorganizational changes regularly which means you could end up with three different managers in a span of two months which causes a strain during onboarding but it is not considered during your assessments. I received a threatening message at 8pm on a friday letting me know that if I fail the assessment I will be fired. I felt lost most of the time and felt like they dint care too much about their new employees. I was regularly made aware that if make a mistake during my probation I will be creating a long lasting bad impression. In the end, I did not fair well in the assessment as I felt the task was set to make me fail. The process felt premeditated with the outcome already decided. I was let go after 3 months of joining.

The culture here is so supportive. PTO is flexible, really depends on your manager but they don't babysit you. As long as you are hitting your numbers, they aren't looking over your shoulder. I am in the SMB new logo sector (arguably the hardest sector for a BDR) but I love the challenge. My manager and director are some of the nicest people I have ever met, and I always feel supported to reach my goals.

Everyone at Salesforce wants you to win (or in my experience) I even flew out to Irvine to meet my AE's and VP's, they all vouched for me and how excited they are for me to get promoted.

Customers who end up purchasing soon realise that it becomes too expensive to implement. See Trustpilot reviews
- Even if you managed to get it running, you will realise that you now need to hire an army of ""Salesforce certified"" developers to operate it. 
- 90% of all SMB accounts sold become red accounts in less than a year and thats when they refuse to pay their bills and send their lawyers to get out of their contract.
- Hit and run deals. You will never hear from the AE that sold to you again. Ask for a free trial of the product not a ""scripted demo"" and to speak to customers as references."

Almost every experience has been scarring. I got to Salesforce with high hopes, but low expectations. I have been here for almost 8 months now, and I could cry because I actually feel like I got it right this time lol. I enjoy coming to work every day- even look forward to it?? The culture here is so supportive. PTO is flexible, really depends on your manager but they don't babysit you. As long as you are hitting your numbers, they aren't looking over your shoulder. I am in the SMB new logo sector (arguably the hardest sector for a BDR) but I love the challenge. My manager and director are some of the nicest people I have ever met, and I always feel supported to reach my goals.

Everyone at Salesforce wants you to win (or in my experience) I even flew out to Irvine to meet my AE's and VP's, they all vouched for me and how excited they are for me to get promoted. I have never been apart of something like that in my life, it just feels good knowing I have a team I can count on.

If you stay organized, hit your metrics, and are continuously hungry to learn... you will thrive here.",Trying to push in office culture a little too much lately. Not allowed to work remote without taking PTO (not sure how long that will last)... that whole bit is confusing.

However, my dissatisfaction primarily due to the flawed Revenue Recognition system, especially within Salesforce where the distinction between Core AE and Specialists AE creates issues. 
Specialists focus on specific solutions, but their numbers are negatively impacted by attrition on unrelated solutions within the same account. This results in absurd scenarios, such as a Pardot AE losing out on revenue recognition despite significant efforts, thanks to attrition in other areas. 

Besides that, the organizational decisions, like unnecessary retrenchment followed by rehiring, showcase a lack of coherent management strategy. 

Additionally, blatant favoritism and frequent restructuring further contribute to an unstable work environment, prompting many to leave due to perceived lack of sales potential and the discrepancy between external appearances and internal realities."

Through roles involving team management and exceeding production standards, I showcased unwavering dedication to excellence. Active participation in client meetings underscored my commitment to client satisfaction, while contributions as a Buganizer demonstrated problem-solving skills. Achievements, including promotions and recognition, reflect consistent performance and acknowledgment as the Best Employee. Eager to leverage this multifaceted skill set, I am ready to contribute to new challenges and future successes.","While my tenure at Wipro has been rewarding, it's important to note potential challenges. Balancing work-life flexibility, especially with varied hours, has been demanding. Client satisfaction, though crucial, introduces a dependency on fluctuating client expectations. Meeting stressful production targets, while showcasing commitment, may impact overall well-being. Limited autonomy in decision-making, particularly as a Single Point of Contact, poses challenges for implementing innovative solutions independently. These cons, however, have been opportunities for growth and continuous improvement."

If you are kind of person who doesn’t want to be bothered by people in organisation then it is heaven to you because then you can follow the culture to not to respond to chats or emails for ages.

If you are applying for management role like Project Management / Account Executive then it is heaven to you because then you have full control and support to use technical resources as puppets.","No professional growth in technical domain in Australia, because there is no dependency on technical peoples here as company has army of technical peoples in India, and you can easily be replaced by offshore people.

There are high chances that you will forget what you used to perform in earlier jobs as there is no real current technical work.

As a full time worker, once your current project is completed, it is super hard to find new project in Australia, high chances of getting redundant."
Wipro,4,12-Jan-24,Unlocking Tech Marvels: TIBCO Developer Gig is a Wild Ride!,Tibco Developer/Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Hyderābād,"High Demand: TIBCO developers are in demand across various industries, ensuring a steady flow of job opportunities.

Versatility: TIBCO's suite of products allows developers to work on diverse projects, gaining expertise in various aspects of integration, analytics, and business process management.

Integration Mastery: TIBCO's strong integration capabilities make developers adept at connecting different systems and technologies seamlessly.

Scalability Challenges: Tackling large volumes of data and transactions in enterprise-level applications provides opportunities for developers to hone their skills in building scalable solutions.

Diverse Toolset: Working with a range of TIBCO tools and technologies exposes developers to a diverse set of skills, contributing to their professional growth.

Competitive Remuneration: TIBCO developers often receive competitive salaries and benefits due to the specialized nature of their skills and the demand for their expertise.

Global Opportunities: TIBCO is used worldwide, offering developers the chance to work on international projects or even consider relocation.","Continuous Learning: Staying current with evolving technologies and industry trends is essential, requiring a commitment to continuous learning.

Specialized Skill Set: TIBCO skills may be highly specialized, limiting career flexibility compared to more general programming languages or frameworks.

Complexity: Handling integration in complex enterprise environments can be challenging and requires a deep understanding of both business processes and technical systems.

Dependency on Company Adoption: Job opportunities may be influenced by the extent to which companies in certain industries adopt TIBCO technologies.

Niche Focus: TIBCO development may be considered niche, potentially limiting the variety of job opportunities available compared to more mainstream technologies.

Project Variation: While some may find the variety of projects exciting, others may prefer a more consistent and predictable workload."

This can help QA testers advance their careers and become more marketable to other companies.
Varied work environment: Wipro has a global presence, so QA testers can work on projects for a variety of clients in different industries. This can provide a lot of variety and help testers to develop a broad range of skills.
Good work-life balance: Many reviewers reported that Wipro has a good work-life balance, with reasonable hours and opportunities for telecommuting or flextime.","Compensation: Some reviewers reported that the compensation at Wipro is not as competitive as at other IT companies.
Bureaucracy: Some reviewers reported that Wipro can be a bureaucratic company, with a lot of red tape to navigate.
Lack of upward mobility: Some reviewers reported that it can be difficult to advance in your career at Wipro, especially if you are not a ""yes man.""
Overall, working at Wipro as a QA tester can be a good option for individuals who are looking for a company with a variety of opportunities for growth and development.

In reality, your career opportunities are dictated to you by a team in India that has zero interest in your passions or skill set. Diversity is shamefully disappointing. Teams do not embrace diversity of backgrounds, and my new ideas were not welcome. Culture is rooted in bullying. I would routinely finish my work by the late afternoon and receuce missed calls from my manager while working out, living my life, etc. To quote the manager, “you get 30min for lunch. 30min for dinner. And the rest of the day you must be available.” He should have simply stated, “you are always responsible for others being terrible at their job.” Senior management is the most pompous, self-important group of people. Even recent hires are guilty of bureaucratic management practices. They’ll spend the entire day peacocking to their bosses boss, manufacturing stress to their direct reports and adding negative value."
Wipro,4,8-Nov-23,A Rewarding experience at Wipro Technologies,Project Engineer,Current Employee,,"Innovative Environment: Wipro places a strong emphasis on innovation, providing employees with opportunities to work on cutting-edge technologies and groundbreaking projects. Learning and Development: The company invests in employee growth through various training programs, workshops, and certifications. This has allowed me to expand my skill set and stay up-to-date with industry trends. Collaborative Culture: Wipro fosters a culture of collaboration, where teams work together seamlessly to achieve common goals. This has created a supportive and friendly work atmosphere. Global Exposure: Wipro is a multinational company with a diverse clientele, providing employees with the chance to work on projects with a global impact and interact with teams from different regions. Work-Life Balance: While the workload can be demanding at times, Wipro generally values work-life balance and provides flexible working arrangements when needed.","Workload Intensity: At times, the workload can be demanding, especially during peak project phases. This may require employees to manage their time and priorities effectively. Hierarchy and Bureaucracy: Like many large organizations, Wipro has a structured hierarchy, which can occasionally lead to bureaucratic processes and decision-making. Client Dependency: Some projects may require extensive client interactions, which can lead to varying levels of engagement and expectations from different clients. Limited Autonomy on Project Selection: As an IT consultant, I found that project assignments are generally determined by client needs and organizational priorities, which may limit personal preferences for project selection. Competitive Industry: The IT consulting industry is highly competitive, and Wipro faces stiff competition from other major players. This can sometimes lead to intense pressure to deliver results."

Good benefits
Career opportunities - New Technologies
Talented individuals are recognized and given good opportunities and benefits.","Mandatory 3 days WFO is Great! but people who commute on bikes are very likely to meet with an accident in cities like Bengaluru where there is huge Traffic problem and employees who commute by car are most likely to spend 3 to 4hrs on road due to traffic. 
And the infrastructure cannot be modified or altered immediately. All IT companies smart heads should get together to find a solution for it. If not, people should be allowed to work from home at least 3 or 4 days a week and be productive, By doing this even the Traffic can be reduced."

I would not work in this company even if they offer me a million dollar. It is like all the roadside labors are just dressed well and working here.
2. You cannot even sleep. Logout at 11pm and login at 5am. Frequent shift changes. Shift changes twice a week = Zero work life balance.
3. Managers are bunch of jerks and they do not know what US client is saying and they ask their subordinates to translate in Telugu what was said by client.
4. Managers glory themselves saying that they work 16 hours and many idiots copy this unhealthy practice to look good. Work same 16 hours and resign due to health issues. 8 hours healthy work is enough. Utilize employee in the shift hours.
5. Open discrimination of contractor employees.
6. Managers cooks stories when US Client ask why so and so person is not in the meeting. Even if the employee is trying to join the meeting, these cunning managers say 'he is on leave today'.
7. No basic support to disabled employee. The wheel chair and security guard are lying wasted near the gate and when disabled employee ask the wheel chair just for a 5 meter distance, they make him more late by asking to send an email and bla bla.
8. You can join this company to experience how bad the work culture can be."

No work life balance. Managers don’t know the art of saying no. Even a small escalation is treated as if it’s life threatening.
Culture has only degraded over the years. It’s no longer the strength of this organization.
Compensation is a joke. Salary parity is an even bigger joke. No one is laughing though. Management is always crying about shortage of funds but ready to hire at insanely high salaries or restruture compensation for a select few (e. g MBA hired) without any regards to the general population."

Complex Organizational Structure: Due to their extensive service portfolio and global operations, their organizational structure can be complex, which may lead to challenges in communication and decision-making. Data Security Concerns: Given the nature of their services, data security is a significant concern for both Wipro and their clients.

I'm a US Citizen and live in New Jersey.

Opportunities for Growth: Wipro provides employees with ample opportunities to grow and develop their skills. The company offers various training programs, mentorship initiatives, and career advancement opportunities to help employees reach their full potential.

Collaborative Work Environment: Wipro fosters a collaborative work environment where teamwork and knowledge sharing are encouraged. Employees have the chance to collaborate with colleagues from diverse backgrounds and expertise, leading to a rich and stimulating work experience.","Work-Life Balance: Like any fast-paced organization, maintaining a work-life balance can sometimes be challenging at Wipro. The nature of the work and client demands may require employees to put in extra hours, which can impact personal time and well-being.

Communication and Transparency: I see the need for improved communication and transparency. Clearer communication channels and more transparency in decision-making processes would enhance employee satisfaction and engagement.

Workload Management: At times, employees may face high workloads and tight timelines. While it can be an opportunity for growth and learning, it is important for the management to ensure a balanced distribution of workload to prevent burnout."

But they are so low as not to announce you being fired, they are forcing you to sign a mutual agreement, where you have to give up your unemployment benefits. They try to do this with zero information given to you, it's impossible to get explanations from HR department even if you ask clearly (it's actually one person and very unqualified). They do not have other projects to assign you, they don't want to deal with legal obligations as to fire you officially, they do not communicate anything openly whilst some of their company values are Transparency and Openness and Communication.

Cisco Systems,4,13-Mar-15,The grass isn't always greener...,"Manager, Network Services","Former Employee, more than 3 years","San Jose, CA","I decided to wait almost a year after leaving the company before posting a review.  The primary reason being is that when you decide to leave an organization it is usually because there is something there that isn't aligning with you or what you want anymore however, the grass is not always greener someplace else.  This has been my experience.  In fact, the appreciation I have for the company has grown so much in my time away that I would really like to return.

The company truly believes on promoting within and as an employee you are encouraged to grow your career within the organization and learn new skills by taking different positions.  Benefits are excellent.  Cisco is the industry leader for networking and now cloud.  It is sometimes easy to forget that on the daily grind but you are working for the company that everyone looks to for network and infrastructure standards.  Culture within the business units managing product lines give you a lot of freedom to be innovative and creative in your approach to your role.  In most cases you are given a fair amount of autonomy and control over how you do your job provided that it aligns with the strategic objectives.  Benefits, 401k match, RSUs and ESPP are amazing.  And while the salaries aren't the top of the industry, they are above market and pretty competitive.","Cisco can be a machine.  There isn't an overt demand for all of your time (even the time outside of work) but more of a subtle, slight encouragement to always be on.  If you are not careful, you will live, sleep and eat Cisco 24x7.  Don't get me wrong, this is 100% a choice and if you are aware of this subtlety in the culture it is very easy to set appropriate boundaries that will be respected by the company and leadership team.

If you don't like where you are in Cisco or what you are working on, give it 6 months because you will be reorg'd.  While it is sometimes necessary to realign the company to meet competitive threats or market demands, reorganizing the company once a year is excessive and tends to create a distrusting environment for the rank and file which makes being a leader in the organize challenging.  There is a loss of momentum and motivation that occurs a few months before and a few months after reorgs so this leaves the company being effective at delivery and execution only about 70% of the time.

While Cisco attracts some bright, motivated people the truth of the matter is you are either cut out for the company and its culture or you're not.  If you aren't it will be painfully obvious to you and those around you.  Sadly as a leader it is hard to cut dead weight from the team and the only really accepted way is via layoffs, which is why the company reorgs once a year despite the company line about the reorgs."
Cisco Systems,3,8-Feb-24,Unpredictable Goals,Account Manager,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Raleigh, NC","The benefits of working at Cisco are what keeps people in seat. Great healthcare, great stock options, great wfh atmosphere. The many different products that Cisco makes allows for account managers to hit their goal from one of their many product lines. The products that Cisco makes are phenomenal.","As a sales rep, you really have no control over what territory you cover, and what accounts you have this year to next. If you are not Enterprise sales rep, you could spend the entire year trying to develop a relationship with an account, only to find out that you no longer cover it when the new fiscal comes around. The goals drastically change, with no warrant to why or how they came up with this number. Finance also will regoal you and keep all your money. Mid-level management also has little to no control or say into how things are managed or done. Cisco sells against itself. Some products compete with each other, as well as some of the programs like NFR give products away."

The management is terrible, incompetent, and unprofessional. They have no clue what they are doing and they constantly micromanage, criticize, and undermine their employees. They also gossip and talk behind people's back too much, spreading rumors and lies about their performance, behavior, and personal lives. My ex manager was a walking HR violation and have made some suggestive advances towards me. They have no vision, no values, and no ethics. 

I would not recommend anyone to work here. They are a nightmare to deal with and they will make your life miserable. They are the worst management I have ever encountered and I hope they get exposed and fired soon"

My (2) teams were comprised of decent folks and I don't think they meant any harm, However they also seemed too busy or unwilling to help me through understanding certain aspects of my job and instead opting to do things themselves giving me very little to do and, thus, not much to learn.

Cisco Systems,4,6-Feb-24,Growing pains,Cybersecurity Specialist,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,Great team and great culture. Generally feel like I have job security in my BU,Cisco acquires a lot of companies and then tries to mesh them all together. This comes with a lot of issues for employees. I've now been here almost 3 years and every single month has been filled with change. I'm fine with change and reasonably adaptable but my org and my job have changed dramatically from the job I originally signed up to work. Our commission payouts have been messed up for over 6 months and the structure has changed to where we make less money than we did in previous years
Cisco Systems,4,21-Nov-23,Great benefits and flexibility,"Leader, Customer Experience","Current Employee, more than 5 years","Chicago, IL","Cisco lives up to a lot of their promises and top level leadership leads by example in encouraging their values. Cisco provides a lot of resources and opportunities to explore what you uniquely bring to your work, lead with your strengths, practice mindfulness, and keep balance and flexibility in your life. It is a place that strives to be welcoming and supportive of diverse communities with a lot of employee resource groups to help. Their benefits are great and receiving 80 hrs per year to volunteer is simply amazing. I hope they don't cut that back.","The PTO is 20 days per year, but you are forced to use 3-4 for those days during the mandatory holiday shutdown period, so the PTO is effectively 16 or 17 days. 
They have had a lot of unannounced layoffs or ""restructuring"" since I joined.
And like any large corporation, a lot of the internal processes and requirements are like navigating a maze to follow. 
It is also very slow to move and coming from an acquisition this was a hard transition. Also, when we were acquired, we thought we would get more resources to help, but that was not the case. 
Despite the ideals for how to be a good leader and make Cisco a great place to work, individual managers may or may not follow, leaving much variability in the working environment on a particular team."

Employee Recognition and Feedback:"
HCLTech,1,17-Jan-24,DONT JOIN HCL EDTECH,Technical Trainer,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",Pune,Good work from home. That’s it.,"My time here was disappointing. Salary was unsatisfactory. Hard work you put in gets no recognition, but being agreeable will. HR here lacks competence. Don't expect to raise a concern because they get defensive as though you have personal issues with them. The worst part is that you can't take leave even if you're entitled to, as you have a balance. They treat you badly like as though you did a bad mistake and if you take leave and will call you even for something unimportant. They expect you to work during weekends with no compensation or extra pay. Working here feels challenging; never join this EduTech in HCL because the leadership is unstable and toxic. You don't know who your client is or what is expected, but they want things delivered quickly without giving decent time to think and gather resources. Planning is so poor that nothing ever anyone does will actually be useful, and every work that you have been breaking your head for will go into the dustbin. Employees below band 3 are treated poorly. My work as a trainer involved travel, and the hotels they book for us are very very bad. Spending a little more won't damage your company financially, especially when you boast that the owners are the richest in India. Treat employees well. Don't keep hiring retired people who contribute nothing, while those doing the hard work are worked like donkeys and have to slog for peanuts. Invest in good people, and you will automatically have good clients. Don't treat youngsters like cheap labor."
HCLTech,5,6-Feb-24,Data Analyst,Data Analyst,Current Employee,,"Global Presence: HCL Tech has a strong global presence with operations in multiple countries, serving clients across various industries. This global footprint allows them to tap into diverse markets and gain insights into different business landscapes.

Innovation Focus: HCL Tech has a strong focus on innovation and has invested significantly in research and development. They have dedicated innovation labs and centers of excellence that focus on emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, and IoT, enabling them to deliver cutting-edge solutions to their clients.","Cultural Challenges: HCL Tech has faced criticism in the past for its work culture, which some employees and observers have described as intense and demanding. The company's emphasis on performance and results can sometimes lead to high-pressure work environments, which may not be suitable for everyone.

Dependency on Outsourcing: Like many other IT services companies, HCL Tech relies heavily on outsourcing, particularly offshore outsourcing to countries like India. While this model offers cost advantages, it can also pose challenges related to communication, coordination, and quality control, especially when dealing with geographically dispersed teams."
HCLTech,1,8-Feb-24,Very bad experience with HCL,System Administrator,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Pune,There is not anything good to say,"I had a very bad experience with the HCL Management team Pune....they hired me as per my experience and aligned with different team at the client location....Also they didn't inform me about the HCL probation policy that we need to serve a 3 month notice period in probation time and when I ask the HCL RM, he is telling me there is no probation period in HCL.

They hire many freshers with non technical skills/degree or BCA degree, who do not have the right vision/attitude towards work and ultimately staling the who IT industry. My RM was having BA degree and that person was managing multiple roles with absolutely no sense, and she was promoted to RM due to other benefits.
2. Management likes favouritism.
3.Very less to learn new things i asked multiple time to my manager to give me more tasks as i was having more bandwidth to do things but it all went in vain."
HCLTech,5,31-Jan-24,Empresa muito inclusiva,Service Desk Analyst,Current Employee,,"Meu projeto é home office e foi a minha primeira experiência com esse regime de trabalho. Ao passo que muitas empresas não aceitam um ""novato"" para o trabalho totalmente remoto, a HCL aceitou e foi/tem sido uma experiência gratificante para mim. Até então foi o melhor ambiente de trabalho em que já estive. Não existe intencionalmente um estabelecimento de cultura da empresa sobre isso (pelo menos não com treinamentos e palestras), Creio que seja muito fruto da equipe da qual faço parte.  Além disso, eles dão vale alimentação, vale refeição e plano médico sem coparticipação.","Sou um analista trilingue, creio que o salario poderia ser mais alto. Outro ponto contra, mas que faz mais parte do meu cargo, é a falta de flexibilidade. Apesar de ser remoto, não posso trabalhar de onde quiser. Posso apenas trabalhar em território brasileiro."

After gaining experience and moving up, this experience from here will support you better.","1. No proper communication from HR & RM
2. No increment, shift allowance or bonus.
3. U will be demanded for 24/7 availability, which is humanly not possible.
4. No nyt shift allowance n depends upon project u joining up.
5. Poor management & attitude towards team mates from leaderships.
6.No holidays in IND calendar or for u. Which means no CH allowance, the least we expect if we work on that day."
HCLTech,2,16-Jan-24,A black dot at the career,Lead Analyst,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Bengaluru,Nothing much apart of salary at the end of the each month,"Its terrible work experience with this organization, they hired us for collection process and never assigned to us. Instead of collection, we begin with some backlog clearance process.
Lack of coordination with employee and manger, no basic facilities at the office premises like lunch or dinner, snakes etc. very poor maintains in washroom and nobody will listen your issues, they will simply ignore if you raised for anything."
HCLTech,1,5-Dec-23,"Bad experience, lots of micromanagement, toxic work environment ",Lead Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Noida,"Nothing at all, they will cut your salary, they install sappien software to track your laptop and will ask you to complete 9 hours in sappien. No hike, only manager enjoy their life","Guys, remember this. Maybe many of you will face a similar situation. My laptop was issued from the Chennai office, and then I moved to Noida. In my notice period, they asked me to work until the last day and submit my laptop on the last day only. When I went to submit my laptop, the IT team told me to either submit it in the Chennai office on my own or send it by courier with my own arrangements. They also mentioned that if something happens to my laptop, they would charge $1200. I tried escalating the issue up to the VP level through email to get help so that I could submit my laptop in Noida, but nobody cared. I ended up sending my laptop by courier, paying Rs. 2500 from my pocket. They didn't inform me about this cost in advance. So submit your laptop at least a week before the last working day. This level of cost-cutting is disappointing. The management and politics at HCLTECH are very poor. I would advise against joining HCLTECH in the future."
HCLTech,1,26-Jan-24,This company is horrible,IT Engineer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Worcester, MA",There are none. People think that they are going to retire from here. That is a joke.

The management is terrible and out to save themselves.,"I have heard that there is an U.S. Federal investigation into the racisim of one of the U.S. teams and their management, a team lead and others. This is indicative of how they operate. These people talk about their executive team who are Indian behind their backs and suck up in their presence to keep a job and resent the indian leaders. This is not a place for advancement, it will derail your career. Good luck, you will need it."

Sometimes it takes months to resolve a simple pay query. Compensation is split over multiple components which you have to constantly fight to be renewed. Senior managers spend a lot of their time simply chasing the bloated broken HR machine instead of focusing on their projects."

Conducive work facilities","Situated in industrial area, lack of food amenities, need to take company shuttle or eat in company cafetaria or a nearby small foodcourt which has limited options. 

Career progress can be slow, depending on the leadership and project management skillset of the leads, many who want to take the credit for themselves instead of looking at recognising the efforts of team members. Can feel left out.

Personally, the role and level of experience i had applied for and the role i got did not match (felt conned by HR), and this was also evident from the compensation (no 13 mth bonus by default, and performance appraisal was not fair). 

Please ensure that the job description in the role match what is assigned, if not its better to consider seeking better roles during the probation period itself."

Many training courses available (though may not always have the budget or time to sign up)","It is quite a shock that the company has been existent as a SI for so many years, but there are no established processes and knowledge management content and hence, standards differ very much among similar projects. Though there are training courses available, but they are not made mandatory to some crucial roles like PMs, where many don't even know what are the basic tools or processes in the company. 
Cost cutting is strictly observed for the sake of doing it and there are no replacement of headcount even there are resignation cases and only when customers start banging tables and escalate to the sky, then the replacement request will be acceded. There is no investment in building the capabilities nor retention of good staff, but yet management will question why projects are not won.
Internal politics struggle among team in meeting their own agenda and revenue targets, and there is no synergy working among teams to leverage on each other's offerings and strength.
There are no KPIs enforced in performance appraisal and top down goals replicated from management to the staff. However, revenue targets given to the team are usually unachievable and unbelievable."

Also, there are plenty of people who somehow manage to find time to sleep at A2 and the rec room, so if you want to kun, you can go there.","Lots of politicking so work performance doesn't matter. Some departments do not set out KPIs at all for the year, so your performance appraisal totally depends on how much your boss likes you. So in spite of working hard for the company, at the end of the day, it's obvious the 'high performers' are the ones who go out with the boss for breakfast, lunch, coffee, smoke break, dinner! 

Also, the English and grammar used in this company is atrocious. When you pick up any brochure at the lobby to read, you have no idea what they're trying to say because it's all a bunch of IT jargon put together and you still don't know what the product is. It's pretty embarrassing especially when you have potential foreign clients.

Please do yourself a favour and try out at an MNC if you want to go into IT. At least they have KPIs and legitimate appraisals."

He informed me during the interview that when I joined the company and deployed to the site, he would provide onsite assistance as BAU (business as usual). At that point, the interviewer left. Because of the lack of manpower for this new project, after working for three to five months, you felt stuck in your position because the job scope was so narrow. It is quite terrible for an interviewer to lie like that. perform in bulk, but there is little diversity The manager and the assistant monitor employee performance. essentially means that when you're not good in a given area, it's not helping you or your team on. and you will only be performing everyday engineering work, which is extremely restricted and has little room for advancement they will do their own job among themself... If you are a fortunate senior like you, however, you will be able to learn beyond the limitations of the engineering function. overall the Manager and Senior engineer is not bad to work together...."

Note:
1) If you're considering joining, Insist on a written guarantee that ensures I am assigned a project from day 1.
2) also same for work from home","1) Lack of Growth and Opportunities for Developers

2) Absence of Development Projects; Existing Projects are on the Verge of Closure

3) Job Insecurity for Bench Employees due to a Severe Lack of Development Projects

4) Company is Predominantly Service-Based; Project Assignments Primarily Involve Support Tasks

5) Poor Management; Uninspiring Work Environment; Discrepancy Between Written Commitments to Work-Life Balance and Actual Practices. Some Leaders Mistreat Employees, Claiming an Unwarranted Authority and Often Taking Credit for the Employees' Work in Front of Higher-ups.

6) Challenges for Freshers in Getting Billable; High Risk of Layoffs After a Year of Bench Period

7) Annual Increment Ranges from 0 to 7% at Maximum; No Annual Bonus, Despite Inclusion in CTC

8) Contributions Beyond Project Work Not Considered in Annual and Quarterly Reviews

9) Strict 8-Hour Workday; While There's No Screen Monitoring, Entry and Exit Times are Recorded for Office-based Work.

10) Skills-Based Hiring Does Not Necessarily Align with Project Assignments"

The ARQ business caused divide and even more divide with NCS not knowing what they want and just wasting time on meaningless processes that go no where.

The market opportunities are really solid compared to many other startups. Senior leadership is (in my opinion) really pro-active and competent in growing the business.

There's quite a bit of mess though, but mess represents opportunities to have a big impact, so long as you can come to terms with that. The corollary is that you reasonably can expect to have better (i.e. easier) opportunities to have a larger impact than some of the more mature tech companies in Seattle.

Founders are truly passionate, and do take concrete action in trying to create a good culture.","Grab has been suffering from relatively high turnover and attrition. While building an enduring engineering organization is one of the OKRs, but I've seen very little attention given by upper management and concrete plans communicated on what steps the organization is taking towards this. All the oxygen is spent on outcompeting in our strategic markets, growing the business, or keeping our service up. 

So... amongst other things, forget about any sort of training on things like ethics and compliance, diversity and inclusion. It results in situations such as there being (large) teams in Seattle which suffer from extreme homogeneity in race/country-of-origin... and where if you're not a member of this race, you're part of the out-group... 

... and unfortunately, being part of the out-group has very real repercussions beyond the social aspects..."

The dedication to a commendable cause is a driving force that fosters a sense of collective commitment.","Leadership Immaturity: Grab has witnessed immature leadership, marked by knee-jerk reactions over the past two years, leading to an uncertain work environment and abrupt changes that impact overall stability.
Diversity and Inclusion Concerns: Non-local or non-Chinese employees may experience racism in day-to-day conversations. Additionally, data on hiring and promotions raises concerns about an unfair skew towards Chinese ethnicity, necessitating urgent attention to foster a more inclusive workplace.
Bullying Complaints Ignored: Formal and informal complaints about bullying, supported by evidence, appear to be consistently ignored. This lapse in addressing employee well-being contributes to a less-than-ideal workplace culture. Particularly alarming is the prevalence of bullying among senior leaders, indicating a systemic issue that demands immediate intervention. Concerns raised via whistleblowing channels seem to be disregarded, exacerbating the problem.
Strategic Deficiency: The company tends to be more tactical than strategic, emphasizing immediate actions over long-term planning. This impacts Grab's overall effectiveness and requires a reevaluation of the strategic approach.
Cost Management Priorities: Grab's approach to cost management raises questions, with decisions seeming less thoughtful regarding retaining valuable leaders and choosing advisors. There's a notable tendency to make sweeping changes while simultaneously investing substantial sums in campaigns, leading to concerns about resource allocation.
Flawed ""Grab Life"" HR Vision: ""The Grab Life,"" a HR vision document, is perceived as ineffective, reflecting a misguided focus on the wrong aspects of employee experience. This highlights another instance of leadership immaturity, as the emphasis on such initiatives might be diverting attention from more critical factors for driving success."

If you have P&L responsibility, you will be asked and expected to do unnatural things with forecasts and financials in order to drive the stock price. This company is not looking out for the best interest of their retail partners, end customers, and certainly not their mid-level employees. It's a serious shame given that it used to be an excellent place to work and one that valued morals and doing what is right. Advancement is limited unless someone quits, retires, or dies. You will be strung along with the promise of moving up when in reality they expect you to take on more work and more responsibility, including training and mentoring, while taking pay cuts. Additionally, their benefits are disproportionately expensive for such a large company and the pay is not competitive to other tech."

I am given a lot of freedom in what I work on. People are generally nice. They encourage career cross training across orgs. They do have business networks which throw events which encourages people to talk to others they may not normally get the chance to. Unlimited time off (depends on the management though.) I think if you’re trying to gain experience and show career growth for your next company it’s a solid place to work.,Pay is middle of the road. The priorities are all over the place. There is a new organization every day. So many teams it’s hard to track down how to fix something. A lot of “well this isn’t my job” and lack of ownership. Conflicting business objectives across the board. Employees are used to development tickets taking 6-7 months to be completed. New product focus with low resources for products in the field. So many people that have been here 20+ years. It’s hard to push for modernization when some people are stuck in the “this is how it’s been” mentality. Lack of industry best practices knowledge shows in business objectives and software.

Leadership from Senior Director down is very good.,"You can’t trust HR, they are here to protect the company, not the employees. Senior management is the worst I’ve ever experienced, and it keeps getting worse. They tell the employees what they want them to hear and then do something completely different. Managers are only allowed to promote 10% of their team each year. So a team of 10, only 1 promotion this year. Hey new intern, it’s going to be 10 years before you get a promotion. Quotas on annual reviews. Only 10% can exceed expectations, 80% will meet and you must have 10% that fail to meet expectations. Why can’t we just be honest and rate people the way they deserve."

Hybrid WFH could be worse (some people like it, some people don't, so it's probably a good balance - they just need to clear a few things up)","Cybersecurity leadership is horrible. They are more interested in making the person above them look good so they can get promoted at the cost of security and doing the right thing to protect customer data. I had a Director take an idea I worked on and present it as theirs alone, which is not a way to inspire more ideas. 

I also have multiple directors I need to report to because there is an outdated idea that you need someone local to report to.

I've even heard one leader yell and swear in a conference call with their leaders (not sure exactly about what, but I have my suspicions it was a around a self identified gap that would make their boss look bad).

And return to office metrics make no sense. They have some weird math to calculate how much in office is 50%. I've had more than one colleague get burned by it not being clear. To be clear, they were not let go, just a nice stern talking to (their words)."

2.) ""Nice"" people and leadership

3.) Autonomy (at least, in my role)

4.) Interesting problems to solve","1.) Dishonest leadership, dishonest ER / HR

2.) SECURITY HOLE! My former immediate supervisor uses a non-corporate WhatsApp account, for communication between international offices / engineering teams, instead of the communications / conferencing tools Visa licenses and provides. I'm fairly certain there is neither corporate oversight, nor even permissions provided, to do so.

3.) A spaghetti nightmare of websites / webapps and navigation, for everything from access requests, internal tooling, software, service requests, to employee benefits. Absolutely the most expansive and least-well organzed of anywhere I've worked, over my nearly 20-year career. 

4.) (Minor) fewer extras / amenities than what other tech orgs offer.

The start of my short tenure at Visa was good, but ended horribly, in a way endemic to the tech industry's false narrative of diversity, inclusivity, empathy, and transparency. 

Unfortunately, my time with Visa was interrupted by a prison gang who targeted me, and my home, for harassment, stalking, and, at one point, attempted abduction, for nearly four weeks. This occurred day and night (and I have both still and video evidence, as well as police reports). This also, of course, impacted my productivity, as my safety and well-being were being threatened, and I safeguarded myself. 

Unfortunately, also, it brought out some ugly true colors, methinks, of Visa, as an employer and as a culture - at least in technology.

During this time of harassment, Visa Employee Relations (ER / HR) placed me on administrative leave and subjected me to two psychiatric evaluations, which Visa ER leadership stated were being conducted so Visa could best support my situation, esp. given I have both pre-existing high-functioning autism and PTSD.

Visa Employee Relations Leadership lied the entire way. It was made clear, by both psychiatrists, that the intent was, actually, to determine my suitability for continued employment. Empathy and transparency fail. Honesty fail. 

Ultimately, there was no feedback provided, nor result declared, regarding these psych evals, nor were they used as reasoning toward my termination. Not surprising, considering what was happening to me WAS REALLY HAPPENING.

I have requested the documented results of my exams, from the psychiatrists, only to be ignored. Likely, this is tangential to why such results weren't considered in my termination. Likely, there was nothing there to suggest I was unsuitable. This falls under HIPAA, so, denying me access to my records is illegal. 

While my severance payout was OK, their initial severance contract was, essentially, a ""hush"" contract, which would have nullified my rights to speak or write of any of what is here, the contents of the contract, or, even, the contract itself. This would also apply to my family, as the initial language also bound them.

However, the Nation Labor Relations Board had already set a legal precedent, by declaring, via court ruling, in Feb 2023, that EMPLOYERS CANNOT FORCE EMPLOYEES TO SIGN AWAY THEIR RIGHTS FOR A SEVERANCE PAYOUT. 

That last bit is in all caps, as other employees should probably make note. Per the above, Visa was forced to heavily modify the contract, being forced to remove large portions of its text, and reword others. Otherwise, I wouldn't be legally permitted to write this review!"

Visa Inc.,2,45230,Culture heavily depends on team,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,Overall good culture and above average benefits company wise.,"At accounting, C-level leadership's vision is very hard to get grounded from middle level management down, such as ""everyone can be a leader"". Managers and certain employees have been at the company for years, and it is very difficult to make changes due to top-down directive type culture from leadership. The opinions were not valued or supported and people managers' skills are extremely lacking in many teams and they simply do whatever upper management asked them to do. Especially in my org, it's a very restrictive, political culture, micromanaging culture, with no diversity at all but all asian managers and employees. There has been a while when several leadership kept repeating ""doing the right things"", ""open door policy"" ""no politics here"" as there might has be some legal issues arising, but they didn't really mean it as they are very political and not being honest. They don't really accept ""challenging the status quo"" and manage up. I have seen many people don't have psychological safety to voice up and worry about backfire among different teams, people have different opinions with the leadership and eventually had to leave due to repercussion, from junior level to VP level, and I've also heard other people moved from finance to accounting and got burned out. Burnout is rampant as teams are under resourced and not supported by management. Higher level employees can bully lower level employees like throw tantrum on them when they are stressed. Managers didn't really want to help employees succeed and develop their careers but want them just keep working. Nepotism and favoritism is very popular in my team if you can be an upper management people pleaser. Career development can be very hard as managers don't know how to hire the right people, and they hire unqualified people and let the whole team suffer. Managers won't do much to low performance employees as long as they are managers' pleaser. It's also hilarious that they keep enforcing RTO but a lot of high level finance leadership and even HR are telecommuter who are located from nowhere and never go to the office. They don't embrace diversity and inclusion. You can survive if you know how to playing games or a working machine."

The health insurance plan is particularly noteworthy, as it covers 100% for employees. While there may be some cost-sharing for family coverage, the company still contributes significantly towards it. Additionally, the 401k matching program is a valuable perk, helping employees save for retirement. These benefits demonstrate the company's commitment to supporting the financial well-being and security of its employees.","As a full-time employee, it's important to maintain a healthy work-life balance. However, in this company, the workload can be overwhelming, even in a hybrid work setup that was intended to provide flexibility. It seems that the wellness hours, particularly on Fridays, are not respected, and there is a possibility of being asked to work on evenings and weekends.

Bloomberg,3,45167,Used to be better,Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","London, England",#NAME?,"- since they drank the scrum koolaid, micromanagement has worsened and it’s night on impossible to be entrepreneurial or innovative except for very limited and managed one day a fortnight “10% time” - pointless return to office is being enforced with no exceptions or consideration for train strikes, childcare needs, etc. despite the last 3 years having proven the teams can work just as effectively (if not more in many cases) remotely. - return to office is slowly creeping up from 3 days to 4 every week. - no justification or explanation given for RTO, it’s just “policy” - hypocrisy of big internal marketing signs and slogans up marketing “Bring your kids to work day by Bloomberg Working Families Community” while at the same time being told the small work from home allowance left is explicitly not to be used for childcare emergencies or needs, and talk of “the days of seeing kids in the background of zoom calls” being over (I mean how petty can you get - we want to pretend our workers are automatons who aren’t humans with lives outside work, so we can’t even see traces of any humanity or children- you must appear a corporate drone at all times). - Disastrous loss of morale with the RTO attitude and hypocrisy."
Bloomberg,3,45303,Mostly a good place to work if you are in the right team...,Sales,Current Employee,"London, England","Very good benefits, amazing office, travel for business in absolute comfort, very good pay and increases, global mobility, absolute job security, access to cultural events, plenty opportunities to move within the firm to other areas.","Micro-management, No WFH flexibility (1 day allowed, soon to be removed altogether) and they would have you in the office 24/7/365 if they were allowed. Long working hours 8-6. Different rules across teams and leniency towards female staff, males have to beg for, and not get, the same privileges female staff receive without question. Poor management and leadership from team leaders who have zero power (everything driven from management many levels above) or know-how to make decisions or manage a team - they are mostly yes men. Enterprise products usually inferior and a lot more expensive than competitors, with zero room for negotiations which puts strain on business relations."
Bloomberg,3,45160,Draconian approach to remote work,Editor,Current Employee,"London, England","- Decent pay, especially when you first start - Some level of job stability compared to other media owners - Lots of perks (free snacks and things - not the kind that constitute company culture)","- The big one is the return to the office. Bloomberg is making all employees come in for 4 days a week. Never mind that many of us are more productive when working from home, never mind that the office is so big it takes 10 minutes just to get a coffee and another 10 to go to the bathroom, never mind that the office has so few meeting rooms it's impossible to get a private space for client calls and meetings, never mind that employees are happier and healthier when they don't have to get up at the crack of dawn to commute into an office, never mind that neurodivergent colleagues struggle to concentrate with the noise and lights of the office environment, never mind that there's a cost of living crisis and it costs thousands extra per year to travel in and out, never mind that the planet's on fire and commuting causes more emissions even though Bloomberg supposedly cares so much about climate change. They just want us in the office! And the worst thing is, they won't even be honest about why. As a consequence, a lot of us are looking for other jobs - which I suspect is the goal. - It's also a very flat structure so there isn't much chance of progression - A lot of middle management have been hanging around for 5, 10, 15 or even 20 years. They do nothing and leave the work to everyone else, whilst openly hoping for a redundancy payout."
Bloomberg,2,45323,Avoid if you can,Analytics and Sales,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",,#NAME?,"- Long hours and glorified version of customer support

Depending on the team, you need to code in fortran and work on solaris/aix machines that vscode does not even support. - Lots of internal tech which are not pleasant to use. Almost nothing related to the Bloomberg terminal is mordern. - Development workflow is extremely lagging for lots of teams. No CI/CD, no linting, no formatter, no docker. Your service will run on a barebone vm instance. Be ready to spend lots of time on figuring out how to build and ship your code. - Most teams adopt the scrum methodology so expect daily standups. Some teams have standups like 2-3 times a week. - Opaque performance evaluation and salary bump. People say there is a magic formula to determine your salary increase. - You badge in/out time show up on your profile and after your email address."

Bloomberg,2,45316,"Pay Is Decent, But Don't Expect To Learn Anything Valuable",Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","New York, NY",#NAME?,"- Coworkers are pretty mediocre and do not care about quality.
- The brightest people who actually care tend to be new-grads who don't know how bad things are because it's their first job.
- Things are done in the most backwards way possible, no real technical leadership (imagine layer upon layer upon layer of tech debt spanning decades) .
- There is an insane amount of process to do the most simple of things, like pushing a Docker image to a repository requires submitted numerous tickets, privileging oneself, etc, likely a day or two of process just to run a single command.
- Bloombergers seem to pride themselves on doing things the backwards way, with onboarding material conditioning new-hires to expect doing things the backwards way (""Don't bring up how your past company did it, we do things differently at Bloomberg!"" ... so you don't care how other companies do this because ... why?)
- Do no expect to use common industry-wide practices, tech, etc. You will use old, outdated tech, libraries, practices.
- As a result, you will learn Bloomberg-only skills and you won't be as hireable at other companies.
- They dogfood the Bloomberg Terminal everywhere; instead of using normal software like Slack, a normal email client, etc., you have to use 1980s technology (the Bloomberg terminal), which runs in a Windows VM and crashes (literally) 4+ times a day.
- Minimum of 2 years before you can change teams. I was hired for one thing and they put me into a different role I have 0 interest in doing which is detrimental to my career.
- They're oddly cheap about a lot of things; no free lunch, the snacks they do provide are simple things like Doritos.
- Laptops are old and worn out with a long process to get something not 3+ years old.
- The company is so big that decisions are made from non-stakeholders on the other side of the company who have no clue what is going on."

Buracratic non-sense is real (even if they try to argue it's not). Office is new and modern, but kinda lifeless. 90% of the time, no food. When there is food, it was a bowl of soup, and ppl line up 100 ft waiting 5 minutes, feels very depressing. The ""values"" just feel like a bunch of fluff to make everyone feel good and feel like theyre doing a good thing. The Bloomberg Philanthropy is a lot about the PR. It all kinda feels dystopian. There's not enough room for everyone to get ahead (naturally, not their fault). To get ahead, you'd need to spend years (even if they say you dont need to) just bc there are no positions available. And... there will be others just as good as you who are qualified. The terminal is old and annoying. It's cool at first, but it gets old real fast. You never actually learn how to use the terminal like a finance guy. There's no real training/on-boarding to teach you the Bloomberg ecosystem (which is important)."

Don't trust HR or any Diversity Advocate / outside agencies / charities. Especially if they say its anonymous. They are all there to protect the company in case of litigation / media attention. 
Get a lawyer/solicitor instead.

All comes from the founder, Micheal Bloomberg.
No surprise he came up with stop-and-frisk, which was then copied by the UK with stop-and-search."

Bloomberg,4,45277,Mixed feeling about the company but can’t complain as it could be so much worse for my skill sets,Sales,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","London, England","- higher salary relative to the industry, see cons for reasons. 

- even if you don’t meet the quotas, if you have good reasons, they will take those into consideration (your customer going out of business for example). 

- envious office. 

- relatively easy work. 

- middle of the pack get the most benefits.

- your interpersonal, tertiary, non transferable skills are tested at great length.

- rarely fire people unless you are consistently at the bottom.

- freedom to make your own calendar.

- founder owned, everyone else just employee.

- there is brand value that originates from the 80s and muscle power. 

- your salary increases with the number of years you are with the company.

- abilities to run your own campaigns and ignore to a great extent campaigns imposed by management because they don’t apply or work in your region/customer types.","- long hours (contracted hours are at least 25% more than industry average) with no flexibility. If you adjusted the hours, the pay would be on par with competitors. 

- if you are a high performer, they will find something you didn’t do well and punish you (same doesn’t apply to those in the middle of the pack)

- no innovation or new products (this is the biggest turn off for me). Terminal is our greatest strength and at the same time greatest constraints hence weakness. 

- meeting for the sake of meeting

- always need to manage managers not customers (great showmanship required)

- when they do fire, absolutely no mercy, they will fire by the minimum legally required standards which translate into at best couple of weeks of your salary (even if you worked there for 10+ years or longer, even if you are a manager). 

- never have enough time for you to explore other career paths in your spare time.

- after 10 years, you might end up with not much tangible skills if at all.

- a lot of vanity projects like deliberate D&I or industry events."

Culture and people is good.","The company preaches that you are paid according to the market but in reality only your salary curve may be similar to the market. Your actual base salary is usually 30% below market. Salary increases and performance bonuses are poor regardless of how well you perform or even how well the company performs. Promotions? If you really like what you do and are trying to get a promotion within the same role, forget about it. Not going to happen. Only way to land a promotion is moving internally to a different role but then, HR is able to see your current salary and will cap your salary increase to keep you really low within your new salary curve. Last but not least, every 12-18month the company goes through re-orgs that usually focus on cost saving and translates to work force reductions."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise | HPE,3,45286,"Good company if your college age or connected, not 30+","Director, Business Development","Former Employee, more than 10 years","Tampa, FL","Perks, culture, etc. is some of the best in the industry","Every 12-18 months, the company undergoes a ""reorganization"" aimed at redirecting priorities and reducing costs. While skills and performance are cited, these reorgs disproportionately target higher-paid, veteran employees. The real intent is to cut costs not really care about their veteran employees.

I was with the company for 25 years before being released due to a recent reorg. My department lost funding and could not maintain my salary - one of the highest due to my tenure. No other departments could take on my compensation either.

This pattern indicates a strategy of replacing experienced, skilled employees with entry-level hires purely to cut costs. While legal, it systematically pushes out veteran expertise. Employees should be aware that loyalty and performance may not protect against being cut solely due to higher salaries.

The company could be more transparent about the financial motivations behind these reorgs. And it risks losing critical institutional knowledge and skills. While some cost-cutting may be necessary, there are likely better ways to achieve savings while valuing and retaining essential experience."

- Supervisor always had confidence in students and encouraged them to contribute their own ideas
- Good pay
- Good opportunity to gain experience with new technologies (Oracle database, Jira, Red Hat OpenShift, ...)
- Good canteen food","- Many (mostly unnecessary for my area of responsibility) compliance trainings (partially introduced as a response to Dieselgate)
- No home office (at least before Corona) for interns & working students
- Old office
- Company computers run only Windows (i.e., no Macs) with very restrictive configuration (installation of Google Chrome, for example, was only possible with my supervisor's approval)
- Internal hosting of web applications is outsourced to employees in India who were overwhelmed by many technical problems
- Partly unmotivated colleagues (early retirement, partial retirement & severance payments were frequent discussion topics among the german workforce)
- Not the best prospects (Feuerbach site) due to the transition to e-mobility"
Robert Bosch,2,45321,Industry average,Software Engineer,Former Employee,Ho Chi Minh City,"Bosch shows a great example of what a multinational organization is, and how multi-level management is arranged. 
Working at Bosch provides opportunities to work with expats.
Since Bosch is an average performer, working here shows a glimpse into the software industry -> a good career starter for most.
Salary is average.
Functional equipment.
Mixed background workforce.
Bosch's contracts in Vietnam are mostly mediocre (standard), but I luckily landed a great one, so all great.","Most frameworks used are either internal - which means knowledge is non-transferable - or extremely dated which also means the same thing.
Most Boschers are literally code monkeys with really high specialism but relatively weak in term of managerial prowess.
Poor English overall, in all divisions.
Offices are really muted and unmotivating.
Career opportunities is sufficient.
Continuous propagandas about Bosch displayed and mentioned by low-tier managers."

Very bad salary expectations and annual raises are half of the inflation.

Robert Bosch,1,45217,Don't join JMP!,Junior Managers Program (JMP),"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Budapest,"The new office in Budapest is nice, but it lacks a personal touch. Too big, feels like a modern way of keeping slaves.","You go through 6 rounds of interviews, including a personality test, which takes a long time. HR promises you everything, and reality settles in shortly after you join. They lie about the contract, fail to mention important details and deny to address them once you sign. The whole concept of JMP in Hungary is flawed. HR hires for positions where receiving departments have no headcount but would like some. It's a mentor roulette - HR sells the whole program as a great opportunity, with you taking the lead on setting up your stage plan (4x6 months rotation plan) with the help of your mentor - only for this to turn out to be false. My rotation plan was already set in stone, and my so-called ""mentor"" was not interested in my needs or opinion, only their own. If you get a mentor who sucks, you're stuck with them for 4 years. They will try to intimidate and blackmail you into staying, and if you decide to speak up honestly, they will fire you - just like it happened to me. Currently, about 80% of JMPs leave Bosch after the program ends. Senior management does not care about JMP as they are too occupied with investigating whether employees pay for all items at the restaurant. If you're okay with being a corporate lapdog and keeping your mouth shut, feel free to choose Bosch Hungary."

TikTok,1,45280,Don't work here,Cash Management Specialist,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Los Angeles, CA","Free food, snacks, and gym","Right from the beginning, the job I was hired for never indicated in their job requirements that Mandarin was needed. On my first day, I come to learn that all training documents are in Mandarin, all the group chats for my team are in Mandarin, and the system that I am working on 90% of the time is completely in Mandarin. There was also little to no onboarding, so I had to hit the ground running with what little Mandarin I knew. 


Being only 1 of 2 people in North America in my team (the rest are in China), it meant that any help or questions I had could only be routed to this team member, who was extremely unhelpful and hostile. It almost felt like I was a threat or burden to her, so all questions about how to do certain things were met with questions back (ie. ""Does this make sense?"" or ""What do you think?"").

After bringing concerns of this to my director, I was gaslit and told that the job did ask for someone with proficiency in Mandarin. I threw the copy of the job description (nowhere did it indicate Mandarin was required) in their face and called it quits from there.

tl;dr - Don't work here. Extremely toxic environment that revolves about the people in China (who are the ones who make decisions), a lot of gaslighting, and the working culture is horrendous."
TikTok,1,45328,Covert Racism,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Austin, TX",Pay and benefits are in alignment with most tech roles.,"If you are not a white male you will not be allowed to promote within TikTok. Most, if not all senior leadership have no experience working with other black leaders thus creating consistent bias in their perceptions and reviews of black talent. Look at TikTok's structure and question why the white employees are promoted to higher levels of leadership within 1-2 years while black leaders and employees are off boarded within the same time frame consistently. Hiring other minorities within the company is not a way to ignore the underrepresentation of African American leaders. Most of the decisions do in fact roll down from China with the disguise of other leaders making the decisions. These leaders are not based in the US either. Promotions are for those who talk a lot with no proof of impact."
TikTok,1,45243,Chinese bureaucracy - low pay and morale,Client Solutions Manager,Current Employee,,- You get a stable paycheck - Snacks are decent when they're available - People seem nice on the surface for small talk,"- Top down leadership that enforces whatever comes down from leadership in China. No surprise there but don't expect to have a voice in the company - No career growth opportunities unless you want to play politics by constantly shouting out people and ""proving value"" by going way above and beyond your job. Good luck with that given the workload everyone faces. - Rapidly growing yet internal processes and headcount is insufficient. Expect long hours at sub-par pay given the stress and constantly moving goalposts - Forced RTO has been increasing across the industry, but Tiktok is quickly going from 3 to 4 by next year, and it's only a matter of time until 5. Tracked by badge swipes showcases no trust because at the end of the day, leadership just wants people in seats. - Silent layoffs. People have been cut in small groups with no mentions by leadership or team meetings. Overall, I would truly not recommend working here unless you have no other alternatives. Constant change mixed by people working in silos, beholden to any sudden changes by leadership, and morale continues to tank. We have some smart people here but it's quickly becoming evident that this is a sinking ship, and that's not even factoring in the political landscape."
TikTok,1,45327,Worst company I've ever worked for,"Manager, Global E-Commerce & Partnership Marketing","Current Employee, more than 3 years","Los Angeles, CA","Other than the fact that it's a shiny object and people are impressed you work there, there are zero pros.","The worst leadership I've ever worked with in my career of 15 years. Constant re-orgs on a monthly basis, randomly shifting who reports to who based on who speaks Mandarin and who is in the pocket of leadership. Treats other companies horribly and bullies them to always get what TikTok wants. Entire focus is on pushing Shops, which is not working and advertisers don't want to use because they do not trust the company (as they shouldn't). They bait and switch every program to get advertisers to trust the platform but the long term vision is to become Douyen and Star Maps and cut out any competition in the market."
TikTok,1,45282,Worst Company with hostile work environment,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,Maybe free lunch and dinner,"Worked for over a year and the team I worked for, backstabbed me and I lost my job because of the evil team and immature and evil management and the corrupted HR. The manager was the worst and most unprofessional manager I have ever worked for. This is not a made-up story, the environment is extremely toxic, controlled by CN based people and too much politics and backstabbing. They expect you to work 12+ hours like a slave. There is absolutely no empathy, sympathy for the employees especially if you have family / kids. 
If the company feels like you will open the facts to the public or complain (saying the truth), they will throw you in a S..hole. They make your life so miserable that you have no other choice but to quit. They use the performance review technique to give you a poor performance score that puts you on a one-month probation which you either need to resign or they will fire you anyways. 

Don't fall for the name and fancy stuff you hear, this is not a place you want to work, you will regret your life."

Firstly, the concept of work/life balance seems non-existent. Meetings commence at 7:00 pm and often extend until 10:00 pm due to the involvement of many colleagues based in China.

The organizational mentality deviates significantly from what one might encounter in a Western workplace. Recognition for excellent work is not a norm; it's considered a part of your responsibilities. However, any inability to complete the numerous day-to-day tasks is met with blame rather than constructive feedback.

An additional critical success factor here is proficiency in Chinese/Mandarin. This requirement goes beyond language barriers; it extends to the importance of networking within the company."

The company is growing so quickly and it is very rewarding to lead Fortune 100 companies to be creative participants in the TikTok conveersation,"- Sales leadership is rarely seen of heard from, unless its to tell us to be in the office 4x/week
- Sales goals are extraordinarily high and unachievable. Many top sales reps and teams strive for hitting 70% of goal. There is no transparency from leadership to justify these goals. 
- It takes more than 2 years on avg to get a level-change or promotion"
TikTok,2,45212,Sad to say this but in my experience there is a consistent & underlying pattern of gaslighting,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"- THE PEOPLE. People who work there are genuinely so talented and nice. That's why I and, I think most people stay(ed). - Its awesome when having a @tiktok.com email opens any doors or inbox to you - Its an awesome brand and the product is exceptional - Great events, very unreliable but cool swag - Many of the leaders are genuinely awesome","- There is a pattern of consistent and underlying gaslighting at TikTok that I have witnessed over my many years working there. I think this is largely driven by poor HR practices. You see this cascade through levels of management where leaders and individual HR members are complicit in continuing it down to their directs & stakeholders in order to do a good job at their roles and keep discontent from employees at a minimum.Examples of this: convincing employees that they are wrong when they come with comp concerns, setting unachievable goals or moving the goal posts, changing policies that they'd previously indicated, over-relying on top performers to carry teams but not rewarding them, giving individuals management roles but stripping their autonomy to make decisions at it applies to their business, leaders who aren't really making decisions but are having decisions dictated to them - Culture of individual self promotion externally - Comp & benefits is truly subpar, the current stock buy back program is evidence of this. ByteDance already devalued RSUs for employees last year to ""make the company more attractive to future hires"" and has further devalued stocks by offering a different buyback price for former employees than current. Their value just keeps getting lower and lower. I genuinely think many people hold on because they keep hoping it'll pay off rather than just cutting bait on something that's actually becoming less valuable over time - The ""360"" performance review isn't real and it takes most people about 3 review rounds to see that. Your success is determined by your manager, their sway, their results, whether or not they like you, and the overall forced distribution - Performance review is used as a chance to change the levels of employees who have been ""promoted"" in the middle of the period, rather than actually reward high performance - No merit increases. Your performance ""raises"" or any raise from a role change (unlikely to happen) slowly get eaten up by inflation. It's very difficult to tangibly increase your comp - Pockets of bad bad lack of work life balance"

The company culture and ideals are generally more evolved, diverse, and more relaxed than the usual kind of corporate set up which I'm thankful for particularly given the nature of the work, even if the company does at times too much hark on this sort of fake cool corporate family vibe. Still, the people I work with are nice and there is some attention paid to mental health (although often inadequate).","The nature of the work is often tedious even if it's rarely boring and watching hateful and violent videos on an hourly constant is not great for anyone’s mental health and the company (like most big corporations) are a little flippant in regard to that toll on employees but attempt to put up a good front with what are ultimately mediocre benefits and incentives.

TikTok,1,45259,STAY AWAY FROM this toxic place,Strategy Manager,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","San Francisco, CA","pays well, but you are over worked. So it doesn't really pay that well.","The most toxic place I've ever been. Here's my experience as one data point. 
1. Manager A, whom I've been working together with for more than half a year. Every one-on-one session is basically me providing additional tutoring to him. There's no planning or contribution to my work from him, not even a sense of direction. He doesn't offer any input, leaving me to conceptualize the scope for each bimonthly project on my own. He neither supports nor opposes any proposals I put forward. If I succeed, he takes credit; if I fail, it's on me. Throughout this period, he hasn't contributed anything. He doesn't assess my work independently but relies on the opinions of people from a parallel department. Resources are always said to be ""in the process of negotiation,"" but in reality, they are not provided. I've interviewed dozens of candidates, and some promising ones get stuck when they reach him. I don't understand why, if we're not hiring, why wasting so much time of mine, the recruiter's, and the candidates'. I have no idea what he's busy with; he has never produced any results himself. When asked, he claims other areas need him to put out fires.

2. Clearly lacking top-down direction, Manager A says I ""lack entrepreneurship."" At this point, my mind is clear, and I find it amusing. I manage four or five projects simultaneously, discovering opportunities, designing, and executing them on my own. Yet, he says I lack entrepreneurship.

3. For the past half-year, I've been working overloaded, 14-16 hours a day. Being in the U.S. West Coast, I need to collaborate with teams in China, attending meetings at 5:30 am, 6:30 am, and often extending meetings until at least 10 pm during weekdays. Meetings frequently go into the early hours of the morning, and I still have to do my own work afterward.

4. After more than half a year, Manager A brings in Manager B. This person has no relevant experience whatsoever, not even remotely related.

5. I end up tutoring B for almost a month, explaining the situation to them. I don't want to dwell on why this person became my boss; I'm just relieved to have someone to share the workload.

6. A month later, I ask B about her plans for my work as my boss. B says, ""Just go with the flow, take it easy."" Then, she turn around and tell Manager A that I'm not in good shape, not actively working.

7. B assigns me to lead a project, let's call it Project Z. Anyone with experience would know this project is impossible to complete. During the planning phase, I point out that both internal and external conditions for this project are not mature, suggesting we wait until they are more favorable. B insists on proceeding. Since B doesn't listen to advice, I reluctantly follow her instructions, and the results are naturally not satisfactory. Later, two different people took over Project Z, one resigns after a few weeks, and the other transferred to a different team. (It's clear that the insistence on doing project Z was A and B's problem.) Eventually, Project Z becomes the sole basis for B to claim that my ""judgment is lacking.""

8. B openly wants me to leave. The reason is, ""My team cannot have two senior people,"" and the next day she said, ""My team can have two senior people, but you are not suitable."" However, due to visa issues, I can't resign immediately. So, I'm witness some more horror.

9. My relationship with the counterpart team has always been good. This is why, even when it was tough, I persisted in this position before B arrived. One day, B requests that I stop having one-on-one meetings with people from the counterpart team. She told me ""Don't attend these meetings"" (but those were meetings organized by me), and ""Don't have one-on-ones with XX.""

10. After another month, Both managers, along with HR, tell me that my performance is poor. The main accusations are ""lack of judgment"" and ""trust with the collaborating team cannot be repaired."" At this point, because I haven't had direct contact with the collaborating team for over a month, I start doubting myself. After talking to several people from the collaborating team, I realize that this is completely baseless nonsense.

11. B says I have a ""perfectionist tendency and am not suitable for this environment."" Unable to come up with anything substantial, they repeatedly criticize my personality, making vague and ambiguous remarks. When I ask for specific work-related examples, they accuse me of being defensive (attacking my attitude, attacking my personality, refusing to discuss work)."

No member of management really seemed to care for your well-being. Penalized for having hospital emergency and had HR meeting to find ways to deal with my poor attendance even though it was 2 sick days and one hospital visit. Many people quit without notice because of poor treatment from HR. My direct manager was a good man. Everyone else in the chain was very rude at every interaction. Was given 2x original work duties as reward for my good work. No extra compensation associated with it and nothing to show for it. They have a reward system in place but it was strongly biased to client facing employees. So many of the harder working employees never saw any rewards for their work. While one single employee would receive rewards multiple times each week.
DXC Technology,1,45281,Bad Managment ,JEE Web & Middleware,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Sofia, Sofia (city)",No Pros from the management during the most economy hard times in the world.,"I would like to share my feedback regarding my tenure at DXC Technology, where I worked for nearly three years across four different projects simultaneously.

During my time at DXC, there were numerous instances where concerns were raised during meetings, particularly by Peter Mrazik, regarding the unavailability of bonuses and the removal of the merit process. These discussions were often delivered in a less-than-ideal tone, which, in my view, contributed to a less positive work environment.

In addition, despite my commitment to putting in many hours of overtime, my recognition was limited to occasional expressions of appreciation, and after nearly three years of dedicated service, I received a modest 10 percent salary increase. This was not reflective of the significant effort I put into my work and the multiple projects I managed concurrently.

Furthermore, there seemed to be a disconnect between the information shared in direct manager meetings, which consistently conveyed a positive outlook for the company, and the financial statements released every quarter, which indicated a less optimistic reality. This disparity raised concerns about transparency and communication within the organization.

One of the public discussions that raised eyebrows was the decision by Peter Mrazik to halt promotions, allegedly due to personal preferences against promotions in Bulgaria. Meanwhile, it was disheartening to learn that our direct managers were reportedly receiving bonuses based on the money saved by the company, which appeared to be incongruent with the challenges faced by the employees."

The direct supervisors were not only helpful when learning new things, they are also have a wealth of knowledge.
The pay was decent.","The upper management doesn't care at all about the employees.
Upper management will often force decisions down that you know are bad for the system. Even if you voice your concerns, they don't care.
They've had to duct tape the system together so much that nothing is consistent. This is because of TPF changing over the years, but also because of upper managements lack of foresight.
The hours are horrible. A rotating 7 day schedule isn't easy to do.
TPF is going out of the IT world pretty soon. So learning anything about it won't benefit you very much outside of a very niche market.
There's no opportunities to move up in the company because upper management won't hire new employees.
They recently announced that they were having ""financial issues"". Due to this, management has forced down cost cutting measures and put off hiring much needed help for the desk."

DXC Technology,2,45300,Decadent Company,Senior Manager,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,"- There are a lot of internal training options.
- Might be an option for young people with no experience. However, I don't recommend this company if you can find something else.
- Work from home is, at least for my area, the norm now. This is the only real high point, and probably the only reason employees are not mass resigning.","- No increases. Do not expect any salary increases. Since the merge there have been only a few select regions and groups receiving an increase. However, I only know this via rumors, since I myself haven't spoken with anyone that has received anything for the whole history of the company (since the merge that created the company on 2017), I haven't received or seen anyone receive any merit increase. This is despite being consistently graded on my performance reviews with good results, including the last 3 years being among the top performers. The last time this was discussed on a town hall the CEO got mad, because of people questioning and confronting him about the topic, and was the last we heard of him for literally years, until he was replaced, a few weeks ago.
- You might lose your job at any moment. Unfortunately, the only consistent strategy this company has to make the bottom line and appease shareholders is cost reduction via layoffs. This is done without regard of your performance and most of the time whether or not your job is needed or not, regardless of any impact for your client.
- It seems this company exists only to make their top executives richer: Look up a Register article, ""Despite declines, DXC Technology boss awarded $20.3m in 2023"", cannot paste the link here due to GD policies."

Excessively high insurance plans with low coverage even when purchasing the highest available tier

This was my first official IT role after deciding to pivot from the commercial airline industry to IT so I didn't know what to expect. 

I also only stayed as long as I did to the COVID shutdown and not wanting to job hunt during that time. The vast majority of my coworkers were former military, which led to a lot of solid SMEs and structure in the dept when I 1st began, but I soon realized the issues of this place was due to a poorly executed corporate merger. The processes in place and communication were just poor. I know mergers can take years (I've experienced three with previous companies), but this one seemed to be excessively poorly planned. Promises were constantly being reneged on. Some employees ended up filing lawsuits due to this. I was hired but did not start the actual role until 6 months later, which was bizarre considered all the security clearances I already had. I stayed because I really wanted experience working with DOD contract companies. Most people hired found other jobs and never actually started. I used that time to wrap up a business that failed during COVID and get some IT certs. I think the company culture in general wasn't great before the merger at HPES and does not seem to be restricted to certain departments. CSC was definitely the more employee centric company before merging with Hewlett Packard ES to form DXC.
Once I found a better role and the covid restrictions were lifted, I left."

PayPal,1,45303,Extremely challenging and complex,Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",,"Compensation packages are generous, especially their RSUs, and they are friendly to completely remote work.","I’ve been at PayPal a relatively short time, and so far, this is the most challenging job of my life with some very questionable management. Personally, I’ve never been more stressed or felt as hopeless in any job, and support from management is underwhelming.

The first thing to note is that you likely will not see any of these problems during your interview process. The interview questions were fair and somewhat difficult, but the experience of working with the engineers was positive. Everyone I interviewed with was extremely polite, patient, and knowledgeable and gave me a fantastic initial impression of the company.

From a technical perspective, the internal software architecture of PayPal is a mess. In addition to being the most siloed organization I’ve ever seen, there are far too many individual services that make up their system. This has the side effect of making even the simplest debugging or coding task almost impossible for any new hire from outside of PayPal to accomplish, regardless of their technical ability. Without at least several years of PayPal proprietary domain knowledge, you will be woefully unequipped to deal with most tasks you are given. The only preparation you have in this regard is a litany of online documents to review during your first few weeks, most of which are very detailed, but still cannot give you enough perspective to understand PayPal’s overly complex flows.

With regard to management, despite knowing the complexities mentioned above and how difficult they are to understand for new hires, they don’t seem to really care when it comes to allocating your tasks. You will likely be overloaded with tasks that you clearly aren’t well equipped to deal with yet, and your manager will likely just ask you to handle it anyway. On top of this, there seems to be a culture of trying to shift blame and “kick the can” around to different teams for incidents regardless of what the data says."

It was a place of growth and learning and opportunity.","In the last 2 years of my tenure, it had become increasingly toxic inside. The pandemic turned it from a job or good work life balance into excessively long work hours and high turnover. I managed two charters with over 50 people working for me. I stayed as long as I could stand it, for them. By the time I left all I needed was anything else less toxic. I’ve heard of only little improvement.

PayPal,1,45276,Toxic developer culture of non-cooperation,Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,"The pay and benefits are good, vacation time is untracked, and you're unlikely to ever get heat for anything because there's very little accountability","All I can say is that PayPal suffers from an intransigent culture of non-cooperation among development groups. Every piece of vital development, deployment, and project nanagement infrastructure is (GitHub, Jira, Jenkins, Slack, Node.js, and on and on) is completely siloed, and the team running within that silo is far more interested in keeping everyone else out of that silo than they are in cooperating for the common good of development teams.

If you ever have a suggestion or a request for a change to one of these infrastructure items, whether it's a direct necessity for one of your project requirements or just something you thought of that would benefit the development experience of everyone using it, the team running that silo will put a truly impressive amount of time and energy into preventing it from happening. They generally go down this ladder of stonewalling tactics:

- Make it as difficult as possible to find out what team is managing the item in question
- Make it as difficult as possible to contact anyone on that team
- When contacted, avoid responding to the inquiry
- When forced to respond by upper management or public pressure, explain how team policy makes it impossible to implement the request (and hope they don't remember that your team policy is self-imposed)
- Perpetually claim to be understaffed. Luckily, it doesn't matter how many dedicated team members you actually have, because nobody will ever call you out for not really being understaffed.
- When some new VP of something or other joins the company and decides to implement a major change and it's all hands on deck, claim you are currently dedicating all resources to that VP's new pet project, regardless of whether your team actually has any connection to the project.
- If all of the above still fails to deter other teams from making requests or suggestions, then just stop responding to them. There is no escalation procedure for interteam conflicts that reaches anyone with any actual authority, so no team is ever held accountable for refusal to cooperate with other teams."

-Titles are meaningless here, it is very hard to get promoted and to get promoted it likely means you have networked more with staff than proven your worth.

The environment used to be one where hard work and creativity were recognized and rewarded, contributing to a vibrant and productive culture.

Lately, however, the atmosphere has shifted. The rise in office politics has made it increasingly difficult for individual achievements to shine through. Remote work, while flexible, has introduced challenges in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, with late-night calls and meetings becoming the norm. This has made it tough to disconnect and recharge, impacting personal time and overall well-being.

Moreover, there’s a growing trend towards relocating projects to the India team and layoffs for cost-saving reasons. While understanding the financial aspects of business decisions, this move raises concerns about the long-term implications on quality and team dynamics."

Because of this, employees have been conditioned to believe they're the best. They're really quite mediocre yet they act like they are better than others. The management consists of engineers internally promoted into management. Stay there long enough and you become Director, Sr. Director, VP, President, etc. The majority of management has no leadership experience outside of Qualcomm and Qualcomm doesn't value training its management. The result is poor leadership that doesn't understand the importance of diversity of thought. The monetary compensation/benefits (salary, bonus, RSUs) is not as competitive as it used to be. The culture has continually degraded over the last decade. A decade ago there was much more innovation happening at all levels, everyone seemed happy around campus and enjoyed talking to each other, and the company provided much more for the employees. After the major 2015 layoffs people started staying in their offices. The fun seemed gone and has never returned. Many fun innovation initiatives were cut. Opportunities provided by Qualcomm for team building among colleagues practically went away."

Excellent benefits. 15% discount stock plan with a lookback. Fantastic health insurance.","Regular late night and early morning calls with India. Work life balance is poor. 

Targeted layoffs for employees over age 50. They claim they don't discriminate based on age, but if you look around at who gets laid off every cycle.... 

Promotion track is extremely political. The promotion from entry-level to journeyman to mid-level is just based on time in seat, but after 10 years exp, you need to be the right guy's friend to advance. 

Management is promoted internally, which means that nearly every manager and director is either a member of the pre-2010 old boys club or the winner of the latest departmental cage fight. 

Incredible amounts of infighting at the director level. Work teams are sabotaged or outright destroyed by Game of Thrones style politics a level above them. 

No training path for juniors. They are just expected to figure things out themselves. 

Morale is in the toilet. WLB and consistent layoffs have the office feeling like a funeral parlor. 

Offshore teams in India are coming for the San Diego workers' jobs, and the SD employees all know it. 

Zero innovation. The same products just get recycled over and over again. QCOM is stagnant technologically. 

Repetitive work. No real career growth. After staff level, you pretty much either just rest and vest, or start playing politics to get on the promotion track. 

If you join Qualcomm in San Diego, simply plan on being laid off in 3 to 5 years. Either you will tick the wrong guy off, your director will tick the wrong guy off, you will age into the danger zone, or an economic downturn will have the C-Suite offshoring your job to Bangalore."

-MANY lame projects happening all over the company;
-This ancient giant has been receding in profits thanks in part to their ""fixed-cost"" accounting model (not sure if GAAP or non-GAAP), so the past year plus they've been scheming how to pinch pennies and keep their reported quarterly profits appearing non-negative. Unfortunately, due to said ""fixed-cost"" accounting model, one of the few things they can adjust to reduce forward reported costs is to reduce total company expenditures on compensation, be it through bonus/salary cuts or ""corporate people movement"" of thousands of workers OFF of the payroll and OUT of the company. Rather than fully embracing the rapidly growing trend (and need) for general-purpose CPUs being accelerated by more specialized and efficient co-processors (e.g., FPGAs from that company Altera y'all bought a few years back), Intel's leadership under Pat Gelsinger has decided to press forward at full-steam towards becoming the TSMC of America and Europe, rather than truly compete with the modern Tech Giants of NVIDIA & AMD, who now dominate the processing IP market. Instead, Intel has decided to DIVEST a **non-controlling** stake in the ownership of Former Altera (The Programmable Solutions Group, or PSG, as Intel so cleverly named it with their acquisition) to the public, in order to raise funds for Intel-main; their strategy is to leverage the most profitable pieces of their conglomeration into ""separate"" (but not independent) companies in order to let the public markets support those effective pieces without having to buy into the stagnant INTC main stock. Besides spinning off the useful pieces of the corporation as contractually Intel-dependent side hustles (rather than truly integrating them into core operations), they are also selling them for their ""parts"" so to speak, as they sell off tech campuses which have housed dedicated employees for decades, without a worry in the world for what this might do to their lousy workers' lives and morale. In fact, anyone who doesn't seem up to snuff to handle such rapid and unpredictable changes is ripe for the chopping block, as the company continues to hunt for any excuse they can find to cut more workers from their books. Intel will be looking to hire thousands of ""new"" workers in ""new"" jobs they will create, but don't expect a fancy tech salary, as those will not be offered to the construction and mass Fab roles they will be trying to fill in Ohio and Arizona. Hopefully their CHIPS Act funding doesn't fall through with this next elected cycle of Government...."

It's hard to go up by even one pay grade by staying in the same job, while other shifts in your module may be hiring on at one pay grade higher than you. That creates a lot of internal movement and teams are constantly cycling in fresh staff to replace the senior staff who have accepted better offers elsewhere in the company (again, sometimes even just by changing shifts).

Good RSU compensation
Depending on the organization & VP you report into, great work-life-balance and meaningful work","Autodesk is constant change of reorgs with VPs departing, orgs being merged, and new VPs arriving. This makes for a fractured company culture and as an employee, its up to you to roll with the changes, often this can make for significant changes to your day-to-day. 

Within PSET (there are a few orgs within Autodesk), there is a top-down leadership culture that is suffocating. Its interesting that Autodesk is considered an innovative company, the pattern over the last few years has been to disempower engineering creativity, push out talented engineers, and replace engineering talent overseas. Cost cutting has been a fixture of Autodesk strategy, not investment in innovation. 

This has created an inefficient engineering culture and a slow pace of delivery. Its recommended to avoid any teams related to the Analytics Data Platform, the VP and the leadership team are unethical and toxic. The VP openly talks about being a 'dictator' (his words), says inappropriate things, often laughs about HR, and plays petty politics. There is a strong vibe that performance is more about 'kissing the ring' than building anything durable and reliable."

It was once a company that promoted growth/leadership but over the last 5 years of my time there, it was more about pushing sausage through the factory and just doing what you are told. It lost the creative element I once loved there so I moved on and have been pretty happy so far."
Autodesk,5,45241,"Change is hard, but we're well positioned for it!",Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,"In a sea of toxic tech companies, Autodesk remains a uniquely positive and inspiring place to build a career. Goals are lofty and change is a given, but at every level of the org, from the very senior ranks on down, there's a sense that everyone is up for the challenge. Top-down vision from leadership is clearly defined, and a lot of space and opportunity to define the ""how"" if you're willing to raise your hand. A lot of new leadership within our C-suite and VP ranks, particularly in Marketing, charged with driving change and transforming Marketing into a growth engine for the company. Despite that challenging mandate, I've found them to be clear on the vision, comfortable in making challenging decisions, and open to pivoting when new information becomes available. No business transformation is ever easy, but as someone who's been through *many* I've been impressed at the leadership's ability to thread the needle between maintaining the culture that makes Autodesk so great and driving the business forward in a meaningful and uniquely different way.","The culture can be very relationship-driven, and because of this, there are areas in which it can feel quite process immature. Getting better, but still present."
Autodesk,3,45197,Culture code does not resonate in all teams,Candidate Support Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","New York, NY","I worked at Autodesk for many years in the Human Resources - PPL department, and I have mixed feelings about my time there. While I had some great colleagues and learned a lot about HR practices, my overall experience ended on a sour note. Great Colleagues: The people I worked with in the HR/CSA team were amazing. Supportive, friendly, and knowledgeable, they made the workplace bearable even during challenging times. Learning Opportunities: I gained valuable experience and skills in HR during my tenure at Autodesk. The company offered numerous opportunities for professional growth.","Laid Off Unfairly: The most significant issue I faced was being laid off due to a restriction and not my job performance. It's disheartening to lose your job when you know you've been doing well. It felt like a slap in the face after years of hard work. Lack of Transparency: The management's communication regarding layoffs was vague at best. It left many of us wondering why we were being let go when there were no prior warnings or discussions about performance issues. Inconsistent Policies: The company's HR policies seemed arbitrary and inconsistent, especially in times of restructuring. It was difficult to understand why some employees were retained while others were let go. Work-Life Balance: HR roles are known for their demanding nature, but the work-life balance at Autodesk was often skewed towards work. Overtime was expected without additional compensation, which further added to the frustration."

Managers with a ""do as I say, not as I do"" (managers and leadership expect individual contributors to adhere to a ""culture code"" but they do not themselves). Constructive feedback comes as a surprise at review time (once a year). Rare positive feedback throughout the year. No growth path or ways to move laterally; you are stuck for years in a role unless the organization changes you to another role. People that have no business being managers are made managers but people that express desire to get there are ignored. Managers are terrible people managers because they are expected to do other things as well - and those other things are what give them ""visibility""."

I'm so much happier since I left 2 years ago. My mental health has greatly improved!

Cons:
- Extreme Micromanagement by the C level senior staff. I had the unfortunate experience of working closely with a C-Level Executive. I was constantly belittled and put down. My boss was a former navy seal so they had a particular mindset, their way or no way. It was extremely toxic and cannot believe I let someone speak to me like that in this day and age. 
- They expect you to work past clocked hours. Also, there were constant unexpected/unscheduled calls to my personal cell phone. Just because I didn't have small children, should NOT give you the permission to call me at 9:00 at night.

It was a truly unpleasant experience and the worst job I ever had. I knew it was time to go after being told the following: 
""You're bad at your job."" (Instead of providing constructive criticism.)
 ""$30,000 doesn't get me up in the morning."" - The God complex was astounding. Then they had the audacity to roll their eyes when I spoke about my experience in a meeting with HR. Extremely rude and unprofessional. I hope they see this and know who they are. :)

I'm now with a company that appreciates me and my boss is wonderful. :)"

They hired some new people and got into the Broadcom acquisition and it all went south - really bad. Pay is still good but that will take a significant hit with Broadcom if the deal ever goes through - in either case VMware will never be the same.,"My team is fine. The devs I work with both here and remote are pretty good but there is too much to do and not enough people.  Unfortunately I work with the design team doing FED for UI. This team was pretty decent until they changed leadership. There are now several foul and horrendous people full of phony warmth and a lot of meaningless process. Designers are burdened with time wasting UX performances that make things hard for them and this trickles down to us. I am very pro-UX when it brings value but this does not. Even worse are the technical people in this group. Along with being unpleasant, full of misery and sadness that turns everything into an unproductive and non-collegial confrontation, they also are straight up unqualified. I have sat in meetings where these people make embarrassing outright errors. Make sure anything you do has ZERO connection with them or you will work in a backstabbing atmosphere of gloom."

They micromanage, and they don’t like remote employees. I’m only speaking for Cloud health and not VMWare. There is a closet racist at the helm of Cloud health. They are very abusive when you don’t hit your numbers and start to micromanage you they promote their friends and they all hang out together. If you’re in the Boston office, management are friends people leave with an a days notice, and you never know why they give their friends the best territories and then make it your fault that your territory is not the best even though data shows that that territory needs to be white spaced overall good company but if you’re a biopic, not the best place.

The company goes out of its way to do nice things for its employees. i'm going to miss VMware and all of the people here once Broadcom destroys the culture and lays off 90% of us.","It's easy to get pigeonholed into a job here, but the company will continue to promote and incentivize you financially to stick with it. There are a lot of tenured directors and senior directors that are in over their heads. Good people, but are not qualified for director level jobs other than having worked their way up at VMware."

VMware,4,45212,VMware gets acquired by Broadcom,Global Account Manager,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","Tulsa, OK","I have worked at VMware for 8+ years now and I it was and extremely enjoyable experience. I am currently dedicated to one very large account. Pay is commensurable, for the work and the team surrounding me are all top notch.","The biggest downside to VMware as I see it is being acquired by Broadcom. Broadcom is a very flat organization and thus the amount of resources I will have to help with my career going forward will be extremely limited. This not to say that my job is no longer doable, it's just to say that I won't be able to leverage some very talented people anymore in my sales process. I'd like to think that these resource reduce our time to market and time to close while solving business critical problems."
VMware,3,45221,Not a visionary company,Staff Performance Engineer,Former Employee,,"VMware is a visionary company in terms of what they are famous for. However, see my comments about working on a product unrelated to what VMware is known for.","VMware is a great company in terms of its primary focus. However, they also have some products that are out of their mainstream. I worked on one of those. The management of this group was completely clueless in terms of the industry, the competition, and the product direction. They have no ambition to make a better product. Instead, they were happy to make a little money based on maintenance revenues from legacy customers. Working in an environment of 2nd and 3rd-rate engineers running on auto-pilot was very frustrating. Had I known this in advance of joining, I would have never signed up."

NTT DATA,4,45339,Mid level job,Network Engineering Advisor,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Atlanta, GA","Working as a Network Engineering Advisor at this company offers an unparalleled experience with its remote work setup, providing the flexibility to craft your own schedule. The autonomy granted allows for a healthy work-life balance, affording ample time to pursue personal interests. One of the most appealing aspects of this position is the opportunity to constantly expand your skill set by delving into cutting-edge technologies, fostering continuous professional growth. This unique combination of flexibility and a commitment to learning makes it an ideal environment for those seeking a dynamic and enriching career in network engineering.","While the remote flexibility is a perk, it can sometimes challenge team collaboration. The absence of in-person interactions may affect camaraderie. The self-driven schedule requires high discipline, and the lack of immediate access to colleagues can result in delayed responses. Despite these, the overall positives make it a compelling opportunity for those thriving in a remote work setting."
NTT DATA,2,45266,No opportunity to gain experience. Leadership out of touch with employees.,Digital Technology Analyst,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"Opportunity for entry level developers to get a position. Interview process was relatively easy - preliminary phone call with recruiter, technical phone call with client, technical video call with client.

Generally good work/life balance. Some clients expect long/unusual hours (e.g., west coast hours for an east coast developer), but on most projects, there is freedom in your schedule.

Direct managers can be good, depending on who you are under.","Lacking actual opportunity to gain experience at the entry level. Many clients want 8 years+ of experience, so many entry level developers are not able to be placed on projects. This results in a lot of bench time or time on projects in non-development roles. 

Work is mundane. Lots of meetings.

Lots of bureaucracy typical of a large company. Employees are restricted from downloading any software, even that which is necessary for development.

New bench policy is 6 weeks of paid bench, then 4 weeks unpaid, after which the individual is let go. Number of bench weeks available resets after 6 uninterrupted months on a client project. While on bench, resources are expected to apply internally for positions on client projects. Previous policy was unlimited bench, and the change was the result of an acquisition.

Poor benefits
 - 2 weeks of PTO that moved up to 3 weeks after company acknowledged that their benefits are poor compared to other companies. No other benefits changes.
 - ""Reimbursement for training"" as a benefit is misleading. Company will not pay unless it is determined there is a business need (i.e., a requirement by the client).

Raises and bonuses are minimal and do not reflect performance whatsoever."
NTT DATA,3,45329,Good for Beginners & Resume Boosting,Field Service Technician,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","New York, NY","The experience can be a big boost to your resume & give you a taste for the highs & lows of Tech work. Some colleagues can provide really good support & insight for navigation with clients, projects & problems.",Upper management as a whole. They try to cut hours & pay as little as much as humanly possible. Staff get calls from management if the deliveries & recoveries run long. Staff do not need to be working slowly for this to happen because if it goes past 1 PM they will call wondering why the staff is not done yet. Some staff can fail the background check & cannot set foot in several sites (such as schools) so they will be almost unable to help.
NTT DATA,5,45329,Great company to work for,Facilities Director,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Denver, CO","The company, at least in my org, does care about the employees. My org also tries hard to maintain a positive culture. We are 100% remote and don't have any real estate for offices outside of sales.

NTT DATA,3,45334,Decent place to work,Software Development Specialist Advisor,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Atlanta, GA","I would not rate this company any higher than their competitors in the same IT Services and Solutions space. In fact, I would rate some of the other companies like, TCS, Infosys, Cognizant to be more Employee friendly.","They have good policies if you are a Green Card Holder or a USC. Not so great for members of work permit visas. In fact, policies are not transparent for VISA holders.

NTT DATA,2,45272,Internal development has no support,Mid Level Engineering Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Salt Lake City, UT","Remote work is the standard, pay is OK","There are no internal resources for code development of demos for prospective clients. No version control or code repositories, no compute resources, extensively blocked web domains for accessing common public development resources and files such as hugging face, drop box, etc. We've been asked to develop and host demo code for prospective clients on our personal machines and github accounts. It's a farce.

Communication with management is tense and generally unproductive, even just in getting clarification on project goals and assignments. Very low-trust culture. Highly disorganized. Roles and responsibilities are consistently unclear. 

No credible possibility of upward mobility. Recent changes to the bench policy push people out of the company if they don't have billable work for a month, but ICs and low-to-mid-level management employees are not empowered to get clients. It's just a form of layoff.

Good engineers. Bad management."

They constantly gloat about how much money they make, but it seems to be largely at the expense of their employees. 

I quit months and months ago and am still dealing with them. They “overpaid” me multiple times after I quit and 6 months later want their money back. After I agree to setup a payment plan to reimburse their mistakes, they continue to lose the checks I’ve been sending them. Then pushing their business burden off on me, requiring I continue to track down checks that they keep losing.

The company is always looking to determine your next role and opportunity.","LinkedIn hires on pedigree and age. Most managers are under 30, directors are under 40, and anyone over 40 is a rarity. Important positions will be staffed based on the university the employee graduated from, rather than work experience. Sales process is being created by recent Ivy League grads who have never sold. Some sales and service director positions have been filled with individuals who are extremely smart but have limited to no experience selling and retaining. The attitude is if you are smart, you can lead any team no matter if you have zero experience doing your staff's actual trade. 

The millennial focus is highlighted in many aspects of the culture. At the 2016 global sales organization meeting, messaging was all about ""you are the best-of-the-best"" and that LinkedIn would not be successful without the individual job you do. Top performers were highlighted in front of thousands of employees. As the employee came to the stage to receive their well deserved award, videos of colleagues commending them were shown. Interspersed among work-centric kudos, the awardee's parents were shown in the videos congratulating their child and stating how proud they were of them. For a non-millennial, it was weird to see their parents congratulating their kid in a work setting. But this is also a company who holds Bring Your Parents to Work Day."

LinkedIn,3,45238,Poor Place to Work,Sr. Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Chicago, IL","I recently concluded my tenure at LinkedIn, and while the platform's mission is one I deeply resonate with, my experience differed from what I had anticipated. I encountered challenges with the company culture that did not align with my personal and professional values. There were instances where the work environment felt less inclusive and supportive than I had hoped for, which impacted my experience negatively. Despite these challenges, I also want to acknowledge the opportunities for learning and growth provided by the company. The ability to connect with a vast network of professionals and access to a variety of resources were definite highlights. For prospective employees, I recommend a thorough consideration of the company culture and values to ensure they align with your expectations. It's essential to find a workplace where you can thrive and feel valued.","While working at LinkedIn, I faced several challenges that shaped my perspective on the company. The team dynamics and company culture did not foster the inclusive and supportive environment that I value in a workplace. Opportunities for advancement seemed limited and were not transparently managed, which often left me and some of my colleagues feeling overlooked and undervalued. Additionally, the feedback mechanisms in place did not always feel effective, with concerns not adequately addressed or acted upon by management. The work-life balance was also a concern, with expectations sometimes extending beyond reasonable working hours without clear compensation or acknowledgment. It's important for potential employees to be aware that while LinkedIn offers a platform with great potential, the internal work environment may not meet everyone's expectations for a positive and progressive workplace."
LinkedIn,2,45331,It's a different company now,Staff Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Sunnyvale, CA","Great benefits, on my team very easy to take DTO & work life balance very realistic.","Constantly changing priorities. Upper management incompetent/rest & vest, middle management powerless to manage up. Culture is not at the center of work life anymore. Constant fear of layoffs, many rounds last year. No raise last year, many more people being placed on PIP than ever. Teams are struggling to keep the lights on. It's not prestigious LinkedIn anymore - just another corporate ""shut up and do what we say"" workplace. A very hard place to work for someone who worked there during the ""glory days"" only a few years ago."

Consider retention bonuses or other means to keep talent. The frustration is palpable.

The company pushes DEI but everyone in sales ops leadership positions has top tier mba and nearly identical resumes. The company seems to understand that exclusively hiring a particular ethnicity or gender would limit perspectives and growth (and is just wrong), but that same thinking doesn’t apply to education and professional experience within sales ops. Our CEO didn’t complete college but there’s a false ivory tower in sales ops for mbas created by mbas. We’d be a better, more productive team without such legacy thinking and more diverse perspectives."

You get to wait for last minute decisions and opaque messaging from leadership together. They spew things about growth and learning but could care less just focus on your cpps and reviews ignore anything that does not support that. Double speak is like air or water at LinkedIn especially from the CEO and C-Suite WLB went down the drain I went from working like 40+ hours a week I'd do some overtime occassionally before ramps and for oncalls at times but it was decent. Near the end it was not uncommon for me to wake up logon remotely as soon as I woke up until like 9 or 10 and night rinse and repeat. They will announce initiatives for new tech and the like every blue moon but very rarely allocate time for teams to execute any of it. Do not be suprised if a project you are working on is cancelled and reorged.
LinkedIn,5,45127,Pinch me because I must be dreaming,Program Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","San Francisco, CA","Going from consulting to LinkedIn was a welcome shock to the system. Overwhelmingly positive vibes from all my team members and everybody I've had the pleasure of working with. Very collaborative environment and plenty of resources for those times you get stuck on something. I've learned as much in 1 year as I did in say 5+ years in my last job. Really can't say enough good things about the environment here. Maybe some would ""toxic positivity"" but it still seems genuine to me. Benefits are pretty standard when compared to other big tech companies. That said, they're outstanding compared to anything else. It's really hard to beat 50% 401k matching up to fed max and almost free, quality health care. I wish I had this kind of maternity/paternity leave earlier in my career. I think it's upwards of 6 months, paid. Random perks like free gym membership, swag, etc. are all great too. Pay and stock options were plenty competitive in my case, although I have heard some say that it's a little average or below compared to Google...but like c'mon that's like saying I won't take a Ferrari because it's not a McLaren. It's still a freaking Ferarri.","Ummm...if you're only after $$$ then you might do better somewhere else, but the compensation is competitive and if you've never worked in big tech it's quite good. Given the current ""macro economic"" cycle there's been some push to ""do more with less"" and some stress about layoffs (LI did a few rounds earlier this year). That said, 5% is a far cry from the upwards of 30% that I've dealt with in the past so YMMV."

The results is accelerating revenue DEGROWTH. This is also the worst possible time because of the scrutiny social media companies are facing after Elon outed many of them for having fake engagement. Customers are losing faith in the product and it shows. There also appears to be the remnants of a culture war present.

1. They do not promote from within, so your Regional Sales Manager will know less than you do about digital marketing, Salesforce, internal contracts & anything relating to internal procedure red tape.
2. This is a cold calling job- period.
3. You will spin your wheels on “renewals” as client cancelations & complaints are the norm. 
4. You will be held to elevated quotas with no explanation or reasonable analytics. 
5. Regardless of tenure & success, you will be fired after 3 months.
6. They claim to be “Client Forward”, however there is no help, concern or actionable procedures for disgruntled clients.
7. It’s a churn & burn environment - for both clients (just cancel them & sell new), or employees (hit the number or we replace you). 
8. Lastly, FindLaw was a great place to work years ago, however with the tiny salaries, huge quotas & no pension or job stability - it has become an entry level playground for the misinformed.

Whether it's through the flexibility of a hybrid work model or the generous leave policies, such as flexible work from anywhere, extended parental leave, and ample annual leave, Mental Health leaves, the company truly prioritizes the well-being of its employees.

•	Favouritism and Potential Retaliation: The existence of managerial favoritism, coupled with a perception that dissenting voices are not welcomed, was concerning. Instances where going against management resulted in active pushback and attempts to sideline an overachieving colleague are particularly troubling.
•	Questionable Handling of Disagreements: A colleague was targeted by middle and senior management for expressing dissent when offering constructive criticism and presenting differing viewpoints.

The only thing that the Thomson children want is to maximize how much money they can squeeze from every resource and human being regardless of how callous and mean-spirited. 

For example, every single year, they have been cutting staff and making the remaining people do more to make up for the employee shortage. For jobs that are critical, they have been offshoring them to India and making the current staff in Eagan train their Indian replacements. I have seen so many co-workers sitting and crying at their desks while the company brings in outside consultants to help boost morale with condescending cheerleaders to make you feel guilty for your own unhappiness. 
""Where is YOUR 'mood elevator' today?""
A decade ago, we had nice cubicles where we had room to work. Over time, individual workspaces were reduced, and reduced, and reduced, to a point now where you are not even allowed to have a picture of your kids at your desk. And for what??? All that space that once allowed people to have a comfortable work area now just sits empty. Literally empty. Where the workstations used to reside have been turned into nothing but empty carpeted areas.
It is clear that this historic company is just being carved up at sold at auction so the Thomson kids can live extravagant lifestyles—completely numb to the suffering they cause their employees.

The lack of professionalism is unimaginable for anyone who has worked elsewhere. All company risk is put on the employer, as the vast majority of our pay was based on event commission. The events you were given were strongly based on favouritism, and often sexism, whereby some people continuously were receiving huge commissions (the main reason why they have stayed!) and others get nothing. The culture is toxic and full of bullies. You are expected to work well beyond contract hours, as it is the only way to attempt to make any commission. Next to no progression, people had to almost beg for any sort of promotion, and when they finally got the role, they were only offered £2-5K more despite a doubling in responsibility.

One of the biggest pros of working at Thomson Reuters is the emphasis on continuous learning and professional growth. The company offers a wide range of training and development programs. TR promotes diversity and inclusion, creating a workplace where individuals from diverse backgrounds are valued and respected. This fosters a culture of creativity and collaboration. TR values work-life balance and offers flexible work arrangements. This helps employees maintain a healthy balance between their professional and personal lives.

TR values internal talent and provides opportunities for career advancement. Employees can grow within the organization. Overall I am happy to be a part of Thomson Reuters.","Competition among employees for promotions or recognition can be intense, leading to a potentially stressful work environment. While TR invests in technology, some employees may face challenges in adapting to new tools and platforms. With a global workforce, communication across different time zones and languages can sometimes be a barrier to effective collaboration. At times, while working in sales I have faced a lot of pressure when I was actually looking for some support.

Lots of opportunity for creativity or ingenuity within your role and leadership generally welcomes ideas and creative suggestions (at least in my org).","Their current push via the CEO Steve Hasker for hybrid work is hypocritical while we also have programs and groups designed to encourage their overall ""work to live not live to work"" philosophy and their more progressive policies for working parents, neurodiverse folks, work from anywhere, etc. It also severely limits employees from growing their career with TR because hybrid roles require physical proximity to only a few places in the U.S. They also are a print company that became a technology company, but so much of their infrastructure is organized horizontally instead of vertically, and the product and tech teams aren't aligned with their front of house coworkers. Working on one part of one product creates a lot of unnecessary silos.

Additionally TR recently launched a sabbatical program (non-paid) up to 6 months every 5 years. While other companies offer paid sabbaticals, I consider it progress. For those expecting a child, TR has one of the best parental leave (birth or adoption) policies out there - globally a minimum of 16 weeks paid leave regardless of gender. For those in the US, that is in addition to FMLA, etc.","Most are pretty meh about the return to office for those that are hybrid.

As they've built out the various teams, often no one is located in the same area, so collaboration becomes difficult. I guess that's just a fact of life through COVID-19 and now as we seem to be transitioning away from that era, but I'm not sure they've thought much about the toll it takes on the collaborative process. What used to be a fun, cohesive, local feel has now become a fragmented, cold, distant feel.

Honeywell,4,45317,Good Company - Just be ready for change,Offering Management,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","Atlanta, GA","Fortunate to have had some terrific managers over the years who have been and still are on my personal board of directors. 

Our current Exec Leadership is evolving, however, while very focused on growth, they are listening and engaging.

Our benefits packages are better than most. While we are middle of the pack in some areas, we do lead in several.

Our Employee Resource Groups create a space for everyone to feel like they belong. They offer ways for community engagement and personal betterment.

Very innovative company, almost too a fault. We are highly invested in R&D which can mean you sometimes forget about all the great NPI we have made.

Amazing team of employees and friends.","All depends on if you are in it for only you or looking at a larger picture. There are many, in every company, who have negative statements about their workplaces. If you know that you are going to work for a large global company and think it will be like working at a small family business, wake up.
Honeywell is there to make money for their shareholders and that can create a fast paced, hard core, very direct environment that not everyone can live/ work in.
Be honest with yourself and know what you are getting into, no matter where you decide to work. After all, it is your decision to accept any/ all job offers and the associated pay/ benefits.

Would say that over the past 5-10 years HR has put us in a very ""woke"" system that is broken. This is one piece that does need attention or you will run the folks with the IP away."
Honeywell,1,45337,Watch out for the Anthem Program,Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Phoenix, AZ","This is specific to Anthem- you might also see ""Next Gen avionics"" in the job description.
You'll be working in a modern environment. No 30-year old cubicles, you're not using obscure tooling like PVCS that you'd be ashamed to put on your resume.
Anthem is a huge priority for Honeywell and gets a lot of attention.","The amount of turnover should speak for itself. Most teams have lost half their members in the last two or three years. One reason for that is that if you work here you will have to compete with up to 20-25 other direct reports for your boss's help.

Don't believe the terms in your offer letter- those 13 days of company holidays? Last year managers told us ""don't plan for December vacations"" despite above-average Q4 performance. Salary might seem ok but raises never track inflation. Work life balance is notoriously bad- a whiteboard here has the quote ""death is not a reason not to close your story"", and after my spouse had a panic attack my leader said ""well we all have work-life issues like that we have to deal with"".

There's a reason Anthem is hiring a lot right now. Customer schedules are at risk and leadership would rather throw more water in the bucket than plug the holes in it. If Anthem were a great team more Honeywell employees would want to switch teams."

- Good opportunities for lateral movement, so many people stay at Honeywell for years
- Some of the Phoenix area sites have made significant improvements in the last five years with ping pong tables, employee events with food provided, and many newer employee clubs
- Most engineers are friendly and I've rarely met toxic or egotistical lower-level employees.","- Honeywell says Innovation is a top priority but somewhere the message gets lost in middle management, and therefore many new products still use code written in the 90s and archaic software tools
- Export control processes have gotten Draconian and un-collaborative. Hope you enjoy typing a business justification for virtually every external email. Many teams have to been told to stop using Excel's real time co-authoring for anything.
- Managers care more about analyzing KPI's and CDR's than understanding the work of entry-level employees that make those KPI's and CDR's happen.
- Program budgets on civil aviation can be disorganized and chaotic. You may work mandatory overtime and then be told to stop working on all customer projects in the same quarter.
- Work-life balance depends heavily on the teams. Sometimes managers barely know what each employee is working on each week, but I've also seen teams where weekend meetings were normal
- Direct managers may be remote, and can sometimes be too hands-off. Good luck getting your manager to appropriately address a dysfunctional team when you've never physically met them and only talk once a month."

Management’s expectations. Your KPIs and goals are insane. Being on 15 customer calls and 8 onsite each week while also putting in 20+ hours of admin work is impossible (the account set is 30 accounts).

Yes, the conditions and benefits are not the worst, but there is a real workload... The work has piled up because if you can't reply to emails in time new ones appear asking you to reply to old ones.
So because of that, all the time there are admissions - some people leave and new people come in and so on. I have been transferred to a new department and when I asked for training, I was told: You already know everything! You've got a fail-safe there,

I am the only member of my team that is required to have my code reviewed, for example - Similarly, if you don't speak and read Chinese you need to use autotranslate for nearly everything, including tons of important documentation that doesn't really translate well from such disparate languages. Most meetings will also be held in Chinese, meaning you will rely on both voice recognition and autotranslate for hour+ long meetings that are mandatory. - About 1/3 of the 'total compensation' for the position is in bonus and stock.

I really liked it but,"I got fired because I work for an app I clock in and out of the app. I clocked in with the app. So I clock out with the app. Service for our phones didn't work. I didn't get the password for the Internet like the others did. I was actually focused on the job. But, I asked her if I could stay for the rest of the shift which was like 10 /15 left. She said no but I was schedule to 4:30 But it was a whatever situation. Again no service. I wrote the time that I actually clocked out on the paper that provided us. But I still also clocked out of the app that I clock in and out to and assuming they will change it because they had the time. They fired me instead. And if not because of that it's because I am pregnant and they knew that. So, for my advice.... I feel like Instead assuming the worse in people thinking that they were trying to get over or something maybe you should ask or understand why I clocked out on the app. It has a location where it shows where I am. Again there is no service in the building at all!!!! I never got the Wi-Fi password. Other than everyone else I was actually focus on the job and not on my phone. And if that wasn't the cause just because someone is pregnant doesn't mean they can't do the job. I am only 9 weeks But I feel that wasn't the case. I really liked the job and felt like I was mistreated by being fired. We have to clock in and out of the app and I let them know and I also ask them if I will be able to get paid for the last 10/15ims of the shift that they said I would be working. Which I am not wrong for asking questions. I feel completely insulted and disrespect my this company."

ByteDance,2,45035,Not a good mix with US Tech Culture,Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"Good compensation. I hear that this has been toned down recently, but it was definitely good when I was hired. Good buildings. The offices in the Bay Area are of high quality. Wide desks. Privacy separators between desks. There are walkways around desk blocks. Good lighting. Great view of the hills/mountains from the San Jose and Mountain View offices. Decent benefits for a T1 tech company. Not as good as Google, but competitive all the same. Large numbers of highly technically proficient people. They know their stuff and you can really tell early on that you're working with people who have heads on their shoulders.","Incompetent management. This is partly due to how the company is structed in a flat manner, but they also put accomplished ICs into low-level management positions where they start out managing several dozen (30+) people which is about 3x too many. The next level of manager commonly has 100+ direct reports. It's way too much work to place on far too few managers, so management tends to be incompetent. Because of this, ""managing up"" is required for a successful career simply because you have to manage yourself and then let your manager present that to his own manager. Incompatible tech cultures. Bytedance is a Chinese company and it really shows in how they do work in China vs. the US. There is a heavy emphasis on unity/harmony in the workplace which manifests as doing what you are told by the higher ups. You do not dissent, you do not disagree, you do not discuss. Doing so can cause visible signs of discomfort and it's common for them to feign agreement in order to end whatever discussion is going on. Incredible focus on short-term, measurable gains. It's led to a hodge-podge of outdated tech stacks mixed with highly customized forked open-source tools with no long-term plans for upstream merges or actual maintenance. Code is frequently copy-pasted, code reviews are practically nonexistent, docs are written almost purely for performance review and so read more like advertisements than technical documents. Very political. Working cross-team can be very difficult. People jealously guard their work and seem to be constantly in fear of any project that could lower the impact of their own work. Bad projects are kept alive and used far longer than is reasonably justifiable due to politics. Good projects cannot get off of the ground because some higher up somewhere doesn't think it's a good idea. There are committees and bureaucracy everywhere for all sorts of things and approval is commonly multi-stage."

- Good documentation. I didn't love documenting until I entered this company. You could easily find answers to problems by simply searching the documents. The Lark Document was a great product.

- Lack of manpower all the time. I often felt overwhelmed but didn't have coworkers to delegate some tasks. In hiring new employees, HR didn't help much, we were on our own.

Amazon Web Services,4,45306,Amazon SWE Experience,Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Seattle, WA","Scale and Impact: Amazon operates at an enormous scale, allowing SWEs to work on projects with significant impact and visibility.

Learning Opportunities: Amazon is known for its fast-paced and challenging work environment, providing engineers with ample opportunities to learn and grow in their careers.

Innovation: The company encourages innovation, and engineers often have the chance to work on cutting-edge technologies and contribute to projects that can shape the industry.

Compensation and Benefits: Amazon typically offers competitive salaries and a comprehensive benefits package, including stock options, health insurance, and other perks.

Networking: Working at Amazon provides the opportunity to collaborate with smart and driven professionals, facilitating valuable networking and skill-building.","Work-Life Balance: Amazon is notorious for its demanding work culture, and some employees report challenges in maintaining a healthy work-life balance due to long working hours and high expectations.

Pressure and Stress: The fast-paced nature of Amazon's business can lead to high levels of stress and pressure, particularly during peak periods or when tight deadlines need to be met.

Hierarchy and Bureaucracy: Some employees feel that the company's organizational structure can be bureaucratic, making it challenging to implement changes quickly.

Limited Ownership: In a large organization like Amazon, some engineers may feel that they have limited ownership over their projects or that decision-making is concentrated at higher levels.

High Turnover: The competitive nature of the tech industry can lead to high turnover, with some engineers leaving for other opportunities after a relatively short tenure."
Amazon Web Services,3,45334,"Depends on the team, but also declining rapidly",Software Engineer,Current Employee,,"Many different product offerings, so there is always something interesting being developed. Don't like what you're doing? Internally transfer to another team that peaks your interest.

Great internal tooling and services. Its very simple to build something new and focus on the parts you care about, rather all of the boilerplate stuff. There is a bit of tedium here and there, but generally the documentation is great.

Many teams are highly distributed. Nearly everything that you do in those teams has massive customer impact and hence visibility. It feels rewarding seeing your work pay off immediately in metrics/customer experience. This also opens up many doors for promotions.

Extremely talented and smart people work here. You'll learn a lot from them and they'll help advance your career.","The s-team is completely out of touch. They make short sighted decisions for temporary gain. People are frustrated with them, and their lack of transparency, sympathy, and communication. Managers are unable to do anything, all decisions made by the s-team are final. Its difficult to stay motivated in such an environment. The talent is already bleeding, and it will only get worse.

WLB is highly dependent on your team. That being said, oncall tends to be awful and drives down WLB."
Amazon Web Services,4,45334,"Great company, great benefits but redondant work and office like call center ",Associate Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Montreal, QC","The work pace is slow, and the manager overall is not very demanding and understanding of work-life balance, competitive salary, and benefits with RSU.","There is a lot of technical stuff to learn; for non-tech people, I don't recommend that you need to study for three months (paid) to pass the ASA (google this). It's super hard and won't be directly used with your work. There are no clear guidelines about workflow or targets, as AWS is like a utility service with no direct mentorship. Overall, the organization is too big; you don't always understand with whom you work and for what; you're attached to a team, but you work solo... The big corporate wasn't a fit for me and my personality."
Amazon Web Services,5,45317,You will certainly land on your feet,Security and Compliance Specialist,Current Employee,,"Compared to most corporates I have worked for, AWS have ripped up the rule book for roles.  As an individual contributor you have a choice to do lots of tasks that would normally be the domain of managers or  marketing.  For example, interviewing new hires and speaking at major events are there if you want them.  I feel sorry for graduates who start their career here when they eventually move they will realise just how much AWS raises the bar in terms of opportunity and fun.  For old dogs like me its a great place to winter out the tail end of a career.","The bar for internal promotion is higher than the bar for entry for a given level.  Attention fatigue and decision paralysis because there are so many opportunities to choose from you can get side tracked.

With competitive compensation, a focus on work-life balance, and the potential for widespread recognition, this role embodies both reward and impact in the ever-evolving landscape of cloud technology","While being a Principal Solutions Architect at AWS is rewarding, it comes with challenges. The role often demands long hours and intense workloads, especially during project peaks, impacting work-life balance at times. Keeping pace with rapidly evolving technologies requires a continuous commitment to learning and staying updated, which can be demanding. Additionally, balancing diverse stakeholder expectations and navigating complex organizational structures within clients' environments can present communication and coordination challenges.

My mental health, physical health, and sleep got a lot worse when I was here. I gained weight and developed insomnia.

Knowing that Monday would come with more problems and ""fires"" I would need to put out on my clients. I was regularly on 3-5+ projects at once and it was the most exhausted I've ever been in my corporate life. The culture is very much sink or swim.

Competitive Compensation: AWS offers competitive salaries and benefits, including stock options, which is a big plus in the tech industry.","High-Pressure Environment: The fast-paced nature of work at AWS can be quite demanding, often requiring extra hours and tight deadlines.
Constant Change: The rapid rate of change and growth can sometimes lead to ambiguity in roles and responsibilities.
Large Company Bureaucracy: Navigating through the company's policies and procedures can sometimes be challenging due to its vast size.

Amazon Web Services,2,45321,Stressful and Unnecessary,Account Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Washington, DC",Product can sell itself and the growth during the pandemic was probably the last of their boom times. Can make a good living. Best part of working at AWS is that you can leave for anywhere you want and it will likely be a cake walk in comparison of workload.,"Never been so exploited in my life. After two straight years of overachieving quota I was told they were “thinking” of putting me on a plan, which was an axe over my head. Manager literally told me my success was like a tree falling in the woods (you know the rest), even though I was on a team with over 30 people on it which made it impossible to get noticed because my manager played favorites with certain demographics who did much less work. I was also told because I wasn’t apart of any DEI groups I had a target on my back. Had a new team member get promoted to Team Lead within 4 months of being on the team and our 1:1s turned into me coaching them. Management also has to select people to put on plan every year regardless of performance, which explains why they couldn’t give me a solid explanation of why they wanted to get rid of me. 

I was told to do work that had nothing to do with my job which gave me an avg workday of about 10-12 hours at my desk. Your management will abuse you then ask you for ways to help them get promoted. Many of whom were cycled through new leadership roles within a year.

2 years after working there I still resent the time I wasted slaving away for them. Luckily this was during the pandemic so I didn’t have much else to do but it’s an extremely tolling culture. In any other sales org you are rewarded for hitting your number but here that was only one small piece of what it takes to get noticed. They will tell you everyone is an Army of One when you come on. Your experience at other companies will not matter and they will even put you down for it."

If you're not experienced in big company politics, you're going to get taken for a fool very quickly The quality of leadership is below the standard expected.

Marketing roles are actually more operations than anything else
Advice to job seekers: do not take a general marketing position, take a specialized position so that you can manage your own workload by telling people you can't get to things and are overloaded which just means the general marketing managers have to do it themselves along with their countless other weekly jobs. This is the only way to maintain an 8 hour workday. Discuss all the projects you can in meetings (even if they aren't your own) and do this confidently since many managers can't tell the difference between confidence and competence so you'll be looked upon favorably over those don't spend time to toot their own horn"

Continual layoffs, moving all our jobs offshore to India or Mexico...

Massive inner circle and if you do not complement the MD constantly you will be out. Even those that did often found themselves being kicked out.

Nielsen,2,45163,Marketing organization going down hill,Marketing,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","New York, NY","First and foremost, the office location in New York was undeniably a bright spot. The NY office is situated in a vibrant and convenient area, the office provided a pleasant environment for work. The surrounding amenities and accessibility added a touch of convenience that was certainly appreciated. The provision of quality IT equipment demonstrated a commitment to ensuring that employees had the necessary tools to perform their tasks efficiently.","Nielsen underwent a privatization last year and subsequent large-scale layoffs. This restructuring resulted in a reduced team size, leaving those of us who remained to shoulder an overwhelming workload. The aftermath of the layoffs led to an atmosphere of stress, pushing us to our limits and unreasonably long working hours. It's disheartening to witness how the workforce reduction, instead of streamlining operations, has resulted in an excessive burden on the remaining employees. Adding to the turmoil is the noticeable presence of a clique-like culture, largely comprised of individuals who had migrated from Wells Fargo, the former workplace of our Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). A particularly vexing issue was the intricate process of getting things done. What should have been straightforward tasks often transformed into arduous journeys due to an overwhelming number of processes and procedures. The layers of bureaucracy and red tape are disproportionate to the team's size, making even the simplest accomplishments feel like monumental achievements."

Long time employees with years of knowledge and experience are being terminated so their job can be taken by someone overseas with no experience and little training. This will have a severely negative outcome to the future of the company.

Good company in that regard for compensating with what should be provided to workers, besides salary. Varied in regards to daily clients that one meets, homes and locations. Interesting industry and processes. Corporate environment based attitudes - a lot of SOPs so processes are thoroughly understood, clear in direction and requirements. Company wants to ensure rules are followed. A lot of internal clients to assist in daily work flow. If you do the job, you should be successful.","Monotonous, grind, not intellectually stimulating, kool-aide drinking mentality amongst middle management and upper management. Middle management is reminiscent of employees from ""stereotypical"" DMV or Welfare/State run facilities, can be a biased work environment, where middle management has a lesser evolved recognition of self and picks favorites. So ability to earn money can be minimized by bias. Base salary is an unlivable wage in San Diego, unless you rent and have someone else contributing to daily living necessities.

You just don’t report to an office but have constant virtual team meetings. Constant unrealistic goals of singing homes in some of the most rural areas no matter the weather. Most of the time you drive for hours just to find out people are either not home or not interested in what you are selling. Even if we aren’t really selling anything. We are offering “free” money to just watch tv as they normally do, but because it cost nothing to participate most people think it’s a scam. The truth is there are a lot of restrictions to actually finding a compatible home willing to partake in a Nielsen ratings tv survey. Initial recruitment is too long of a process where you visit the same house over and over again. Most people could care less about a few hundred bucks over a 2 year period. Plus once they sign up the equipment needed to be installed is a hassle and you don’t get paid if field tech is unable to do the install. Pay is a joke for the time involved!"

New team had no direction after the first round of lay offs took out crucial roles for their daily functioning. 

Felt like I was hired to be laid off. Upper management I personally dealt with was very socially awkward and difficult to work with- this was not necessarily their fault but lack of emotional intelligence and basic sociability was rough to deal with in terms of communication. 

Also the health insurance is the worst I’ve ever had and Nielsen is by far the biggest company I’ve ever worked for."

It was really a joke and I am happy that I left that dysfunctional org. They don’t know how to set the sales targets and no brain to fix situation. They recently adopted sales force but because of inefficiency in leadership, they created excels and everyone was requested to keep them up-to-date …I hope someday they understand the proper use of salesforce. I found similar tendency among people worked only for Nielsen for long time. After the reorganization, those long term contributors(?) were given leadership(?) titles but they were not equipped with any skillset required for sales leaders. They happily put senior title roles and congratulate each other.. same type of people flock together and they are not first class. In my region, people say that a real brilliant people never consider to join this company and I understood it true. And it was a big mistake that I chose it. So my advice to job seekers is, better to avoid if you have anything else to do."

Economic Efficiency: Tech Mahindra's services can provide cost-effective solutions for businesses, especially in the IT sector, potentially stimulating economic growth.","1. Cultural Discrepancies: A preference for UK culture over local culture can create inequality and division among employees. 2. Disorganization: Disorganized acquisition, hiring, transfer, and promotion processes from the management down can hinder productivity and job satisfaction. Significant breakdown in communication interdepartmentally from the point of employee acquisition and onward. 3. Political Environment: Internal politics regarding employee onboarding and offloading can lead to a lack of trust in decision-making. Poor Quality Help Desk/Service Desk: Subpar support services can cause frustration and productivity loss. 4. Communication Breakdown: Lack of transparency from management can create uncertainty and lower morale. 5. Lack of Training and Guidance: Insufficient training and guidance can hinder skill development and overall productivity. 6. Favoritism in Hiring: Cultural preferences leading to the placement of underqualified individuals in higher roles can create a toxic work environment. 7. Unscrupulous Employee Acquisition Practices: Ethical concerns arise from the company's methods of acquiring and converting employees from other companies. 8. Negative Impact on Job Security: Conversion of permanent employees to contract workers (often after just one year of acquisition) minimizes job security and contributes to overall employment instability. 9. Contributing to Unemployment Crisis: Tech Mahindra's workforce practices may exacerbate the unemployment crisis by underpaying, mistreating, and offloading employees for cheaper labor with their practice of buying out all technical companies and services to build one giant (tech company), to gain greater control of the market & then consolidate employees within the organization. 10. Exploitative Wages: The company is notorious for underpaying professionals and specialists competitive, market - value rates, often taking advantage of newly acquired personnel during their short-notice transfers resulting from Tech Mahindra's acquisition of the employees' original employers, teams, depts, and roles, etc."

- HR-wise you can take compensation days of the holidays worked, also, they are really supportive at sickness, family occurrences, even studies if you have exams or else.
- Good health insurance that you can down or upgrade the perks; extra bonus available
- HR really works to improve and streamline processes, different than front line ones gang.","- The casual atmosphere makes it like a secondary high school environment, with lots of pettiness, and overall childish behaviour both from admins to management. It really feels like the pupils vs the instructors and directors as mostly comprised of young hires fresh of college due to the brand of the project and no special skillset needed, which again propels immature behaviours all across.
- Management can be messy at times, chooses its favourites based on information exchanged about others, and tasks that can't do as part of their job and delegates to admins;
- The supposed PiPs don't really help improve anything since the quality of the work itself is evaluated at the discretion of FTEs on client's side, coupled with the ever changing nature of the workflow.
- Can I mention again immature and childish behaviour?"
Genpact,5,45286,Review,Management Trainee,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Noida,"I have had the privilege of being a part of an extraordinary company for the past 1.5 years, and I can confidently say that it has been an incredible experience. From day one, I was greeted with warmth and enthusiasm by my colleagues, creating a positive and inclusive work environment.

One of the most remarkable aspects of this company is its unwavering commitment to excellence. The management team consistently sets high standards and provides the necessary support and resources for employees to reach their full potential. The culture fosters collaboration, creativity, and innovation, encouraging everyone to contribute their unique talents.

Not only does the company prioritize professional growth, but it also places immense value on personal development. Through various training programs, workshops, and mentorship opportunities, I have been able to enhance my skills and broaden my knowledge base. This continuous investment in employee growth sets this company apart from the rest.

Another aspect that deserves praise is the company's dedication to work-life balance. They understand that a happy and well-rounded employee is a more productive one. With flexible work arrangements and supportive policies, the company creates an environment where individuals can thrive in their professional lives while also maintaining a healthy personal life.

Lastly, the company's core values are not just empty words on a wall; they are genuinely lived and upheld by everyone. The culture of respect, integrity, and inclusivity is palpable, making every individual feel valued and appreciated.

In conclusion, my journey with this exceptional company has been nothing short of amazing. From the supportive work environment to the emphasis on growth and work-life balance, it is evident that this company truly cares about its employees. I look forward to many more years of success and growth in this remarkable organization.",There is nothing to mention about yat now.

They will make you cry, if you want to take leave or work from home. They will mark unapproved if your relationship is not so good with management. They just want to please them everytime.

Salary Concerns: While the company offers opportunities for professional growth, there are consistent complaints about below-average salaries, making it a less attractive option for those seeking competitive compensation.

Genpact,2,45279,"Upon joining, my interactions with the manager were positive",Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Greater Noida,"As an employee at Genpact, a prominent multinational corporation with purported job security assurances, my journey began in 2022, lured by promises of a secure professional haven. The enticing prospect was further sweetened with monetary benefits, including a generous joining bonus and relocation assistance, surpassing my initial expectations.","Empty Promises on Night Shift Benefits:

Following an abrupt shift to the night shift, promises of monetary benefits were made during a discussion with the manager.
Unfortunately, these assurances turned out to be mere lip service, as the promised benefits failed to materialize over the subsequent six months.
Disillusionment with False Benefits:

The passage of time only deepened the sense of disillusionment, as employees grappled with the realization that the benefits pledged were nothing more than illusory commitments.
Team Resizing Decisions Influenced by Management:

The seemingly arbitrary decision to resize the team was purportedly influenced by client demands.
However, suspicions arose that the management played a pivotal role in shaping this decision, contributing to a sense of mistrust among employees.
In essence, the cons within this scenario are characterized by unfulfilled promises of night shift benefits and the subsequent disappointment stemming from false assurances. Additionally, the perception that management wielded influence over team resizing decisions further eroded trust in the organization's commitment to transparent and employee-centric practices."

Genpact,2,45324,"Used to be really good, but that’s the past",Assistant Vice President,"Former Employee, more than 10 years","Danbury, CT",Some really talented and dedicated people still work here. It’s a large organisation that has a good reputation still in the industry.,"Specific to US healthcare consulting only - Extremely poor leadership, toxic culture,
not people centric at all, abject failure of leadership to invest in sales growth means every revenue generating employee also made responsible for additional sales - without any training or handholding. If they cannot sell, they better be prepared to ship out. People are managed based on perception rather than actual data and facts. The annual performance review is joke. They fired a lot of competent people in the last 3-4 years, especially those who helped build the consulting business and now the incompetent leadership just looks to pass the buck and look for excuses and scapegoats for their failures. Every 12-18 months, there is new leader who talks big, threatens with a big stick while quietly and constantly applying for opportunities elsewhere and leaving at the first available opportunity. Neither can they handle the pressure coming from the top nor do they have the skills required to achieve the growth targets. And thus, they put the pressure of growth on the mid-junior management to grow the business and make life miserable for them. Service delivery excellence, client satisfaction and being continuously billable is just “hygiene” for the leadership. And then the leader moves on to another organization, leaving the business poorer and in a worse condition than it was before they joined. The US Healthcare consulting business is little more than a meat shop and where people go to destroy their careers. Pressure on growing the business means mid level managers try to dupe gullible clients into over-staffing on projects for additional billing. They claim to be “partners” in growth for their clients but the fact is they always viewed as a mediocre, non-IT, staff augmentation company. 

At an overall organization level, the outgoing CEO (Tiger) was much more people centric and has shaped the organisation over the last 12 years but was shown the door earlier than planned. Now have a real hatchet man (internal company rumors) ready to take on the helm. The incumbent CEO’s very first town hall was not hopeful or motivating. It was depressing, dark and full of foreboding messages of ominous times for the employees who cannot sell."

In some scenarios, its an Operation driven decision making while HR is simply on loop, hence you may see people getting promoted without clearing minimum criteria industry-wise. Hence, internally, folks my be holding good designations but once they look out, they may get a reality shock. Also, being a captive, you are only good as the account you worked for. Genpact makes people do certain courses on their GENOME Learning platform, but they do not publish any certification for the completion of those courses to their employees, so many employees are trained on many tools and other domains but can't prove it anywhere due to lack of a certificate. There are other account level activities which certain employees take care of but can't showcase it anywhere regarding those experiences except talk about it. Folks get rewarded through cheers points for such adhoc efforts but again, there is no written recognition given to employees. Also, the 90 days notice period is indirectly an entrapment which forces many never to leave or take huge risk and resign with no offer in hand."

Incompetency and greed is cemented in the company structure. Harsh layoffs. Frequent and souless.

I liked that workers of any gender had access to 16 weeks of bonding leave. I was given an opportunity to switch roles/responsibilities during my leave, and I thought this was a sign of good company support! (I do not think this anymore... please see below.)","The tech I was working on was not particularly new or fresh. I was working on interesting problems, but it was not very exciting. Layoffs are the second huge bummer. This was true when my teammates were laid off, and then (of course) when I was laid off less than two months after I was back from my parental leave. I was transitioning into a new role, so navigating that transition while also transitioning into working motherhood, and felt kind of set up to be on the chopping block.

The technology is very interesting and engaging to work on. The scale and scope of the technology and manufacturing process is decidedly cool. The problems the company faces are measured in angstroms and dPPM, and it has the capability of measuring both extremely well. The work/life balance is a mixed experience. Overall the company is run by people who value working 60+ hours a week and being on call 24/7, but there's space for existing here at a more appropriate rate for your health and wellbeing. People generally understand that we all have family responsibilities, and that a healthy body is critical for a productive mind.","Executives are enforcing yes man tendencies, and getting routinely blindsided. The company broke export laws, and was fined 300M. The executives cut 300M in employee salary to cover the costs, which has netted a 30% employee reduction in the last 6 months. The company leadership isn't taking ownership of their responsibility for that decision. Employee wages are getting cut to fund stock dividend payments. The company budget for employee wages is now approximately 1/3rd the company budget for stock dividends. Promotions are drastically suppressed, and when they do happen are either made because the person in question is politically well established, or it's made out of desperation to retain employees. There is a chronic lack of vision about retaining and growing talent and leadership in an increasingly close to retirement age population. Critical departments are chronically understaffed, and when they do manage to pick up a competent or exceptional new hire, they quickly leave due to lack of career progression. Timelines for programs are so compressed that innovation is suppressed. Lack of personnel in critical departments is suppressing innovation. Lack of investment into innovation gets turned into poor management decisions when it comes time that we need massive changes. Risk tolerance is a bizarre mixture of extreme aversion to change, and totally impervious to potential downsides."

There are smaller companies that will pay almost double for the same position and rank. This shows not only financially, but also in the average level of talent of engineers. There are some great engineers at the company but the overall average skill level is pretty poor, putting a lot more pressure on the better engineers to perform past their limits to keep things moving.

There is also a very big value on company politics at the senior management levels. A lot of decisions are made to make the next guy up the latter happy rather than making the work of the engineers easier or more efficient."

-The culture is geared towards inclusion with Employee Resource Groups for the LGBT+ community, BIPOC communities, Neuro-divergent people, and others. 
-Generally laid back work culture as well. As long as you get your work done on time most people will leave you alone. 
-Benefits are good compared to other engineering companies.","-You will be paid less than your peers at other companies. If you ask for more management will give you lip-service about ""tight budgets"" and promotions are tied to time spent working at the company rather than the quality or the amount of work you are completing. 
-Be ready for lay-offs which will increase your workload and then a slow hiring process to get those people back once the company recovers. Co-workers will also be able to offer little support during these times as they will also be overloaded with work. 
-Most people in upper-level management roles will be out of touch and egotistical, do not depend on anyone but your manager to have your back. Be ready to keep your head down and say ""yes sir/ma'am"" when they ask something ridiculous of you as any criticism directed up the chain is unacceptable. -This is also true of any program leads. They will have a very ""holier than thou"" attitude especially if you need something from them. 
-The leadership is constantly makes decisions that make work harder than it needs to be. Recently these decisions have been mandating 40 hours of training without providing support for employees to find that training. Employees are expected to complete it on their own time. Additionally, the IT infrastructure is so restrictive that you often have to wait 2 days for them to do something on the back-end before you can even begin your work. 
-Very little vertical or horizontal mobility. Be prepared to work in your position for years without any changes other than to your workload. 
-The vast majority of the workforce is near retirement age and the company will do very little to retain new talent. Expect a very high turnover rate for younger workers at the company."

It’s been a pleasure working with great individuals who make the workplace enjoyable and collaborative. Innovative Environment: The company fosters an innovative and dynamic atmosphere that encourages us to think outside the box and come up with fresh ideas.. Living the Company Values: Booking.com takes its values seriously, and I've been impressed by the commitment to integrity, excellence, and a passion for travel. The values are not just words on paper but are lived and practiced by everyone. Fantastic Benefits: The benefits package at Booking.com is superb, the company truly cares about its employees' well-being and growth. Modern Office Space: The Manchester office space reflects the company's commitment to creating a comfortable and inspiring workplace and is a reflection of the company's forward-thinking approach. Customer-Centric and People-Focused: There is a big focus on customers and employees that’s evident in everything the company does. It's not just about business; it's about creating exceptional experiences for both customers and employees.",It's a shame that regardless of skill and previous experience you're unable to apply for another role within the company within 9 months of having started.

You will make friends there, and it's a fantastic place to connect with, learn from, and grow with others. It's also a great place to learn - especially in the early days of your career. You can get a lot of exposure to a variety of projects and there's always something new happening. You WILL grow and you will learn a ton!","The sheer size of the organization, paired with the very rapid growth makes it a high-risk place for bad work-life balance, high stress, and burn-out is quite common... To make it there, you need to learn to set good boundaries, and be mindful of your own needs and limits.

Top-Down company. Teams has barely any say in what they will be working on, even if they prove it's good for the business. Any work the team has is dictated from above by 'company priorities' - WLB is a matter of politics. Some employees are working unreasonable hours and others work less than 40 hours a week. You can often see a couple of people in each team who hold the rest of the team on their back while their peers (who understand how the politics works) do the bare minimum - Getting promoted is mainly about politics.

Low maturity of agile WoW. No room for self steering teams. Decisions and priorities are hardly made by leadership or changed constantly. Difficulty to grow in the organization. Management doesn’t look at how to bring the best out of people and to use people’s talent, but stuck in politics and hierarchy.

Fantastic office & benefits. Carefully built, welcoming culture of learning, experimentation, mentoring, and growth. I've never seen anything like this :) Interesting technical challenges given the high load: *to an extent*. Tech part is not the company's strong suite if you're comparing this to FAANG, but if you're in a team that doesn't actively maintain 20-years-old legacy, it's fine.","1. Not a tech company at its heart. A lot of things that in Google or Facebook or wherever would be done by dedicated DevOps or infrastructure team, are done by product devs with a bunch of bash scripts/cron jobs. This leads to some frustration and some wasted time. If you have ambitions of making a new programming language, developing the coolest in-house cloud in the world, or something equally risky and large-scale - Booking is probably not the right place. 2. Ancient tech stack that is literally older than me. This is improving, but not as fast as you would hope, partly because of p.1: people are focused on improving the product, and not necessarily streamlining development. I'm working with a relatively modern tech stack (recent Java), and I try to stay away from the legacy code. If you're interviewing for a job - be sure to ask about the tech stack of your specific team."

Was good before the whole integration and change of leadership.

Your workload is mostly seeking trivial technical clarity which can be answered by reading documentation that never existed or someone legacy (really what are legacies doing here? chilling at home?), and patching a sloppy mssql back end or anything equal to that.

Incompetent person in leadership who is going to call you at 7pm for sprint planning. Also they won't have any idea what are you doing because .NET engineers are trivial here in their head, so if you ever have offer for this position just avoid unless you're desperate.

Most arrogant director who is absent at FY and proudly showing a massive slide of him traveling with big text saying thank you in Japanese written in alphabet.

 I have to wait the financial person to cut a cake to get a clarification about tax, in place!? awkward so say, so awkward I never worked in a company with HR as inhospitable as this. 

Truest definition of iceberg of ignorance, instead of involved in hiring process, they have to enforce 2 years contract to make the candidate not premature-quit. 

Massive sized traditional Japanese company formed with countless time of merging.

(NATO, European Parliament, European Investment Bank);","Lack of flexibility:
- They sell you the company and organization as very flexible in terms of changing projects, responsibilities, remote working, but in practice it is not the case;
- You will be working 100% on-site even if they inform you that it is 3/2, hybrid, that's a lie;

Underpayment and Overwork:
- You will noticed rapidly that if you are directly contracted by NTT you are at a loss, contractors, freelancers and CDI through another companies that have contracts with NTT get paid 2 or even 3 times more than you;
- They will drop everything on you because you are 100% on-site, while the workload for contractors is minimal, direct employees have to deal with everything, from moving box to complex troubleshooting and designing.

Benefits:
- The so called allowances and benefits are subject to constant changes and voting by the ""board of directors"", one day they sell you the contract with an array of benefits, next week you have none, be careful;
- I was offered a relocation package of 2000€ for Luxembourg which can barely cover a single month of accommodation if you are moving with your family, if you chose to leave within less than 5 years, they will make you pay every single cent.

Payment, Over time, On Call:
- They make you report every single minute, it feels like you are working for a monitoring company;
- They do NOT correspond to the amount of reporting asked for, I went 2, 3 even 4 months with unpaid overtime, I'm talking working 2, 3 weekends straight with 10h+ per day, that combined with the fact that you receive 1/2 1/3 of what the contractors do.

Payroll and HR:
- There is a single person for each sector and they have little to no knowledge of how things work in Luxembourg, I received no instructions whatsoever, overpaid taxes for about 5 months because they messed up my tax card."

HubSpot,2,45328,Unmet Potential: HubSpot's Vision Falters in the Shadows of a Fractured Culture,Business Systems Analyst,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Cambridge, MA","HubSpot has a great overall compensation package, amenities, and resources for employees. The framework for greatness exists, and with the right leadership, I believe the envisioned excellence will be attained.","While HubSpot flaunts a truly impressive compensation package, top-notch amenities, and ample resources, there's an underlying sense that the organization is yet to realize its full potential. 

Regrettably, HubSpot appears to be a mere shell of the once-rumored #2 Best Place to Work. The initially touted culture serves as a tantalizing facade to lure in top talent, but as the veneer fades, a toxic underbelly of ""high-performance"" becomes increasingly apparent. What may seem like ones unbridled cynicism post-recruitment and during the theatrics of employee orientation soon reveals itself as a stark reality over time. In my brief two-year tenure, I witnessed an alarming level of turnover, layoffs, and burnout, surpassing the cumulative experiences of my multi-decade career. Remarkable individual contributors and stellar managers struggled against the tide, their efforts to foster an authentic company culture often thwarted. Exceptional leaders and contributors were, at times, driven away by the tenured and toxic gatekeepers, resulting in a very disheartening overall experience."
HubSpot,3,45264,AE's Be Advised - Terminated Before My 1yr,Account Executive,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",,"Hubspot is a worldclass leader in CRM/Marketing/Sales software, and has really created a phenomenal platform as well as marketing strategy for the platform. #1 platform in the industry, so you've got a great platform to sell. Overall, great company culture despite the way my journey ended.","I started in January, 2023 and was terminated the week after Thanksgiving, 2023. We all know tech sales have been a real challenge in 2023, but my experience at Hubspot may have prompted an exit from SaaS altogether. 

If we look at it from a numbers game, I was terminated at 86% attainment. I was struggling...had been for months. When I joined, I was told inbound should cover (approximately) 40-50% of quota, and the rest would be outbound. The reality? 10-20% each month. It was an uphill climb from day one. I know many reps who are also struggling and are looking for their next role elsewhere. I was anticipating starting PIP in December, I had joined a sales/tech coaching group, meeting w/ my manager 2x/week, meeting w/ high-performers and coming at it from every single angle I knew how all while it was taking an enormous toll on my mental health. 

Instead of PIP, HR joined my 1:1 with my manager and I was promptly let go. I admittedly wasn't super successful, but this was a really disappointing way to leave a company after I had invested so much time and energy and I never got a PIP to try to turn things around."
HubSpot,2,45309,Used to be a “best place to work”,Senior Account Executive,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,The product is best in class. The business outlook is fine as of now.,"Hubspot really was a best place to work at one time. Those of us who were there were lucky to have experienced that. 

I could write out a lot here, but it really boils down to: my experience is that hubspot cares about its employees and customers about as much as your average large corporation. 

It’s not the worst place to work, but it’s not an amazing place to work anymore. 

In my opinion, on average, employees seem a little unhappy and a bit disconnected from the mission. There are a lot of arbitrary KPIs to make up for lack of context/experience in some of leadership. Many who are coming from outside of hubspot and, in my experience, don’t necessarily understand what goes into the jobs of those around them. My experience is that you have to be ruthless or cut-throat to be successful. Cash compensation is on the lower end and there are many upcoming changes."
HubSpot,2,45315,It went downhill...FAST!,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,#NAME?,"I worked at HubSpot pre-Covid. The energy and support I felt from other HubSpotters way back when was amazing. It got the company through the hard early days of lockdown - then the surge in business that came right after. We supported each other through the good and the bad. HEART wasn't just a culture slogan but how most HubSpotters approached each other and their customers. 
But then something changed. ""High performance culture"" came in. Another way of saying we'll get rid of anyone for any reason we want. No more trying to lift up your fellow HubSpotter and supporting each other through challenges and tough times. Micromanagement took over and the vibe turned to Survivor. So many long time employees and leaders have left the company recently. It's become like any other big software company."
HubSpot,2,45339,High expectations,Finance,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Indianapolis, IN",The stock based compensation is a great benefit.,"Even though they are full remote and offer unlimited PTO, I am never able to take time off. I have even had my manager decline a vacation request during a non busy work time. I am unable to have appointments during the workday because my manager schedules meeting over them or constantly slacks me during the appointment. She also slacks me at all hours of the day. There is no work life balance. The expectation is you are on the clock 24/7 and must be available at all time. Another con is the promotion process is extremely slow. If you want to get promoted, even if your manager agrees, be prepared to have to prove it over three performance cycles and document extremely high performance."
HubSpot,1,45308,Overly focused on race and gender identity,Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Cambridge, MA",The pay was pretty good,"It's incredibly difficult to get promoted, unless you're a women or have a diverse gender identity, then its incredibly easy. Apparently, that's not problematic at all. They even brag about having over 50% women in leadership positions, that includes trans women, and that's how they do it. 

The CEO (also female) admits they're doing it on purpose, and even makes public company blog posts, and posts on women empowerment job sites about how they do it, completely oblivious to their bigotry and misandry. 

When the woman team lead, with only 4 years of junior level experience stepped down because it was too hard, they immediately promoted another woman with only 2 years of full experience who proceeded to ruin every project our team got due to lack of experience.

Even though I had 8 years of experience, I was never even asked or considered for a promotion in that area. I found another job pretty quickly, I'm currently at the team lead level in a Texas based company. One that is not overly woke."
HubSpot,3,45166,"Great company, needs better management",Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Chicago, IL","It's a great company with great benefits. Truly, I loved the culture and felt that they cared about their employees (very different from previous employers). There are plenty of one-off benefits that actually made me feel valued. When I exceeded quota, my manager sent me a nice bottle of champagne which really made me feel valued. Compensation is fair for the role and commission structure is very clear. No concerns about being cheated out of what you earned. Ramp is a full year, so it gives you time to learn the product and get comfortable with the role. Truthfully, it's an enjoyable and welcoming place to work. THe people are the best and I made real friends there despite the WFH environment.","A lottttt of meetings. I spent almost 2 hours a day in internal meetings. Truly a waste of time and annoying. Management also needs some work. The sales managers take way too much time off and don't really take the time to support their team. My manager, specifically, was out for a total of 3 months throughout the one year I was there. It was truly shocking. Unrealistic expectations. You'll be hired for an inbound sales role, then will never receive a single lead (FYI I'm fine selling OB, but to be hired for one role and receive a salary for that role then not receive the tools for it seems wild.)"
HubSpot,1,45340,The company has gone downhill since the layoff in 2023,Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Cambridge, MA",It used to be a good company until the layoff,"2022, they said they are not going to lay off anybody. The finance looked good. Then they laid off 7% of their workforce in 2023. 2024 comes, the company morale was at their lowest. They said There won't be another layoff, then they laid off bunch of UX Designers, and Katie Burke and bunch of HR people around her left. I bet the company told her to leave or something"
HubSpot,2,45328,"Used to love, but steadily getting worse and no longer recommend",Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"The remote/hybrid culture is fine here, but this isn't enough to recommend the company to others.","When I joined HubSpot several years ago, I had heard great things and felt strongly aligned with the culture of the company. It felt like they didn't just ""talk the talk."" However, over the past few years, it feels like it has become the epitome of toxic positivity. They continue to use their Culture Code to explain things like consistent reductions, decrease in benefits, lowered performance reviews, etc. I haven't even been hugely impacted myself by these, but it's disappointing to see and it's made worse by leadership speaking as if we're watching a Ted Talk. 

In addition, there are some really shameful DI&B changes that have disappointed me hugely. For instance, on my team, every single person who has been let go has been a person of color. Speaking with management about disability accommodations during COVID spikes was a terrible experience. I know from fellow coworkers that there is truly disappointing treatment of parents on parental leave. My own personal experience as a marginalized employee has been so bad that if I had the resources and time, I would have moved forward with an employment discrimination lawyer, but at this point I'd rather just get out. 

The company feels like a sinking ship with constant scaling back of benefits, roles, compensation, equity, etc. There's no oversight of individual managers, and it feels like every time there's a company announcement, it doesn’t land with the broader company."
HubSpot,3,45306,"Rolling a bit downhill, at least for sales.",Small Business Account Executive,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Cambridge, MA",GREAT product you can believe in,"Huge changes these past couple of years. General vibe at the moment is that it feels like like the ""glory days"" of selling at HubSpot at past us. They used to brag and celebrate how much they worked into rep attainment, number of reps at P Club, and work/life balance. All of that has dropped away almost entirely and they only seem to be taking steps further to go towards the culture of any other large corp business out there. Still a great place to work, but far off the ""best place to work"" status of the past imo."

The office is in an easily accessible walkable location and is well equipped with amenities.","The company is very aggressive and heavy handed with its culture which is very political and very far left radical. To provide a more welcoming and constructive environment for all of its employees, politics should (and traditionally were) kept out of the office, but not so at HubSpot.

Regarding team dynamics, teams are set up to look good on paper, but managers are focused on completing rituals and voicing slogans while being indifferent to the progress and success of employees or else being too afraid of confrontation to actually make expectations clear. Supervisors have no interest in training new staff on company resources and company paradigms and merely wish to insert staff as cogs in the machine rather than preparing them for excellence and a greater contribution.

There also appear to be higher management schemes to fish for justification to push employees out of the company as a backdoor approach to layoffs, rather than being straightforward."
HubSpot,1,45329,WARNING: Smoke & Mirrors Ahead,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,,Individual contributors are deeply passionate about their work and play a vital role in preserving the founders' vision and values. The company used to be an exceptional workplace under the guidance of Brian and Dharmesh.,"Since the onset of COVID-19 and the transition in C-level leadership, the company's guiding principles have shifted from one aimed at building a legacy our grandchildren would admire to fostering a culture of rapid turnover, prioritizing perception over substance.

I'm excited to see what they can do. Great PTO. HS also does a great job of supporting big life moments, good and bad. I really appreciate the human touch and empathy the company takes here. Lots of cons, but some of these are pervasive in tech and not unique to HS sadly.","- HubSpot is like a high school clique where those that are ""insiders"" are protected and promoted often at the expense of more skilled, smarter, mature, and more empathetic leaders. If you don't ""fit in"" to the HS way, you won't go anywhere and the ""HS way"", at least in product, often favors the men that have been here a long time and are now at the top. See the other brave reviewers here that have spoken out about how HS treats people with differing opinions, styles, etc. - We also vastly undervalue design and this seems to be getting worse by the day. We hire such talented designers and then don't give them the room or voice to lend their expertise. - Over the past year, the amount of autonomy of teams has dissipated. While this is to be expected as a company scales, some parts of this org now have highly paid, smart, and skilled IC's and middle managers who are basically just executing on the orders from people at the very top (again beware if you voice a different opinion)."

The next door is locked. They seldom promote from within the Support team, and when they do they parade it around like a youtuber giving $50 to a homeless man. They like to talk about appreciation, and mental health, and career growth, but make no effort to provide any opportunities for those things. They will strait up lie to you and then punish you for calling out the lie. Look at how many other people in the company say they would absolutely never do the job that support does, or allow themselves to be treated the way support does. Last year they laid off 500 people, 7% of the company, ""spread evenly across all departments"" but some how it was just under half of the support team, we spend the whole year struggling under heavy volume and all they did was demand more, then get upset when we took time off because it was getting to be too much.

I cannot stress enough, DO NOT apply to this job. There are plenty of similar roles with similar pay and benefits that wont leave you so stressed out that you need to see a therapist. Don't believe the crap about this being a great place to work. It was under Halligan, but for the support team at least this has not been a even a good place to work for a long time, and they absolutely don't care."

Good benefits
Fully remote","HEART is baloney. In the sales org there are extreme levels of micromanagement, from AE managers who don't know what they're doing. Many of HubSpot's sales managers were promoted internally because they performed well back when things were great and inbound leads alone would get you close to quota. Now that inbound leads have dried up and reps are struggling, the majority of managers have no idea what to do other than yell ""make more calls!"" or ""we need more pipeline!"" When you ask for advice, they'll offer no valuable insight, they'll just tell you to call your old leads you've already called 100 times. Or make you try to strong arm your prospects into signing on the spot (HubSpot sales managers love the used car salesman tactics). ""Coaching"" from your manager is often borderline bullying, offering no actionable advice and instead just picking you apart to make you feel worthless.

Your ability to succeed is extremely dependent on the manager you get and the install capacity you get assigned. If you don't luck out on both of these, long term success will be extremely difficult. Your next best bet will be to suck up to your manager and try to become one of their favorites, because management here will absolutely give you preferential treatment with passing you leads & opportunities if you're one of their favorites. 

My team is a team of 8 reps. In 2023, one by one, 4 of my teammates were put on PIPs and ultimately fired. A fifth teammate was put on a PIP but got off it. That's to say, in a single calendar year, our manager PIP'd 62.5% of the team and fired 50% of the team... in one year! It's sales so naturally there will always be some of this, but you gotta ask yourself - is it normal to PIP 62.5% of a team and fire 50% of that team in one year? Do you want to work at a place that does that? Most of those reps were hardworkers and had done well in the past, but were quickly PIP'd after a bad month or two.

Unless you're a star performer & management's darling rep, you'll work under constant stress & fear of being put on a PIP and fired. Most AEs here do, I know HubSpot has been a huge burden on my mental health compared to my previous sales jobs. The KPIs are unrealistic so if you want to succeed you'll be putting in plenty more than 40 hours/week."

Because it's been marketed as a benefit, I have used it to its full extent—and most people do! But I've also received push back from managers when ""it might not be a good time to go on vacation.""

FWIW, I would prefer a company policy that strictly outlines the number of vacation days we can use, but HubSpot still—on average—navigates these situations well."

This company treat tenured people differently than new people. If you’ve been at the company for years, even if you are not performing and not delivering, as long as you have good relationship from the old days, you will be taken care of. New people can’t make mistake and will be forced out immediately if not being perceived doing well. In my department, the SVP only cares about how she looks in front of other leaders. There’s no interest in coaching and helping new people to be successful. Not only she doesn’t giving the team support, she would stab at their back to look good in front of other leaders. As a result, people can’t trust the management People works really hard to deliver the work demand, but itfeelsy very transactional in everything we do, because there’s no real empathy or care.

We are building a high performance culture and just don't have the support needed for this. It is causing so much burn out. Biggest issue for me is growth. They put barriers in place to prevent growth. If you get a sometimes meets expectations on a performance review you can not apply for internal positions for 6 months. Even if the role has nothing to do with the internal position. Even if the hiring manager doesn't care. In my case, I am not the best Customer Service rep, I'm finally hitting metrics but because I struggle with customer service I can't apply for a software dev job even though the skills are completely different. To me this is judging a fish on its ability to climb. Help people get to positions that their skill sets allow them to succeed. I want to like my job and I used to love it here. If management would be willing to work with me this would be a different story but they won't do anything.

You get to work against other teams and compete to be better than all the rest, the best like no one ever was. You might get to work with a leader that doesn't assign you the same task also assigned to several others, unbeknownst to you. You can take unlimited vacation and fall behind your co-workers on their way to a promotion before you, even though you completed everything in good order. You get a high chance of taking on work that will not get recognized because the leader that designed the project was confused and can't understand if there's any business value. You might still have some of the benefits advertised by the time you start. You might have a chance to switch teams or move internally if leadership thinks a new shiny title and rebranding an existing role are important in the next year.","This is a complete bureaucracy now. Any merit based teams are few and far between. Those teams are also probably not hiring, as they are being forced to conform or actively being managed out by being given unrealistic expectations.

I raised concerns about my manager which were ignored by upper leadership and it resulted in multiple retaliations, an internal whistleblower investigation, and ultimately short after the investigation’s conclusion, was let go ( although they made it a point to let me know they do not retaliate against employees who file whistleblower complaints) - if you are neurodivergent, not able-bodied, a person of color, a woman, etc my strong recommendation would be to avoid this company like the plague. If you do not conform, you will be sidelined and most likely let go eventually. I know of a few former employees that have really bad interactions with this company behind close door. Please be careful and consider other options"
HubSpot,3,45189,wish it ended differently,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"HubSpot's culture offers a myriad of appealing qualities, some of which include a strong emphasis on autonomy and ownership, at least on certain teams. The organization has demonstrated an openness to remote work options for virtually all employees, allowing for flexibility in terms of work hours and styles. My colleagues were, by and large, truly exceptional. Working alongside such talented and remarkable colleagues was a valuable experience, and I had the privilege of forming enduring friendships with many of them. While the compensation didn't reach the heights of FAANG-level packages, it was quite competitive. Additionally, the inclusion of unlimited paid time off was a notable perk.","In light of the shifting economic landscape, the organizational culture has undergone a notable transformation. What was once characterized by autonomy and trust has evolved into a situation marked by increased micromanagement and a prevailing sense of apprehension. The company's emphasis on cultivating a ""high-performance culture"" has resulted in a proliferation of performance improvement plans, terminations, and layoffs, despite prior assurances from executive leadership that every possible measure would be taken to prevent such outcomes. While some layoffs ostensibly were performance-based, others affected individuals who had never received unfavorable performance evaluations or been provided an opportunity to rectify any deficiencies. Following the layoffs, several of these individuals have been informed that they are ineligible for rehire, even as many of the previously eliminated positions have been reposted and new hires made. It is the perceived lack of transparency that proves most disconcerting—asserting that the layoffs were objective and driven by the fact that positions were no longer needed, only to promptly replace those who were let go. I'd have preferred to be told directly that it was based on performance. At least be transparent. Furthermore, amidst the escalating trend of micromanagement affecting lower-level employees, there seems to be a conspicuous dearth of oversight when it comes to the actions of top leaders. Ineffectual management goes unnoticed and unaddressed, and clear favoritism exists, granting a select few an audience even when their perspective may be misguided or based on inaccurate information."

The types of questions that consistently come up on calls and via email lead to me sifting through many, many Slack channels in desperate attempt for answers.

If you are coming from a Salesforce, are super organized, and land on the right team with a good territory you will be great!!","You are very unlikely to make it out of your first year of Ramp Of my hiring class almost 50% were put on a pip and/or fired The managers have an actual incentive to continue to bring on new reps while pipping/firing under 1 year reps to keep their team number low, while they send good leads to tenured reps They provide very little training - managers do not have a ton of product knowledge and there is no formal training program Lots of noise and unfocused strategy - Strategy seems last minute and ad hoc. CRM DATA IS A MESS ---- This was a major shock for me because it adds an insane amount of admin work on your plate, think old contacts, duplicate records, and records that don't connect to our actual customer database. They ask you to hit prospecting metrics with extremely few tools and a messy crm which makes it super frustrating. Territories are unfair - Reps who have been there for 2+ years know every trick in the book and have bloated books of businesses by skirting around rules. Managers pass leads to tenured reps Leadership protects managers who churn through new reps, they say it's a mishirebut its really just bad or poorly trained managers Straddling the fence between a true enterprise org and a smb/mid-market org - they expect you to be running small transactional deals while executing complex deals with 10+ team member deal teams. This is nearly impossible with the amount of time in the day, messy crm data, metric expectations (ie calls, emails, activities and tasks), and internal meetings (there are a ton) VP of sales says we are on quarterly quota when you are actually on monthly quota. The sales cycle length is quarterly. You can hit your yearly, and quarterly numbers and be fired on missing a month.

Your health and well-being is genuinely important to others here, and you can feel it, and it creates a great culture of taking care of each other.

It's not a problem if you are a go-getter and like to figure things out for yourself (which I am), but I would have expected more clearly defined processes to help new-hires understand what is expected and the steps taken to get to the same result. Everyone seems to be doing their own methods which is fine, but that can create inconsistency with end results and doesn't work as well when scaling a team or onboarding new hires.

C-Suite determine new customers based on slack channel crowd-sourcing to ensure they don’t hurt employees feelings.

Employees with differing views are shunned and the internal liberal echo chamber is loud. Separately, the lay-offs were a mess. Top performers with highest marks were let go and their managers had no idea after CEO said “we aren’t doing layoffs”. People with many years at the company under their belt with families cut with no reason. Intense metric based micromanagement has created a world of cut throat cover your neck and throw anyone you can under the bus.

There is no context that can explain low numbers and no compassion for employees. I personally know a mentor-type person with years of experience who was cut loose in recent months after their numbers dropped due to stress caused by their move across the country, and the general burn-out culture we work in 40 hours a week.

You have the luck of the draw every month to see how many accounts you'll get with cancelations. But you're now also expected to up sell or cross sell. I'm not a sales rep! The worst part is our job is to tell people they can't cancel and be cold hearted to those in dire financial situations. HubSpot no longer cares for the employees or customers.

- Good sales enablement stack
- Nice hardware for us to use
- Decent Work/Life balance
- HubSpot on your resume
- Week of rest in July
- VQR for sales reps to get quota relief when they take PTO","- Something about asking new hires to leave reviews irritates me. HubSpot has enough new hires to manipulate/skew Glassdoor. I'd recommend sorting out one-line five-star reviews. They are not genuine.

- Leadership is atrocious. The worst that I've ever seen. See, there are two kinds of people at HubSpot in Sales. 1. Those with lots of RSUs understand the HubSpot game (Drink the Cool-Aid and know your place). 2. Folks who want to build their career at a great company are left out to dry.

- Underpaid relative to unrealistic quota. They are not honest about quota attainment and failure is encouraged in many ways as it helps leaders exceed their goals. 

- Product only competes competitively in one area (Marketing)

- Turnover is really bad. No one brings their authentic self to work as you will be judged and mistreated as a result. Believe me, you do not want to be the cranky wheel at HubSpot. 

- Worst AE support I've seen. No one at HubSpot will help you. Not your manager, not your SE (they don't do demos or much at all). You will succeed or fail and it's 100% on you. 

- No exit interview upon departure.

- Fought company to get earned commissions. 

- Managers have off-sites, reps stay and work. Never met a HubSpot colleague in my 2+ years."

This company has the opposite values of any company I'd like to work for long term.

FDM Group,5,45194,Good experience,Consultant,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Houston, TX","Currently FDM allows remote work, which I have greatly appreciated during my time with the company. I’ve gained great experience while working here since I’ve been placed with a large financial client. FDM offers an 8 week training program to prepare you for whatever role you’re seeking. I was in the Business Analysis training, so we learned SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Project management (waterfall and agile/scrum). They even had training on professional etiquette which is great for recent grads. I had an overall good experience while with the company.","Have to sign a 2-year contract for employment, meaning you’re not allowed to quit or else you will incur fees. So Make sure you’re prepared to give them 2 years at the salary they offer! You’re only eligible for salary pay once placed with a client, which starts at about 45k, which increases to 47k, and finally 50k after a certain amount of time. Before being placed with a client, you will make an hourly pay of $15/hr (New York minimum wage- which is where FDM is based out of). If you’re working remotely from another state, understand you will be paying New York taxes as well. Yes the pay is low but this industry won’t look at candidates who have no experience (regardless if you have a degree or not), so I bit the bullet to get 2 years of experience while getting paid instead of paying for these expensive boot camps that are out there."

Meet Many People Going Into The Same Field as You","Recruiters can make enticing promises that no one will explain or apologize for. I had already accepted that taking a job at FDM meant moving away, but a recruiter had alluded to the fact that there was an opportunity in my city he'd tell me about once I had signed up. This, of course, never materialized, and I was pushed into another role in a city over with no explanation on what that was about. 
Little/nebulous amount of choice in which company you work for. It felt like I was thrown at whoever said yes first with very little interest in what other opportunities I had. I was assigned a role in Week 2 of training. (My advice to people in interviewing during training is to keep interviewing regardless of who they think you should say yes to. Or even if you have a role already.)
Training courses taper off in quality after the first 6 - 7 lessons. one course ended in an unsupervised algorithm self-study when the lecturer was apparently also tasked with an important presentation.
Assignment can have nothing to to with your training. In fact, it can actually be a whole other pipeline of training. I went through 8+ weeks of training in one technical pipeline (when it had been know since week 2 that my assignment was something else entirely) and then given 3 week to get two technical certifications, one of which claimed to have required 2 years of experience with a certain technology to be able to obtain.
While FDM allows the company you're contracted with to hire you at the end of two years, it's unclear how interested they are in helping that process along. There's nothing in writing encouraging the other party to make this process timely, and I know of a case where FDM (unbeknownst to the employee) extended a contract with the company without asking. Moreover, FDM seems widely absent from the conversion process."

FDM Group,2,45047,Resume Builder,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,Great place to build some experience for 1-2 years before moving to a more reputable company. Generally the people are good (below executive mgmt). Typically their offices are located in cool parts of the respective cities they operate in.,"Executive leadership is so resistant to change it's crazy. They work with Fortune 50 companies who all push back on their 2 year consultant contract period, yet as a company with only 4,000 employees globally they refuse to adapt to the needs and wants of their core customers, who have 100k plus employees. The pay is pretty poor, especially if you are a consultant. They are so focused on their profits that they prioritize them over their people, especially their consultants. Executive leadership is pretty corrupt, if you aren't related to the family or from the UK, your odds of moving up are pretty slim."

2) You will meet a lot of peers who are also trying to start their careers.

3) Health/vision/dental benefits kick in during training.","1) You will work for around a month before ever receiving a paycheck .

2) $15/hr until you work on-site with a client.

3) Lower end $50K - $60K salary as a consultant (ramps up every 6 months).

4) You are locked into 2 year contract with the client; leaving FDM before then incurs a $15K fee (their value for training).

5) Account managers who facilitate client placement vary immensely in quality/professionalism.

6) Minimal support is provided after training is completed; you are mostly on your own to maintain and improve your skills. 

7) Projects done after training but before client placement are poorly managed and have no full-time staff oversight.

8) Poor communication overall - decisions are constantly made that not all staff are aware of, or in agreement on. There's a general impression that a lot of people are trying their best but winging it."

-The trainers, for the most part, do a good job. The quality of your training is entirely up to the amount of work you willing to put into it. Don't try? You won't get far.

-The exposure to different clients via interviews and events really helps you to gain an understanding about what corporate looks for in a candidate. (This will be really helpful when you're looking for jobs on your own.)

-No one talks about it but the benefits are really good. My health insurance is incredible.","-Pay is bad. $12/hr during training, $45k-$50k during your 2 years as a consultant. If you have to relocate, expenses such as Rent, food, gas add up fast. It's completely manageable though.

-Geoflexible i.e. You must be ready to move ANYWHERE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE. I'm not kidding. If you get an interview for a position on the other side of the country and you get the job, pack your bags kid, you're going. Don't want to? You'll have to pay $30k to break the contract. Yeah.

While some of the points raised are specific to Avanade ASG (Austria, Switzerland, Germany), others are global concerns, which I will clearly identify.

TL;DR: Multiple employees are expressing dissatisfaction with recent changes, limited learning opportunities, and an overwhelming emphasis on chargeability.

Specific concerns:
- Limited interaction and knowledge sharing: While Avanade positions itself as a global company, collaboration between Avanade ASG and other offices seems restricted. Additionally, internal knowledge sharing lacks structure, hindering learning and growth compared to established consulting firms like BCG or McKinsey.
- Management background and focus: The Avanade ASG leadership, largely composed of ex-Accenture and Microsoft personnel, might lack direct customer acquisition experience. This potentially limits client engagement and results in repetitive ""success stories"" without active presales efforts.
- Global reorganization and its impact: Recent changes imposing chargeability on all employees are allegedly dampening morale. Additionally, concerns exist about the lack of focus on developing the sales pipeline.
- Leadership continuity and employee morale: Some new leaders, reportedly involved in previous cultural breakdowns at Accenture, might be contributing to similar concerns at Avanade. Many recent hires have expressed surprise and disappointment with the current company culture, particularly regarding the recent end-of-year review process and lack of bonuses.

Overall, there appears to be a need for addressing employee concerns regarding company direction, learning opportunities, and leadership effectiveness."

- No Culture or effort to get people from the practice together.
- Management will not be interested in you
- A large number of very experienced consultants across Europe, but again due to lack of a community, you´ll get no help
- Easier to get a new job than to go through the promotion cycle
- HR really isn't interested in you
- They list a career mentor as a perk. Don't be fooled, this is just your line manager.
- More money is spent marketing on D&I marketing than actually making it a nice place to work for everyone 
- No bonus or pay raise even with high growth and huge profits"

Management by fear instead of what the company was built on.

A lot of great things too but I was not capable of identifying if it was a good company to work for or not.

You know what? Consultancy companies are, in general, the worst place to look for work-life balance and the best to learn, make money, and grow. Avanade is a consultancy company but it's impressive how it is well served with benefits and culture. If I have to choose a consultancy company to work at, I think here we have a great reality (of course, if compared with other consultancy companies I worked at)

Company Car, a lot of other types of bonuses, discounts on some stores... They even give the possibility to buy Accenture Shares at 15% off. It's a well-structured company with GREAT experts. I mean, ""la crème de la crème"". Microsoft MVP, well-certified and updated people... There's a lot of room for learning","The greatest part of the work comes from Accenture. They usually don't know what they are doing or the technologies involved in the project. I really can't understand why companies decide to spend a lot more money with them (and they then call our experts) instead of coming directly to us. We have great business analysts who are experts in various technologies and ACN people usually can even say what's doable and what is not. It usually is a big problem when the client arrives with a lot of high expectations

Then... it's a consultancy company. Don't expect to have the greatest work-life balance. I don't have anything to complain about it by now but by lucky. Still, a lot of colleagues had to work late or all night long sometimes, even during Christmas or other holidays... But, again, I challenge anyone to name a consultancy company where this is not a reality from time to time. It depends on the project you are in. If you are one of the lucky ones, then enjoy your time."

If you’re unfortunate enough to be placed on their projects it’s a disaster and mix of political games to survive. Accenture’s optimal strategy is to extract maximum value from their clients and deliver minimal in return. To that end Avanade is just a means to achieve this. Competence means nothing if you’re given teams of people with 0 experience in the technologies your delivering in and culture of being transparent about that with your client is none existent. To much middle management Promotion is a politics game and not value or talent driven. Will regularly charge you out at higher grades (sometimes 2x) in order to make profit but are reluctant to promote to those grades despite many years of good performance at those grades.

They have to check up on their own wellness and do their own reports in the app. Only given directions on how to collect food at stores by a certain time period. They are expected to double check on items. Then they are expected to just deliver to certain places based on the map projections on the app however in this case it does have directions to follow. No coaching on how to engage with customers either. Drivers are expected to communicate to customers politely even if they don’t know how to do so. Expected to know how to take clear and proper photos of food items and delivery locations. Sometimes there are other scenarios that riders are not prepared for like being forced to take 2 orders at 1 time or restaurants taking too long to prepare the food. Not much growth opportunities here, mainly just social skills and geographical skills. The tasks are always strongly correlated to each other without much variety and is extremely repetitive."

foodpanda,1,45304,Management and HR will scam you,Senior Commercial Data Analyst,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Singapore,"flexible working hours, food credit, pandapro subscription","management/ leadership will scam you out of a raise when they can and will not be transparent about the promotion process. they refuse to put anything in writing and are only looking out for themselves while increasing their own salaries.

They constantly change KPI targets to make them unreachable so that employees are unable to unlock the benefits and thus also their full salary.

Goal post is constantly being moved for employees and employees are expected to take on extra roles and work for no extra compensation.

No direction for growth and constant restructuring other than leadership getting to keep their jobs unless they get into a scandal like the ex ceo who divulged private information to the public when it was still under discussion

Leadership will never answer questions directly and when they do it's the most non answer possible where they dance around it

I don't recommend working here as they will constantly lowball you with your salary even after promotions. 

They will promise you a mid year raise for your promotion in the beginning of the year and stab you in the back and say the midyear raise is only applicable to those who got promoted in the midyear cycle"
foodpanda,2,45293,Be wary of signing on - things aren't very stable,S S E(Senior Software Engineer),"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"Great people, never had any issues while collaborating across international teams. Plus it's fun to work on an app that I actually use all the time.","Things are not stable at the company right now - I was part of the last round of layoffs right before Christmas. foodpanda in Southeast Asian markets are rumored to be sold off soon, and I assume the layoffs were related to that rumor. There have been multiple CEO and executive replacements just in the past year. If you're just looking for any job, sure go ahead and apply, but don't have any short term career goals you're trying to achieve because you might suddenly be laid off before you achieve them.

Also, they are obsessed with process here. Too much focus on process (written documents, going through committees and reviews etc) that it takes forever to actually get to build anything. I spent so much time on ""engineering excellence"" - test coverage, refactoring, etc. because our product features still weren't approved."

foodpanda,4,45290,Decent Money for Time Flexibility,Food Delivery Cyclist,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Hong Kong,"You get control your time for the most part. Once hired by the company, Food Panda HK will require you to download an application specifically designed for riders/cyclists. Once you open the app, a calendar section will open up that will allow you to choose a time schedule, allowing you to either work for 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, or the entire day. Absences or failure to show up once a schedule is selected doesn't mean termination or punishment. It just means that you get sent to a ""lower-tier"" group of riders who get to pick their shifts/schedules at a much later time compared to the ""high-tier"" batch of riders who never miss a schedule or time-slot. This all means that you can choose when to work, for how long, and if you wanna work everyday, every other day, even one time a week!","Try not to work during the day time if possible. It is better to work at night, perhaps from 8-9PM onwards. This will eliminate the most annoying variable you will encounter which is traffic. When working at night, you can average 100-120 HKD per hour as a cyclist. Riders can earn way more than that (Usually Double the amount but the distance from restaurant to customer is usually longer). Sometimes, the rider app is unstable or no orders will come your way, so that means you probably won't earn that day. To be fair, this happens like 5 percent of the time. Lunch time can be a hassle due to the surge of orders but that also means that you can earn almost 100 dollars in less than 30 minutes."
foodpanda,3,45215,"Good benefits, but too much politic",Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Kuala Lumpur,"Generally good benefit, good policy from global. Non-discriminatory policy due to the nature being an European company.","Despite being a global startup, there is a lot of red tape and layers that hinder any innovation. Local politic are very bad, need to always be in a camp to survive - global management don't care despite comprehensive HR policies. Global people are often condescending, their analyst technique and strategy application are 5 years behind compared to Asia. Try hard to be relevant all the time. Always tell local need to respect their timing, but they expect us to reply at 12am and that's okay? No sense of urgency as they're distant to the on-ground business. At local level it's a dog-eat-dog world to survive, but in regional/global, you can be 'repurposed' to a new function if you're not performing or don't like what you're doing. It's a wonder how they're still pushing for EBITDA+."

Lots of communication yet everything is opaque to most employees. Highly siloed and cliquish. Senior management is well-intentioned but not addressing structural issues which is leading to a focus on shiny-object syndrome versus deliver excellence. Struggles to take cross-functional integration seriously which puts downward pressure on practitioners to manufacture opportunities with zero authority and minimal agency which works exceptionally well for a handful of folks who’ve been there for a long time or have plum positions that they protect viciously. Project work is often never aligned to skill set as much as who likes you or does not. Career development is an afterthought, especially for more specialized or senior folks. Pay and benefits are average. Layoffs happen suddenly and quietly with no warning yet aren’t fully acknowledged by the business internally or externally.

They will only make you full time from contractor for your hard work but will low ball on salary. Many people dont become full time because of this low balling. Once after becoming full time there is no way one can have competetive market salary by staying with the company. Multi level unnecessary micro management is another issue.

There are constant reorgs, new priorities and initiatives, and continuous asks to keep cutting costs. ALL promotions and headcount increases have been denied for over a year citing budget constraints. All year there have been silent layoffs with no announcement which has created a very high level of anxiety among remaining employees.

It's been a journey filled with ups and downs, and I'd like to share my perspective. Let's start with the positives. If you're fortunate enough to have a good manager, consider yourself lucky. They can be your guiding light in an organization that often seems to have lost its way. However, the management style in general tends to lean heavily towards micromanagement, which can be stifling and counterproductive at times. It's hard to thrive when you constantly feel like someone is looking over your shoulder, pushing you for more, even when you're already outperforming your peers. One of the most significant issues I've observed is the sheer number of initiatives the company pursues simultaneously. While ambition is admirable, it often feels like a scattered approach, where resources and attention are spread too thin. It can be challenging to excel in an environment where you're expected to juggle so many tasks, and it sometimes feels like a lack of clear direction. Furthermore, there's been a noticeable shift in the company's priorities. We used to have a budget allocated for partner meetings and in-office engagement, which contributed to a sense of camaraderie and motivation. However, that's no longer the case, despite the company's financial success. It's disheartening to see such perks vanish when the company is more prosperous than ever. It leaves employees feeling undervalued and disconnected from the company's overall success. In conclusion, working for this company has been a mixed experience. The presence of a good manager can make all the difference, but the prevailing micromanagement style, an overwhelming number of initiatives, and the loss of budget for partner meetings and in-office engagement have made the journey a challenging one. The company seems to be in transition, and it remains to be seen whether these changes will lead to a more positive work environment in the future."

Expedia Group,3,45182,"Great people, short-sighted management",Technical Writer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Seattle, WA",#NAME?,"Pay is lower than you would expect compared to other tech companies. I was never really given an honest-to-goodness onboarding experience, opting for a ""sink or swim"" approach where I was just immersed in the work and trusted to figure it out. As a result, I never learned basic things like ""how do I found out who to talk to about X?"", and was later chastised for not knowing these things when I hadn't been given any guidance. Expectations are often unclear; when I asked about criteria for promotion, I was provided a very vague skills matrix, but told that ""this is going to change soon, so don't get too hung up on it"". It was ""going to change soon"" for six months, and I never saw it change. I would often not find out that I had missed the mark somewhere or was not meeting an expectation until a month or more after the fact, which it is much harder to adjust and correct. When I raised to my manager that I felt some of these things were coming out of the blue, I was told ""we've been having these conversations consistently"" about topics that had literally never come up in any of our conversations. When I tried to raise this concern up the chain I was told ""well, communication is complicated"" and not given any assurances anything would be done about it after my departure. EG is pushing an absolutely non-sensical Return to Office policy: even if none of your teammates or none of the people who requisition work from your team are based in your location, you are still expected to come into the office 50% of the time. That 50% seems to be an entirely arbitrary number picked out of the air to please shareholders, not based in any kind of analysis or fact. This wouldn't be so bad if the office was actually a good place to work, but the office culture is severely lacking in organization or basic etiquette. Desks and chairs are ergonomically awful, with 80% of them facing directly toward exterior windows so glare is a constant issue. Desks are first-come first-serve during the day so if you don't arrive bright and early you are stuck with a non-adjustable desk that means you're uncomfortable all day long. Despite the existence of conference rooms and phone booths, people often take Zoom calls right from their desk, including two people at side by side desks jumping into the same Zoom call. This is a common occurrence because, as a global company, even if everyone on a team is in AN office, they won't be in the SAME office, so they're conducting all their business remotely anyway. The end result is doing the same work you do at home, in a less comfortable desk, with worse equipment, and more distractions. Of course, nobody wore a mask as of early 2023, and you would get weird looks in the halls for wearing one. Exceptions to the in-office policy are only given out for physical health reasons, and even then mostly only on a temporary basis. If you don't wish to come into the office for mental health reasons (to say nothing of the basic practicality as outlined above), the official company line is ""see a therapist and suck it up"". This is to say nothing of the fact that in October of 2022 they removed any kind of vaccination requirement to come into the office, so you can't even trust that the people around you are vaccinated against COVID. Leadership seems to be charging through all of this with oblivious aplomb. When the office first opened, Peter Kern released a message to employees telling them that it was option, and if anyone didn't want to come in for any reason (including ""You're just not comfortable doing it""), you would not be made to. At some point this message was quietly discarded, and the policy changed from 50% to ""50%, not counting Monday and Friday"". Eventually ""Expedia Weeks"" were instituted, where a week every quarter would require everyone to come in all five days. This resulted in chaos, long lines for all food and drink options, and special events that could not handle this capacity. No collaboration or increased productivity took place, but leadership smiled and insisted it was a success. Every candid conversation I had with a fellow employee made it clear that these policies are wildly unpopular with everyone except the highest level of management or those who have thoroughly drank the Kool-Aid. The result is an environment where I don't feel like my needs are taken into account whatsoever."

My demotion actually displaced me from product to operations and when I asked HR what my path back to PM would be (since this is what i was hired for, i was doing very well at it, and i also did not want to do operations) they told me i'd have to wait for another PM position to open and apply and interview like everyone else.

If you have a good manager it can be an amazing experience.,Do not believe what they are selling that they care about you as a person. Indeed only cares about one thing..money. The recent layoffs should be proof of that. For years I was under the belief they cared about employees mental health and then I started to see through it. If you have a bad quarter or two..then you are a liability to the company. Micro management is huge here and they make you hit stupid metrics even if you are pacing to hit your goal. Indeed only surfacely cares about their employees well being but deep down is just like every other corporation where profits are more important than people..and you know it. Yes you make good money here but I was miserable and management was disgusting and played favorites pretty clearly and it really impacts mental health. I make less elsewhere but am much more happy.

The culture right now is different from when I last worked (so I'm told) but historically has been very employee-centric. So much so that I found it to be a bit over the top in some situations. Salary is competitive, benefits are top notch, Indeed is looking for a certain class of employee. You need the at least the minimum experience level, a willingness to work as many hours as required to complete tasks on a deadline and some interview magic to have a shot here.  That's just to get you in, staying in means validating your quarterly of semi-annual performance with self-provided performance reviews.","The hours worked by myself (and my team) were somewhat astronomical. Weekends are the time you're either on-call or use the time to develop your skills, not watch Football or practice your putts on the course. It's a massive commitment being a part of Indeed operations teams.  Most of my coworkers handled this a lot better than I did, I think.

The director at Indeed is emotional and spreads her negativity to the people in the office.

Concentrix,1,45251,ASTOUNDING,L2 Technical Support Engineer,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Kuala Lumpur,"Honestly, none that anyone could think of except for - Trust the reviews

My tenure at Concentrix has been marked by a series of disappointments and frustrations that I feel compelled to share for the benefit of prospective employees.

From the outset, the lack of effective communication within the organization has been glaring. Important updates and information seem to vanish into thin air, leaving employees bewildered and hindered in their work. The absence of clear guidance from leadership only adds to the confusion, making it challenging to navigate daily tasks.

The company culture at Concentrix is regrettably uninspiring. Morale is notably low, and the atmosphere lacks the camaraderie and teamwork one would hope for in a professional setting. There's a palpable sense of indifference that permeates the workplace, making it difficult to feel motivated or engaged.

Technologically speaking, Concentrix falls short of contemporary standards. Outdated systems and tools hinder productivity rather than supporting it. It's perplexing to witness a company of this size and stature neglecting the importance of investing in modern technologies to streamline operations.

Equally concerning is the apparent disregard for employee well-being. The work-life balance is heavily skewed towards work, with minimal consideration for the personal lives and mental health of the workforce. It's disheartening to see a company overlook the fundamental need for a supportive and healthy work environment.

In summary, my experience at Concentrix has been far from satisfactory. I caution those contemplating employment with this company to weigh the potential drawbacks carefully. There are undoubtedly better opportunities available that prioritize employee satisfaction, professional growth, and a positive work culture.","Where do I even begin...

wfh is great
my team was the best","KPI to get monthly bonus in the hands of customers makes 0 sense. If they are unhappy about the resolution (that you give according to policy) they will give you 1 out of 5 and your VOC will drop drastically. 
You are told to start at 8 and go online, but when it's time to log off you have to do it 2 minutes after your log off time because ""we have to wait for the queue to be clear"". Imagine an incoming call that comes in those 2 minutes and you're on the phone for half an hour. That means if you had something else to do, like living the rest of your life, you're late, you can't. 
You can't take your 10 minutes personal time in the last hour of your shift for some unspecified reason, the breaks are tightly scheduled which for a job based on incoming calls is unthinkable. If your break is at 10 am, and you receive a call at 9.58 you have to wait for the call to end before taking your 15 minutes anyway. So what's the point of scheduling them?
Sometimes between 2 breaks there are 3.5/4 hours on an 8-hour shift. 
To progress in your career you have to stay in the same role for at least one year. Other factor for promotion is if you constantly get the bonus by reaching KPI. So if you're good on calls, you will be promoted off the calls."

Allowances: As I am working at home, they didn't give me transportation allowance.

Concentrix,2,45187,Please don't do it,Action Fraud Advisor,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",,My colleagues in my specific team are lovely!,"Please do not work here, its stress 24/7. You have to log your toilet breaks, they dock them from your wages. I have IBS and I now earn less then minimum wage. The calls are CONSTANT. You get 40 seconds between calls to finish what you were doing before getting thrown into a new call. The calls are the same. Its incredibly boring. I had to deal with a bomb threat- I was not trained on how to deal with this, just warned it might happen. I had to stay on the phone like a negotiator and got paid next to nothing for it. There's no chance of any bonus. They dangle a bonus infront of everyone and make it impossible to get. If you have excellent audits, they put the goal post further away, if you're sick at all you have no chance of getting it. The system they use for calls DOES NOT WORK. It's faulty, you can barely hear the callers or they can barely hear you. It's glitchy and horrible. They do not care about you. They just care that you are taking as many calls as possible perfectly. No paid sick leave, unpaid breaks, no work/home balance- they don't care if your calls take you an hour or 2 into over time but God forbid you aren't taking calls immediately when your shift starts (seriously, if you take 2 mins to set up the 100 apps and sites you need to have open to even work you get told off)"

So in short, there are none.","Micromanaging to the extreme, invasion of privacy, takes time off for bathroom or being off phones for even a second for any reason, no raises, paycuts, begs for donations for other employees making the same wage while the CEO pulls millions, terrible benefits, very expensive health insurance that doesn't cover anything, no communication, hard to get questions answered, no one fixes reported issues then makes those issues interfering with your job your problem, no room to be human,"

They promote a work life balance but do not apply it. The on boarding process for new hires at a satff level is deficient and yet they expect you to perform well.

The working hours were incorrect. 

We were only provided with a shift schedule week by week at the end of the week for one week only. It is impossible to plan your life without knowing your shifts.

No incentive structure, and we were simply told that our salary could be cut, even though KPI targets were never provided."

Strong Leadership","I've had the opportunity to work for Concentrix for 2 years, and overall, it has been a positive experience. The company fosters a collaborative and inclusive work environment, providing numerous opportunities for professional growth and skill development.

However, one area that I believe could use improvement is the process of pay increases. While I appreciate the transparency in communication from the management team, I have observed that the process of salary adjustments tends to be slower than industry averages. This delay has sometimes created challenges for employees looking to align their compensation with their evolving skill sets and contributions to the company.

I believe that a more agile approach to compensation reviews could further enhance employee satisfaction and motivation. I recommend that the company considers streamlining the pay adjustment process to ensure that it aligns more closely with the fast-paced and competitive nature of the industry.

Despite this concern, I remain optimistic about the company's commitment to employee welfare and look forward to witnessing continuous improvements in this area.""

This approach acknowledges the positive aspects of the company while constructively addressing the specific issue of slow pay increase processes. It provides feedback that can be valuable for both current and potential employees and emphasizes a desire for positive change rather than solely focusing on the negative aspects."

Great companies try to meet their employees' financial, mental, physical and emotional needs. As a result, employees are often more productive, satisfied and willing to stay at the company long term.
 If you’re the kind of person that thrives in a structured environment, Concentrix, may be your thing. Pros like Flexible work hours, Compensation and Professional Development.","The truth, though, is that many large companies don’t like to think outside the box. Concentrix is usually less open to change because they are risk-averse. While this caution helps maintain company stability (a pro), it does mean that large companies are slow to change. It can take forever to get things done thanks to the corporate structure, defined policies, and outlined procedures."

The first project I was on was spectacular, afterwards I was moved to a permanent position which I quit due to poor treatment from management.

Equinix offers ESPP and RSU's are typical. All the sales reps I have came in contact are great. Equinix does a great job at hiring the best sales people. In almost 9 years I never had one issue with any other coworker and quite a few have become lifetime long friends. Yearly sales kick off to Vegas is an awesome experience that Equinix puts in a lot of effort and money into. P-Club is also another amazing experience that Equinix puts a lot of thought an money into. Equinix is the best of the best when it comes to anything Data Center related and that why they can demand such premiums. Decent offices.,"Cons are- low compensation and based salary compared to most other similar roles at other big tech companies. Always changing the comp plan for the worst. Every year the comp plan is cut down and try to make it as complicated as possible. You will work harder and bring in more revenue but get paid less every year. There's a lot of guessing into how you will be paid and half the time the comps aren't paid correctly or have to wait months. Equinix in the last 2 years has really focus on commission pay outs and making sure they can claw back as much as possible. As a global company they have made cross selling with other regions difficult so they do not have to pay full comp if their are multiply reps involved which in a lot times multiply reps are needed! Also, for the last 2 years, Equinix seems to have really focus this effort and money on DEI. I am all for diversity but it's a point where it's in your face 24/7 now. Volunteering is being pushed harder every Q as it seems now it is more mandatory within the company. If you are comfortable in your AE position it looks down upon as you should aspire to be a manager or director one day. There a lot of great team managers and there are few who should not be managing a team. Equinix is huge on promoting within which is a huge pro but a lot times they will promote AE's to management level with no experience or training and seems to be based on how much they like you and not so much your performance. My former manager constantly canceled calls, was late and half the time was somewhere else (why her team was the worst performing). Equinix does not care about loyalty at all! No severance package for tenure reps that have been with Equinix for many years. It's a shame as Equinix was once a great place to work but the Cons now outweigh the Pros and they are chasing away great people.

HR, or as they call it, ERC department is just plain awful/useless. You're the bad guy if you make a complaint. ""We're going to offer you a generous amount of bereavement leave, but if you decide to use it we're going to treat you like some 💩 we just stepped in.""

Managers are basically allowed to do what they want, and are perfectly allowed to try and derail your career. They can put you in low standing with the company for no justifiable reason, and then even if you want to try and improve yourself, you are no longer allowed the resources to do that.

They also misreport your salary to HMRC so that they think you've been paid vast amounts more than they've paid you (i.e. they duplicate monthly entries), and when you email ERC to tell them, they ignore you and ghost you. Meanwhile, the tax man is taking a 4 figure number out your paycheque each month because they don't know any better.

And when you finally get hard evidence that you've been subject to constructive dismissal and open up a grievance with the company, they will ignore you and ghost you seemingly in the hope that you will go past the 3 month mark of you leaving, meaning you would be unable to go through an employment tribunal process."

X,5,45188,"Innovative and Collaborative, but Fast-Paced: My Journey at Twitter",Software Engineer,Former Employee,,Working at Twitter was an opportunity to be part of an organization that values innovation and encourages employees to think outside the box. The constant push to improve products and services was inspiring. Twitter takes diversity and inclusion seriously. The company's commitment to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment is evident in its policies and initiatives. I had the privilege of working with incredibly talented and passionate colleagues who were dedicated to their roles and always eager to collaborate on projects. Twitter's reach and impact on the world are undeniable. It's gratifying to work for a platform that connects people and enables conversations on a global scale. The fast-paced nature of the tech industry means there is always something new to learn. Twitter provided ample opportunities for professional growth and development.,"While the fast-paced environment can be invigorating, it can also be overwhelming at times. Keeping up with the rapid changes and demands of the industry can be challenging. Maintaining a healthy work-life balance can be a struggle, especially during crunch times and product launches. It's essential to set clear boundaries and prioritize self-care. Twitter sets high expectations for its employees, which can be both motivating and demanding. Meeting these expectations requires dedication and commitment. The tech industry is highly competitive, and staying ahead of the curve requires constant effort. This can sometimes lead to stress and a sense of urgency. The transition to remote work brought about by external factors had its share of challenges, including communication hurdles and feelings of isolation. However, Twitter made efforts to mitigate these issues."

Even if the commute is 3 hours, they won't give you flexibility. Any WFH goes straight to Elon for approval. They check your badge log. - No free food despite having to go into the office. There are meals you can buy for $5, but they might get rid of that soon. They give you granola bars, but you even have to pay for snacks. - Random Elon requests: You have to submit monthly reviews of what you do (big-brother style) and you'll never know if it's a layoff. He'll pander you for ideas to improve the company. - Chaos: Company is bleeding talent. Teams are stretched so thin so expect to take on 3-5x the workload of an average employee. Is there a process/policy that your team follows? Throw that out the door cause Elon doesn't follow them. You'll find out about any OKRs through his Twitter feed. - Shut up and do your work: Don't question or push back, just do as you're told or you can get fired. - Promotions are rare, they don't care about career development. The goal is for you to work so hard you burn out and leave, then they just hire new people. - The attitude is that you're privileged to work for Elon, so any compensation is stocks (worthless for the foreseeable future). - Want to travel to HQ? You can stay in a meeting room on one of the floors in the building. - BRG, ERG, WLB? Consider that not applicable when you sign the offer letter."

Elons lack of comms or expertise in social media, his inept management team who’ve never had an original thought in their lives (elon says this, elon says that) spouting absolute nonsense to tenured experts were embarrassing themselves at every turn. Personally I left a huge amount of $$$ on the table because I simply couldn’t bear to spend another minute with this bunch and I absolutely pity the remaining folks who unfortunately are mostly there to keep their visas or because they have financial obligation.

- Friendly colleagues 
- Great culture for the most part 
- Very relaxed; great work-life balance 
- Nice offices with the usual free food and snacks
- Good managers for the most part, but I got lucky","- The culture is maybe too relaxed. There are some very good people at Twitter, but also a lot who are just sitting around collecting paychecks. Was impossible to fire anyone even when they're severely underperforming.
- Not very performance oriented, though they're trying to change this. Promotions were mostly based on tenure. 
- Disorganized, with silos and no clear direction or urgency, and quite risk averse. As a result of this and the other cons I listed above, Twitter struggles to ship. 
- Kind of high-schoolish. Thankfully I never experienced any beer pong type stuff, but the company seems to celebrate a certain personality type (bombastic and extroverted) regardless of how good their work is. After seeing the same people on stage at company events over and over again, I concluded I was unlikely ever able to rise up to a leadership position here. 
- Leadership (staff and director level and up) needs to be more diverse. 
- Lots of splashy and boozy offsites, events, retreats, quarterly planning sessions, but not enough doing.

Initially people may be attracted by the research (or R&D) but soon realize that this is not a very productive research environment.
- If you group is controlled by manager who is completely incompetent, it will stifle all progress or research. Can't generalize this to all groups, but I have seen similar things happen more often than not.
- Senior management (essentially Roger) although nice, is practically useless. 
- Not much collaboration is going on.
- The culture is quite backwardish, for example, working on weekends is praised, it is apparently acceptable to scold or shame employees, long and useless meetings are held in which the manager (or occasionally Roger) talk endlessly.
- Not much (not any!) growth opportunities.
- Pay is not competitive for full-time employees."

It was surprising how many of the senior level executives turned a blind eye to gross misuse of company money.  Some of the major boondoggles were beyond the pale.  Flying 1st class on company money and hosting party meals for dozens of friends is not in itelf a bad thing.

NEC Corporation,2,41741,"Better stay away, or you will regret.",Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,,"Relaxed environment, flexible schedule, quiet place to think about things.","It's not that this place is so bad; it's the opportunity you will be missing that will cost you.

(This review is based on my personal experience in a particular group. I don't think every group is the same. So ask, observe, and do your research about a group.)

First of all, this place is called a ""research"" lab, but it's barely one. Some people, when they decide to forget about financial gains (will come back to this later) and join a research lab, want to publish papers and build up an academic profile. If you are one of those people, think twice about joining this place, especially some groups. Look at if any of the recent departures from the group went to a place you'd like to be. If the odds is against you, there is probably a good reason there. You may be different, but you will still be constrained by the lab. You will probably get much less ""research"" and much more ""development"" than you thought. ""Freedom of research"" is more often just used to entice you to join; after you join, you will likely be assigned something your manager tell you ""very critical"" for the company and you have to do it. For those who really wants to do academic research, it's much better to find a postdoc position with a great mentor. I know, you will sacrifice a little financially, but the long term gain will be worthwhile. Plus, you are not going up too much anyway.

Secondly, your direct manager's power is pervasive and democracy is non-existent. Of course the org is flat and on top of your manager there is Roger (president, who is kind and approachable, by the way). What this means is that, managers have no chance to move up in the company, because they can't replace Roger. When you get no chance to go up in a company, what would you do? You think about next opportunity, and you don't think about taking a long-term view in managing and helping your reports. Some manager chose to use everything they could to get things for themselves in preparation for a future job jump, and some times this is at the expense of what could help researchers. When your manager takes a very short-term view to maximize his gain, that's bad news for you. What makes it worse is, your manager decides everything, literally everything, from what you should work on on a weekly basis, what intern you may get in the summer (if you get one), what's your performance review and bonus, and who you should put on your paper (Of course, manager gets to be on almost every paper, regardless of how little he does for that paper.) This kind of massive power on a manager can easily produce dictators. In the meetings, generally people are obedient towards the manager, rather than actively voicing their opinions. It's sad.

Now let's come to compensation. Japanese companies generally don't believe in giving out equity (stocks) to employees. It's a fact that, in the bay area, you can't live on wages alone. Houses can easily go 1.x million if you want to be in a reasonable area (with good elementary schools and close to where you work). This is a very realistic problem if you want to have a life here. Don't forget that you will not get what you are offered - it's taxed much higher than when you were at school so you will get about close to half of that amount. Think about how long you will be able to get your down payment for a house and pay back the debt. Compare that with upstart American companies. It's very easy to find such information from friends or online. Realistically think about your livelihood and think if it's going to be worthwhile to make half of what you could make for a few papers that you may or may not get to publish.

Some people chose to join this place to get a green card because NEC applies for it for you right after you start. This is totally unnecessary. With your papers and PhD degree, you will get an EB1 green card almost anywhere you go in a few months. The cost totally outweigh the gain.

And finally, you want to be working in a place that you are proud of. Consider if this is going to be that place. If you are the kind of people who want to get a ""wow!"" when you tell people where you work, you'll be disappointed if you join this place."

Inside the marketing cocoon, you notice nothing, but once you step out of it the problems become more apparent. Lately with the rapid expansion following the public listing and the consequent layoffs, the company seems to have lost its way.

It's said that actions speak louder than words, and thoughtworks's actions do not align with their so called values.

-being a consultancy (more outsourcing for the Romanian branch), they depend on projects. They hire you without knowing for sure if they actually have a suitable project for you or if their client accepts you on the project. This creates a large pool of people on the ""bench"", where you have to wait (in some cases months) and maybe contribute to some internal initiatives. If there are no projects or if clients do not accept you on the projects...guess what happens? ...exactly: you are laid off...and if you are ""lucky"" they lay you off with 1 week before probation period ends, to give you ""a lot"" of time to search for a new opportunity. Saddest part is, the management is aware that this might happen when they hire you! They basically exploit the law in their favor. This happened not only to me but to other colleagues, some of which came from very solid companies, some changed careers, trusting the Thoughtworks brand behind this company.

Overall, probably the worst experience you can have in your career."

Also, you might get a lot of visibility if you like to give talks and promote passionately any tech topic, as the company is hungry to have any new ways to differentiate from the competitors.","After going public, Thoughtworks it's just another consultancy company, really far away from the premium partner once it was. The limits of not working with customers related to gambling or countries that doesn't respect human rights are fading really fast, and day by day, the employees are becoming more like numbers to rent no matter what, so the company earnings increases as much as possible. Maybe a more relaxed company than other consultancies, but also paying way below the market. The founder's idea of the company it's now just a facade while most of the talent is moving on because of the low salaries, weird behaviours agains what we are supposed to represent, layoffs and organisational changes."

Also, some Social Change initiatives the company is doing are actually great.","This used to be a great place to work, with amazing culture and values, a respect for employees and minorities, and an extra care for good practices. Since we went publicly available, everything went off.

Values and culture are not respected anymore, we don't provide any value to our clients, we just lend workforce like any other consultancy firm in the world. On top of that, the management does practically nothing; almost all of the bureaucracy, client management, etc. has to be done by the folks that are also doing the actual work.

Not only that, but we sell workers to the clients in a category that we are not really in (like eg. selling a consultant as a senior), adding even more burden to our pour souls.

I can understand that in some cases you have to perform over your current grade to show that you can be switched to the next one, but they also have changed the performance review system to make it more about micromanagement than anything else.

If all of these wasn't enough, salaries have been frozen for +2 years with no perspective to be updated. Same with salary bands.

When it comes to work and life balance, they are clearly pushing to remove remote work, but this is a problem because lots of us don't live even close to the offices. So how the company is solving this ""issue""? They are making work conditions worst to force employees to leave and hire new ones with new contracts.

They also moved from country based decision making to whole Europe based decision making. The reasoning was (amongst others) to share brilliant minds accross the continent. The reality is they are letting people go from most expensive european countries and hiring them in the affordable ones.

We also used to be an environmental friendly company, but not anymore. We changed from a sustainable business to an indefinite growing model, and we now support technologies like GenAI, which are a fraud and VERY bad for the environment, without anyone even questioning any of it.

Thoughtworks is now not even a shade of what it was."

Those values were gone ages ago and the hiring bar has not been the same anymore for several years. They are just a glorified consultancy just as many other large consultancy companies out there. The Australian region is the worst-performing region across the globe. The leaders in the Australian region are awful and have no real engineering background (some of them were software testers) and have grown as in most consultancy companies with sheer internal connections. Most people with sales and good communication skills have gone up the ranks and they've pulled up people similar to them to form a mutual benefit society. Even during redundancies, this company was so unethical that they made the least connected (not performing) people within the organization redundant first.

Way too much time is spent on the weekly all-company meeting ""Asakai"" on these topics. It is sometimes useful and often is a total waste of time. Please I just need to know how the company is doing financially, and get back to do my work. Information is very siloized. One big reason is because everyone still spends most of their time WFH, at least on the engineering side. Oh, sure, we are all supposed to come to work 3 days a week, but this is not enforced at all. A natural consequence is the rank-and-file seldom talks to their peers and only the managers know what's going on. This is great of you are one of those people who just likes to take orders and march, but it makes a very frustrating experience if you want to have a say on what you are doing and decide whether you are doing the right thing for the company. If you have been in the company for a long time, you will be fine, because you know who to talk to and where to find stuff, but if you are new, you'd better be extra-motivated."

Rakuten,5,43778,Fantastic so far!,Android Engineer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Beloit, WI","I just started a few weeks ago, but so far I'm loving the place. I'm at the Beloit office. I live a good distance away, so they let me work from home twice a week, which is very nice. 

But I actually don't mind driving the ~60 miles to the office most days, since it's pretty great to be there. Everyone there is super nice. And they have food - so much food!

When I'm in the office, I eat breakfast and lunch there, on the house. They cater lunches and post the next week's menu at the end of each week. And they basically have a fully-stocked kitchen. Tons and tons of snacks (dispensers with M&Ms and cashews all over the office). A full soda fountain with Coke and Pepsi products. And even a kegerator with a rotating batch of beer and hard cider. All just there for you to have whenever you want. All they ask is that you don't bring any of it home with you, which is totally reasonable.

As far as the work goes, most of my team is actually in California, so there's lots of video calls. I'm working on a large and complex piece of software now, but I came from a tiny dev shop before this, so the transition hasn't been without challenges for me. But the team has been super accommodating of that, and I really appreciate it.","Beloit isn't the best location to have an office; the Madison area would be far better. But much of their workforce at that office lives in Illinois, so it's totally understandable.

Can't think of much more than that for now, but I'm pretty new still. Will definitely update if things change in the future."
Rakuten,3,41681,Good place to learn and move on,Category Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Aliso Viejo, CA","Caveat: I was there before and after the acquisition of Buy.com by Rakuten.
Good learning opportunity. In my time there, I was able to learn a lot about how ecommerce sites operate, including managing manufacturer and merchant partnerships.
Decent perks. Company used to provide lunch everyday, and then it became twice a week (not sure what it is anymore). They would also have an In N Out truck that came out once a month, which was nice.
Nice people. For the most part, people are nice and genuine.","Lack of/Bad Direction. The CEO of the parent company, HIroshi Mikitani, is busy running a global company, of which Buy.com is a very small part. He seems to determine major strategy decisions based on a couple of his ""liaisons"" stationed in the company. Being on the front lines, there seemed to be a disconnect between ""Mickey's"" decisions and the actual US Market (Yes, Mr. MIkitani actually prefers to be addressed as ""Mickey"")
Weird culture. The company is a mix of OC culture (pretty fair on work/life balance) and Japanese culture (late hours, put in your face-time, don't leave til your boss leaves, etc). It partially depends on which group you're in.
Business is tough. Buy.com doesn't have much a differentiation from Amazon (1st party business) and eBay (marketplace business), and they definitely don't do either as well as the other guys. It's a difficult market to compete in.
Lots of turnover. Plenty of people moving on to greener pastures. If you stick around long enough, and have some talent/skill, you got a good chance of progressing. There's some politicking involved, but probably not more than the average company of similar size."

The Japanese influence is there and both interesting and entertaining. The company as a whole has potential.,"This is where it all starts. Buy.com rebranded to Rakuten.com back in early 2013. Until mid 2014, issues regarding the rebranding still existed. Both consumers and businesses are not open to the change or the name. How does this translate to the work environment? More stress for everyone. Numbers that go up and down. Small teams that desperately need more people are unable to handle the influx of merchant demand. Sales has a harder time pitching. A number of top management left (albeit not due to issues but for their own personal reasons). This left more aggressive, and now-focused (as opposed to future focused) management in place.

I feel like if you are ""buddies"" with the director, you basically get away with anything and you tend to get handed more projects/opportunities because of this. 

Bringing up issues with your supervisor tend to be overlooked a lot. Nothing ever seems to get resolved as far as a better incentive program or making the employees feel more valued/respected. 

The system they have as far as quota is jacked because some supervisors put agents on projects which can make their numbers higher or they have another agent helping with training (making your numbers lower) yet you're expected to still make the same exact quota as an agent who had been working without interruptions their entire shift. They say it's been taken into consideration but it's not because you still get it reported without notes in your QR."

The environment at Ebates is very relaxing, welcoming, and friendly. The office has an open floor plan, which makes it easy to build rapport with your supervisors and people of higher authority.

Leadership isn't very receptive to feedback and communication is oftentimes poor. There's miscommunication between Japan and US that obstructs business progress in the Americas. Things can change very fast, simply based off of a unilateral decision-making process. 

Employees have no drive and motivation to work hard, because the company is lacking in strong leadership to provide employees with a cohesive vision to fight for. People come in late and leave early all the time.

Red Hat talks about the importance of understanding associate interests, passions and career aspirations in facilitating associate career growth, but they don't walk the talk - including at the highest levels of the People team."
Red Hat,4,45090,"Great Colleagues, Good Work, Mixed Vision",Developer Advocate,Current Employee,,"Most reviews mention the same pros, but I guess I’ll repeat them. The WLB and work culture is pretty great. You get to work with interesting technology and many great people. Honestly, the pay and benefits are pretty good. RSU allocation could be higher. Given the WLB it’s not bad in my opinion, it’s just not as high as some peers. People putting in the extra effort generally get more RSUs to my knowledge, and do get raises.","Some teams and people complain of poor compensation, lack of raises, and RSUs. Lots of people at Red Hat were able to coast and got stuck in old ways. There was a huge bias towards enterprise Java and on-premise until recently. Sure, it’s a large part of the market and core business but it left Red Hat looking like Old Hat. There’s a lot of process at times. All big companies probably get this way, but it’s frustrating when simple or important tasks can take weeks to finish. Leadership has felt directionless for a while, though they are improving. Recent layoffs were handled poorly; some high value people/initiatives were mistakenly affected and morale took a hit."
Red Hat,5,42442,Great company but slowly losing its culture,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,"- passionate people and fantastic culture
- great environment to learn and pursue your dreams
- big company but feels like a start-up; very nimble","Frank Calderoni, the new CFO, is changing the culture for the worse. He is bloating management layers and switching the mindset to a big/ bureaucratic culture. Everything to him is a number, including people.  His steady push to layoff people in the US and hire in low cost regions is negatively affecting employee morale.  The company currently has positive momentum so it will continue doing well in the market but the effects of Frank's decisions may come to haunt the company soon."

Red Hat,3,45187,"Mileage will vary, but beware",Product Sales Specialist,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,#NAME?,"This is a sale oriented review, so it likely isn't relevant to other areas. I personally would not recommend working at Red Hat. The culture has severely degraded and while OpenShift and Ansible are very good solutions, they do not justify the premium IBM is driving from Red Hat in order to recoup their $34B investment. Red Hat is on a negative trajectory, and although IBM is buying time to turn it around, it's not a pleasant place to be right now. OTEs have become largely unobtainable except for the very few top accounts. Everyone else is looking at a multi-year cadence of hitting less than 50% of quota, with some only achieving single digits. For a 50/50 plan, that just isn't acceptable and nearly everyone I've talked to is actively looking for a new gig. Management is in self-preservation mode distancing themselves as much as they can from the underperforming regions/accounts. This means a PIP culture has started and those with the short straw are being left with no real alternative than to leave...regardless of their overall abilities. Be aware that the comp plan is rumored to be changing significantly in 2024, and no one seems very clear as to how it will impact sales people. Ask some good questions if you are interviewing. I also have found that Red Hat on my resume is to not a positive attribute. The Red Hat reputation as a 'legacy brand' along with the IBM association isn't very interesting to most hiring managers..at least, not in sales."

This year because quotas are so high, there aren't sales funnels to support it so new oversight policies are in place that look to be only there to permit terminations without question.

- We pay market rate for our CEO and Presidents, VP. As for engineers not being paid a market rate, they need to understand that this is a insurance company. If you are not involved in sales, you can be expected to be paid admin rate. 
- SMRT, ComfortDelgro are coming near to our competitive insurance package, but we are still ahead of them in the race pack.","- Not really a con. Company says that going for courses is considered 'urgent' request. This means that you are recommended to stay irrelevant and staying status quo is the best course of action to tide through covid period. Training courses doesnt add any value to your current job, and it only increases chances of job hopping and covid infection risks. The only course your company will recommend you is the defence masters course. This course will allow them to keep the image of being relevant in the defence industry, while also ensuring that engineers and managers will be flooded with irrelevant skillsets to prevent job hopping. 
- Most retired civil servants are forced to lead double lives as IT project managers. Alot of them struggle to understand software terminologies and software development cycles. Most of them struggle with their double lives and sometimes the lack of armor vehicles and aircrafts in a software house does make them look out of place. Sometimes, additional project engineers need to be hired to do the job of these IT project managers, which is a grave insult to the capabilities of these managers. It is equivalent to telling them that they can lead a battalion in war, but needs a clerk to front the war for them. ST needs to gives ample opportunities for them to learn on the job."

Strange large crossover in comp for people at varying levels of seniority. Huge cluster of people at 'Senior consultant' level who seem overqualified given years of experience. Line management always in favour of client whether or not client requests are reasonable or not. Perhaps down to the nature of the business being driven by money available through large managed service contracts and independent day rate engagements. Teams sometimes carried by one or two more senior devs who are expected to cover for large numbers of juniors advertised to client as stronger than they are which seems unfair. Presumably comes down to budgets and keeping overheads lower for the business if the client bid has not provided enough capital.

2. Pay is not great & definitely not in line with industry standards. There can also be wild differences in pay levels for people within the same role.
3. Flagging point 1 to management, the offer of support is very minimal, especially considering that many of my predecessors had flagged to them the same issue.
4. Some of the tasks in my job I expected, some I did not. It should have rung alarm bells when (before the interview stage) I was told there was no JD for the role.
5. Bonuses are awful. A £40 voucher? Which we were asked (voluntarily) to contribute towards our Xmas party? Also the Xmas party & Xmas Dinner you have to pay for to participate in... WHAT? I've never ever had that at any company I've worked at. There's normally a budget for the company to throw an Xmas celebration for its staff!

Employees that have been there 2-3 years or more are given extreme work loads, handling accounts across 2 or 3 different teams. Since the company sells 50+ products, the learning curve is more than a year so tenured account managers are the only ones that understand the ins and outs of the products and are given all of the work. 

The extreme work load coupled with technology that often breaks (launching products across 4 or more different systems) means that advertising clients are often upset and escalating to sales. Account Managers are then yelled at by clients and then again internally by the middle sales managers. It's very stressful.

No path to success and if you point this out with data or facts you’re putting your job in jeopardy.

Career opportunities? Mirage: Promotions are rare, and growth feels limited. Management talks a big game about career development, but it rarely translates into reality.

Burnout on the horizon: The workload is demanding, with constantly increasing expectations and tight deadlines. Work-life balance is more of a slogan than a reality.

Leadership disconnect: Upper management seems out of touch with the daily grind, focusing more on optics and growth figures than employee well-being.


Example 1: Culture Clash and Stagnation
Headline: All that glitters is not gold: A disillusioned year at Zendesk

Pros: Great office perks, decent starting salary, some talented colleagues.

Cons:

Culture gone stale: The ""fun"" startup vibe quickly fades into micromanagement and metrics obsession. Creativity and initiative are discouraged, replaced by rigid processes and KPIs.
Career opportunities? Mirage: Promotions are rare, and growth feels limited. Management talks a big game about career development, but it rarely translates into reality.
Burnout on the horizon: The workload is demanding, with constantly increasing expectations and tight deadlines. Work-life balance is more of a slogan than a reality.
Leadership disconnect: Upper management seems out of touch with the daily grind, focusing more on optics and growth figures than employee well-being.

Overall, I came to Zendesk excited about the culture and potential. However, my experience was defined by disillusionment, stagnation, and a constant undercurrent of stress. Unless you thrive in a high-pressure, metrics-driven environment with limited growth opportunities, steer clear."
Zendesk,2,45164,Can only recommend if you're starting your career in tech,Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","San Francisco, CA",Good work life balance for some teams (others work 10+hours a day) Good healthcare plan,"Leadership is weak and incompetent across the board (this isn't an exaggeration) as most are only in their position either because of contacts, politics or simply sticking around for 5+ years as others with actual talent move on to better opportunities. Company lacks clear direction and leadership likes to talk in circles without saying anything at all while dismissing genuine concerns voiced by numerous employees over the last year. Some departments have downright toxic leadership (see current sexual harassment lawsuit); the company may also be engaged in some other questionable activities (can't confirm but there are rumblings). Pay for some employees is well below industry standard and with RSUs gone there's no meaningful way to make up for the lower TC. Top talent has been leaving in droves at all levels and with the company now operating in post PE mode (i.e. cost-cutting) replacing them is unlikely as talented people aren't generally willing to work for low pay. The culture that made the company popular for many years is all but dead and gone now and only getting worse with each passing month."

The board went right along with these polarizing collections of buzzwords that ultimately cost us everything. This culminated in a battle to sell the company that was heavily politicized internally. Ultimately he declined a fair offer, our shares lost half their value in a few months. That left us with a fire sale offer from bloodless Private Equity stakeholders. We were lucky to get half the peak value of our remaining shares. The first and continuing order of business has been to reduce the payrolls. This started with layoffs in November 2022. Like a few hundred others, this was my last day. The weekend before, they leaked the plans with an early filing in accordance with the WARN act. Presumably this was an effort to demoralize more into quitting. Hundreds of long-time employees in good standing were fired in order to signal to PE that we're a real, super-serious company now.

There's opportunity if you want it.","The core values of the company have changed since the acquisition took place in January 2023. Countless C and E level employees have left in the last year as a result of going private. Mass exodus. The management that remains is inexperienced, the product doesn't seem to have as good a reputation as it did, and several benefits that made working here fantastic have been pulled and nothing has been done to make up for things like no inflationary increase in salary this year, no bonus opportunities to earn more in friendly sales competitions, no longer receiving stocks or equity in the company since its now private and the core progressive values instilled by Mikkel and so many amazing people have evaporated. I could list a dozen other negative changes, but I digress. This is no longer a progressive ""employees first"" company. Its a corporation who will hold the lowest employees responsible for the organizations failures. PS There are no opportunities to advance in sales like there used to be. Massive layoffs mean no open positions. They're downsizing to save on costs. Many of us have been waiting well over a year to move up (the one's who have earned it) and there are no opportunities internally. There's also no sympathy about this from management. We were literally told to ""get off the boat if you don't want to be a part of this rocky journey,"" after the acquisition went through."

- They take digital first seriously. They are actively improving flexible work options. Its great to know I'm at a place that won't force people to work in a fixed location.

Zendesk,2,44936,A mess...,Sales Representative,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",,There are some genuinely decent and talent people amidst the sea of the passive aggressive and pass-the-buck sorts.,"So. Very. Many. Deals over 1K are considered ""strategic"" on an enterprise team. The company uses a competitor CRM internally as their own offering isn't competitive. Management reaching out for long conversations and requests to do work on days off. It's a bureaucratic nightmare to get anything done. The pricing model is ridiculous and unsustainable. Even the CEO skipped town. While there are decent people here, far too many people speak out of both sides of their mouth, and that includes senior leadership. The go-to-market strategy hasn't evolved to meet where the market is today. Alot of inflated egos. Alot of highly anxious, fear-based behaviors. Too much insincere, passive-aggressive (and sometimes just aggressive) behaviors. Claims to be diverse and welcoming, but also lost a class action suit due to unfair treatment of protected classes. Every company has problem areas where they could do better, but Zendesk stacks alot of issues with very positives to offset the nonsense."

Absolutely zero transparency since the new leadership team took over in 2022. They will overwork you to the bone again and again. Managers tell you to set boundaries, but then do not lead by example because they are scared of their own managers and leadership.

Zendesk,2,45083,Treasure turned to trash,Account Executive,Current Employee,,- Flexible work environment -- 100% remote for those 50+ miles away from any office location. - They leave you alone if you perform well. - PTO for sales is 21 days + you get 11 or 12 paid holidays. - Product has great brand recognition.,"- Sold to private equity firms in November 2022 and they've turned what was once a treasure of a company into trash and a stress pit. - They sneakily cut GTM's commission structures so you have to hit around 150% of your quota or more on average to hit OTE. They bamboozled everyone into thinking the new commission structure was going to make them MORE money but if you read the actual ICP, it's the complete opposite. Sales leadership didn't even understand the new ICP and how it affected them even until it was brought to their attention by concerned AEs. Nothings changed though but supposedly now that leadership knows they're affected by it too they're pushing for change. TBD but not hopeful. - The culture is going way downhill. It used to be AMAZING but now everyone is extremely stressed all the time and overworked. - There's no work-life balance anymore. - The PE firm have also made what was promised last year from the old ownership to be a 100% flexible WFH if you want environment to forcing anyone who lives within a 50 mile radius of an office to go back to the office at least twice a week. 50 miles is A LOT and to be forced to do so after years of WFH and being able to enjoy life more is horrible in my mind. -- It's easy for executive leadership to force return to offices when they have the money to pay for their childcare. What about the people who can't? I'm glad I live far more than 50 miles way from an office because everyone I know who has been forced back at Zendesk is not happy about it. Office work isn't the way for millennials and gen Z and wasting life commuting and having your mental health affected being forced to go back to a physical office isn't the new way of life anymore. - All departments are so disconnected from one another and the processes they have in place conflict with another department's -- so there's no true REAL process. It's extremely cumbersome and has only gotten worse with the new PE firm takeover. - Unvested RSUs were cut by 50+% for pay out with the new ownership came in. Went from 30k to just 12k. - The PE firm took away a CRUCIAL benefit for employees when they took over -- Recharge Fridays where we got half days every Friday. Now it's one Friday per QUARTER. - PE firm took away personal development funds as well. - I know there are other cons I just can't think of right now."

Priorities are misaligned with the business. Managers pressure ICs to find a way to promotion without any real path actually existing. - Most middle managers are promoted from IC roles and don’t know what good management looks like, and are given no training. - Least amount of task visibility or project organization of any company I’ve worked for; Leads to lack of shared sense of accomplishment and siloing of work. - Company recently switched to a top-down decision-making strategy (I.e., waterfall), so engineers are even more siloed and have fewer opportunities for visibility & collaboration.

Luxoft,4,45301,Great Place to Work,Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Turin,"The company has a very deep and positive culture. The management is composed by young and open-minded people. The office in Italy is composed by people coming from all over the world and there are a lot of vertical growth opportunities given that the office has been recently opened and the company is hiring a lot.
Another very good point is the flexibility of the work. For the majority of the roles it is possible to work from home 80% of the time and there are also some roles that allow the full-remote contract (without impacting the salary).
In general as an employee you feel trusted and your ideas are always taken into account by your managers.
Work-Life balance is very good, I never felt too much stress and I was always able to take my vacations whenever I needed them. Quality of the results is more important than the time spent at work.

Usually you get the feedback like it's a crisis in the company and in the world, so you should wait and perhaps in the future the raise will be accepted. The management doesn't give you any terms and the communication is unclear, in the best case the bonus will be assigned to you(usually 2-5 percent of year salary).
The situation can be completely changed if you have an offer from another company and you are really an experienced developer or a ""star"" in this case the management will find the money to do a counteroffer...
2) Management doesn't care about your personal development, and it doesn't care about giving you a project road map or smth like that. Usually it looks as if you just do some routine job and it's okey for everybody. The less questions you have the better it is."

Since joining Amadeus, HR and senior management have whittled away at what benefits, compensation, and a productive, fun working structure our unit had. I have witnessed many employees’ lives be disrupted by poor compensation offers or adjustments based on outdated market data averages that don’t appreciate real-life cost of living circumstances. My closest colleagues face ongoing stress in their personal lives due to poor compensation and minimal benefits that are an insult to high-performers. There are many employees who receive compensation above their tier’s salary band, though others are told that they cannot earn more due to such bands presenting a limit. What hypocrisy! Many benefits that we were told would be maintained, such as professional talk therapy coverage, have been eliminated (this should tell you what they think about employee wellbeing). As an expert recruiter would know, an ambitious employee should be promoted every 12-18 months, though we are not permitted to be considered for promotion before 24 months- effectively meaning that career progression is slothful. Which few people I have seen promoted in the last 24 months from our business group have strictly been white males while folks of other demographics have proven their worthiness for recognition and reward."

Managers don't care about employees health they just want to get the work out of employees. It is a bad idea to join Amadeus if you are seeking for work life balance( unfortunately nobody talks about it). In the name of facilities HR gives cult membership to 70/3000 employees which comes around 2% of total employees in Bangalore office. Unfortunately every other employee (at least in my team and few teams I know) is overloaded with a lot of work.

Due to finances, they've stopped 401k matching, semi-annual bonuses, and no Annual Compensation Review for the past year.

As a remote worker, you have the opportunity to work alongside and learn from professionals from diverse backgrounds, which can broaden your perspective and enrich your skill set. Flexible Work Schedule: Remote work often allows for more flexibility in terms of when and where you work. This can lead to a better work-life balance, allowing you to tailor your work hours to your personal preferences and needs. Reduced Commute: One of the most obvious benefits of remote work is the elimination of a daily commute. This can save you both time and money, reduce stress, and contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle. Cost Savings: Remote workers typically save money on commuting, work attire, and dining out. You might also benefit from lower living costs if you choose to live in a more affordable location. Increased Productivity: Some people find that they are more productive when working remotely because they can create a workspace that suits their needs and preferences. Fewer distractions from colleagues can also contribute to increased productivity. Improved Work-Life Balance: Remote work can make it easier to balance your professional and personal life. You can schedule breaks to spend time with family or take care of personal errands, leading to a better overall quality of life.",No saving fund at the end

If you are in that circle, you will have a good roles, get promotions. Reward far exceed efforts. If you are not in the circle, you can work 16 hours a day, so real meaningful works, yet, get a pad on the shoulder only. And worst, get more assignments because they know you can get things done.

They said they want to be there and support customers/partners when they need us, but in reality, the company just don't hire enough people and many times working us to death. We're left to contemplate quitting our job every single day.
- Another is that now the management limits PTO quota per day and everyone is fighting to book a day off. Can you imagine how ridiculous it is to plan your PTO 5-6 months in advance?
- Townhalls never contribute to anything useful, to say the least, just a show for higher ups to dodge questions and make excuses about employee complaints.
- Often, it feels like call center employees are treated with double standard compared to other departments, we are informed to stay picking up calls while the others get to participate and enjoy company activities. If you're lucky you might get to join one, but only after your shift ends, that is.

At the same time, it's still run like a startup: opportunities abound, there are no rigid boundaries of responsibilities, and you can have a significant impact on almost any part of the business you find interesting.","Growing pains as deliveroo grows from a scrappy startup to a large enterprise.

- Very diverse and international teams
- Some job flexibility. I've seen people move internally every 1-2 years to very different roles, but now it's much harder with new processes.","- Benefits have decreased over the past 2 years. No more equity for middle managers and junior level employees (L6 and below). 
- 2 redundancies over the past couple of years (one in 2020 and another in 2023).
- High expectations and workloads with low salaries. Over the past year, workloads have increased due to people leaving combined with redundancies, but roles are rarely backfilled. That workload is shifted to existing employees now. Roles and responsibilities of every level have increased, while salary bands have decreased. 
- Very few promotions this year, and salary increases are very minimal and not worth the increased expectations.
- High turnover. I think average turnover is around 1 year. 
- Return to office 3 days a week, mandatory
- Too much change. Every few months there is an org change, so it's difficult to understand long term direction and growth of the company.
- Lack of empathy from Leadership. The expectation is you work hard even if redundancies have happened, salary increases are minimal and morale is low."

- Lack of diversity in management
- Leadership mainly comes from consultancy backgrounds
- Death by documents. Very heavy on PRDs, TDDs and in general “2-pagers”
- Because of the focus on documentation, the company is incredibly slow
- The company has no culture or whatsoever 
- High attrition

I enjoy it loads!,"After their second round of standard tech redundancies they ended up having to rehire plenty people anyway. Ever since the pace of development has slowed to a snails pace, innovation is stifled and Deliveroo will end up falling behind. 

Now they are refusing to give promotions to the majority of people in the latest performance review, likely hoping people will quit so they won't have to pay redundancies. All that is going to happen is we will loose the best people and they will end up having to spend more money hiring and training new people to take their place. All a waste in the name of saving money. Add to this the decision to return to the office 3 days a week, while not returning any of the pre covid office benefits like snacks or free lunches, it seems like the employees are undervalued."
Deliveroo,2,45323,Going steadily downhill,Data Scientist,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"Not much micromanaging.

Variety of work.

Good culture among colleagues.","Lack of job security.

Every few months, the company implements some new policy to worsen working conditions (e.g. no longer awarding stock options to any but the most senior staff, forcing people back into the office, redundancies, implementing new metrics for tracking productivity).

The company does not consider employee feedback when making decisions.

Staffing crises caused by the company trying to outsource new hiring overseas, meaning that when people leave, they are very slow to be replaced."

Blame is aimed at everyone except where it should sit, which is with the leadership team. Leadership is dreadful, petty and separates the team into “likes” or not, treating people accordingly. Atmosphere and morale is poor, and work is not great - determined by MBAs other parts of the business who don’t know what they are doing.

Deliveroo,1,45303,Toxic workplace,Finance Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","London, England",#NAME?,"CULTURE: 
- Toxic culture displayed at every level, from CEO shouting and swearing at staff infront of a full office, to undermining and aggressive communications during meetings to all levels of employees. 
- Lack of transparency from senior leadership and constant change in direction. 
- Zero work life balance. You’re expected to be available at all hours, not just via Slack but also on calls. Funny looks if you leave the office before 7pm, often have to declare your reason for leaving ‘early’.
- Finance team is not diverse, by this I do not mean demographics however work experience. Predominantly ex consultant, ex big four, resulting in project based way of thinking rather than coordinated and controlled finance process. 
- Competition rather than collaboration. 

WORKLOAD
- Obsession with ‘docs’, I.e, writing 30 page word documents akin to your university dissertation - full prose and storytelling rather than assimilating important information into a few slides. 
- After writing your 30 page document, you then sit in meeting rooms in silence, for up to an hour, while people read it and tag comments instead of discussing and making decisions. 
- Constant redundancies and refusal to backfill has led to remaining employees working 2-3, sometimes even 4 FTE’s worth of workload. 
- Poor processes and systems (Google sheets to make all decisions…) mean even simple tasks take hours, further accelerating the workload issues. 
- Paralysis by analysis. It’s rare a decision can just simply be made without consulting 10 or more different stakeholders and it is not clear who has accountability. 
- Obsession with annual planning. It derails BAU work. ‘Planning for Planning’ starts as early as June/July, followed by a chaotic 4/5 months as budgeting actually commences. In January, strategy will pivot, budget is declared unviable and focus moves to a reforecast resulting in a feeling of 6 months of wasted work. 

ONBOARDING
- You will not have one. 
- People will not offer to help you learn to use key systems and it’s very difficult to figure out who to ask. 

LEVELLING 
- Odd structure. It appears that most people are in more junior positions than they would be at comparable companies. Contributes to aggressive and competitive culture. 

PAY 
- Salary is average. 
- Benefits are poor; pension has a very low contribution from Deliveroo."

Even though I received regularly good performance reviews for years whilst I worked here, the assessment process isn't very transparent. It became transparent the longer I stayed here that leadership have no clue what they are doing and keep shifting goals and priorities with poor communication across the business - Will Shu really should pass the business on to someone with more business acumen, as he is out of his depth. The company showed little respect for staff throughout both rounds of redundancies (I was there for both), including the CEO Will, where on the day hundreds of employees were being let go he was sharing content about other things around the business with no consideration for how everyone around the company was feeling. I would not recommend working here if you want to be respected individually rather than your output, I personally stayed for as long as I did as it provided job security and salary throughout the pandemic as the business boomed."

There exists a significant potential for exponential expansion if one is able to speak tamil and adhere unquestioningly to the directives of the boss and his favorites.,"I concur with the recent review and have observed multiple instances during my tenure where a lack of work ethics is evident among certain individuals. It appears that there may be a perception of favoritism towards specific employees by recruitment head, which has resulted in a sense of unfair treatment among other team members. These people hold a disproportionate amount of decision-making authority, which jeopardizes the company's ability to operate fairly. It is regrettable that a business of this magnitude is perceived as operating like a small family-owned business, where personal relationships take precedence over fairness and merit. Those who reject it or disagree with it run the risk of being excluded. The influence of boss extend to the human resource creating a situation where the company is being run solely according to his preferences. With regards to a review provided by another female employee, the working conditions are deemed to be extremely inadequate, and one must become accustomed to receiving derogatory comments and attitudes, unless they are from chenai. The presence of institutional racism and ethnic discrimination within this company is evident. It is my recommendation to refrain from engaging with virtusa. Your dignity will be shaken by comments and accidentally touching from the boss's favorite."

Unless you're a native Tamilian, the working environment is like working in hell. Tamil is a frequently used language in offices and numerous meetings when people ask each other questions they don't want you to know. It's common to look at somebody, say something in Tamil, and then laugh. For lunch and supper, only certain employees are invited. We are never even invited, but they always order extra food to take home and expense it in our name. These guys act in a very petty manner while earning a significant wage from the corporation. You can anticipate another staff member from Chennai when a USA employee is fired. We are viewed as underperforming employees because they don't share any knowledge or consider us to be a part of the team. The rules are different for everybody, and you have to forget about promised raises and promotions if you don't fall into that family. you have to accept them, otherwise you will be demoted or given a task to complete without any help or information, at which point your boss will continue to put you down in front of everyone until you breakdown. you can never win a fight with your boss and your boss will make you realize the power he has. On the other hand, mani is a sinister and often makes vulgar comments, he is protected by boss. It's normal for them to miss work even on a family birthday, but if you have a medical emergency, you'll have to provide justification for the next few weeks and you'll always be ridiculed, even criticized. called old."

They must undoubtedly leave the job culture from Chennai. To remain in their comfort zone, they break all the norms. I've been screamed at numerous times in front of vendors or other people without any remorse from him. My manager refused to let me recommend my degree-holding cousin for a job yet boss permitted the vendor's son to complete an internship. I was fired one day and didn't have the guts to write a review out of fear that he could offer me negative feedback. I feel that I need to be heard and that human resources should take action against him in light of previous reviews. Everybody had distinct rules to follow. While I was expected to abide by the return to office rules, some personnel were allowed the opportunity to operate remotely or even outside of the nation if they need to. The fact that Human Resources officers were women is a sad fact, but she never stood by us or even took action against these particular people for making vulgar remarks, harassing us, and using innuendo in many cases."

Are you earning for the company or not. A large part of your review is based on % of utilization. In other words are you earning for the company and in a contract. As a technologist you have very little control over this. This is wholly the purview of the sales team. So if they aren't bringing in work, you will get punished for it.

Lumen,1,45291,Hunger Games environment,Senior Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",,Remote work and the benefits are good,"You've read about the layoffs. Those happen in a lot of companies. How they do it has screwed the enterprise. The people to be let go as part of the RIF is decided at the vice president level, not directors or managers...the VP who sorts the list of people by how much they are paid and they RIF the people at the top of the pay scale. The company hardly has any SME's left. Common practice for the only person who knows how a system works to get RIF'd. The company has more or less lobotomized itself. Ability to turn up new service and keep existing systems working has been gutted. Infrastructure is failing due to age. Many critical systems and platforms are 20 years old in many cases. When a platform is retired from being many years past end of life, it is replaced with used equipment that is also past end of life but not as much. Replacement parts are bought from ebay. 

New CEO is an improvement over the one that was fired a year ago, but her big changes has mostly been hiring on additional presidents and VPs. The company is very top-heavy. She's changing the culture of the company based off of a self help book called Dare to Lead. The obsession with this book and the lady who wrote it is approaching Kool Aid cult levels. They just restructured the companies debt. This was after the stock hit 80 cents a share. The creditor are going to end up owning what's left of the company in a couple years. The asset sale to Apollo wrecked the enterprise. All of the free cash flow came from the ILEC that they sold to them.
If you take a job here get as much as you can when you start because you'll go years before seeing a raise, and what you get won't be a lot. They fired all of their recruiters a few years ago and turned it all over to ""Hirevue"" which is a data mining outfit that in order to even be considered for a job, you have to make a dozen tick-tock style videos for them and play some games. And they wonder why qualified people won't apply here."

It was like walking into a marketing department in the 90s before a company had a CRM. Leaders were 50-60 yo women who couldn't talk about data intelligently. Every 4 months reorganization with the leadership never changing bc they were all cronies from various companies while leads literally dropped more than 50% y/y. I'd seen more sophisticated marketing 15 years ago in a company half that sized. Truly sad to see a once-great company become a shell of itself. I participated in a diversity and inclusion council where we had to recruit an African American member after winning the company's award for best diversity council in the country. Never thought I'd see a diversity council headed by a bunch of white women whose idea of diversity activities was volunteering at food pantries. Company spent millions on a new marketing program and didn't even have the capabilities to inform their customers of their new branding.

Service and IT side of the business has had great success and leadership. If you play the political game, you will fit in.","Change is inevitable in every organization, but when you have a new CEO and CMO nearly every year it makes it impossible to adapt and evolve to an every-changing business strategy. Constant reorganizations and layoffs leaves a culture of fear. Company has rebranded twice in 2-3 years. The consequences of poorly-managed organizational transformation has been devastating. Marketing changes goals so often before implementation has even happened. CMO and Leadership are self-serving at the cost of the workers. Do not expect to bring ideas to the table to make improvements, because leadership already knows what to do. Marketing leadership, including CMO has a lack of care, lack of transparency, lack of trust, enlarged ego, unwillingness to listen to employees, and are lacking passion and charisma. If you are a hard worker, you will get rewarded with more work or a layoff, not a pat on the back or a raise. Lots of money spent on new marketing initiatives with failing results.

It was just part of the job. The company culture took a steep dive after Mike Lawrie came aboard to carve up the company to sell. Morale hit an all time low and I decided that CSC was no longer a place I could all home which led me to consider other job opportunities outside the company. I do miss my old peeps but staying would have been at the expense of my own health always wondering and worrying if the pink slip would shown up tomorrow. I still maintain a friendship with some of my old coworkers who tell me that things have not gotten any better; perhaps maybe even worse than when I left the company over 2 years ago. This reinforces that it was a good time for me to leave when I did.

Overpaid upper management can't stem the loss, so bonuses for sub-executives are gone, benefits are slashed, and the bench system- where if your business unit closes then you are put on retainer until a new opening appears- is gone. When I started 3 years ago, I could afford the PPO for my whole family, now I can barely manage the HDCP.

The company is so large that management has their heads in the clouds about all this- employees drop or get laid off left and right and whole contracts are left to rot, while the CEO and national management hold lavish meetings and huge all-hands conferences to tell us how great everything is. How great is it? So great that the company just split in a desperate attempt to separate the reliable but low-earning public contracts from the bigger, riskier private ones.

CSC is a textbook example of a company that had it all then lost it due to bad management, and it has suffered as a workplace for it."

CSC India (FSG unit) is a cost center and hence follows a business model which purely services onsite teams and projects. There is no scope of control although employees are accountable for the piece of assignment they are working on. All my proactive suggestions were warded off as silly but management wanted to implement them 2 years later when client started demanding for those features. This is a clear showcase of short-sightedness seen in FSG unit's management. 

Recognition for one's accomplishments are purely on manager's discretion which is usually heavily biased on few people in the team.

The sick time policy does not reward good health.  CSC’s policy is “use it or lose it”.  You might want to consider what other companies are doing, such as General Dynamics.  They treat unused sick time as earned time, and buy it from the employee when terminating.
Unpaid extra hours – no benefit sharing.  When employees work extra hours at my client, CSC billed the full rate, and shared none of it with the employee.  You might want to consider sharing some of the extra revenue with the people who create it.
CSC has a good policy regarding customer service, but no policy regarding internal culture.  Internal teams can have hampered productivity because of friction and conflict.  A good source of information on internal culture is Dave Ramsey’s teachings, he’s had some good material in Entreleadership podcasts.  Here is a summary:
•	No gossip, no negative comments about others unless you are talking to someone who can solve the problem.  No hidden agendas.  Have humility.  Even the most brilliant among us have made dumb statements and decisions.
•	Have grace for others.  No disagreements except at public meetings.  It is OK to have conflict, calm is not the goal.  If you’re fuming inside, talk about it with the right person.
•	Treat others with dignity and respect.  Have praise.
QA procedures – there is some redundancy and overlap.  Example: the project definition and BSDR have overlapping content."

It takes pride in comparing with other services companies like Infosys and wipro. Where as considering it's size and historical background it should be compared with product companies like Microsoft and Oracle.
It tries to do a catch up game on most technologies and more over there is a big gap in marketing.
LEF and Delivery gaps are very wide.
There is a step motherly treatment for Delivery centers. E.g. there is no reason social networking sites should be blocked in India and open in other locations. 
Many often I have seen it competing with other companies on price margin to win projects.

They have very large pay ranges so you aren't likely to bump into a situation where you can't get a raise because you hit the ceiling.  Bonuses are available if you are at a high enough grade (mostly second level management up).,They work you to death.  No regard for your personal life (I was contacted on vacation and while at home sick).  You could get promoted but at the cost of more of your personal life. They liked to pigeon hole you in certain areas making it difficult to expand your technical knowledge into new upcoming areas.  Personal growth was not anything I experienced. I have grown a lot more personally since I left.

A person who you didn't work for, yet alone even know, wrote and approved your evaluation. The rating scale was absolutely ridiculous as well. I don't believe in inflated evaluations, but so many people who worked their tails off every day did not get the credit they so deserved. Pay raises were a joke as well. Now with the new evaluation system, pay raises are non existent to the average joe employee who needs them most. The new leave policy is absolutely ridiculous as well. Employees are no longer able to carry leave over from year to year. You have to use it during the year you accrued it. Vacation time is being forced on employees whether they want to take it or not."

Many talented people who were recently hired were laid off without warning - more likely due to contractual requirements in the HPE Services ""Merger"". 

This has created a spooky culture of ""who's going to die next?!"" - which includes management all the way up. I watched numerous talented managers simply quit and go elsewhere because they could not stomach the carnage. Same for very talented consultants. 

The CEO is on a ""digital transformation"" binge and core business areas are being left in the dust and creating angry customers who  are switching to more professional and reliable consulting organizations. People are laid off with no warning and it has had a chilling effect throughout the company. There's a general feeling that no valuable leadership is in place in North America."

Recently, CSC made changes to:

In most cases the direct supervisor worked in an entirely separate office or location, sometimes in another part of the world.

The 401k match is an abysmal 2%, which falls far below industry standards.

A significant concern is the complete lack of employee care exhibited by the HR department. They irresponsibly delay immigration applications, jeopardizing individuals' legal status. Urgent requests for their attention (""ASAP"") are expected, but when employees seek assistance, responses are consistently slow or nonexistent.

Onboarding was a bit of a mess at the client site, but everything worked out in the end. PTO policy is not the best: Only about 10 days off a year, and they aren't even banked at the start of the year, so you have to slowly accrue them (3 hours per 2 weeks). PTO policy is not very competitive with similar paying jobs in the IT sector, especially considering a lot of companies are giving unlimited PTO nowadays as long as you get your job done.

Every agent here is great and very intelligent we all work together in groups there is really no issue with any agent. Everyone is really great over all!",I don't have none at this time!
UST,5,44897,review on Ust,Customer Service Representative (CSR),Current Employee,"Corpus Christi, TX",Team leads seem like they are willing to help you out,I feel like in training at times we learn one thing one day then the next day jump to something else which i didn't like i got confused a lot. Then half of us didn't have access to the programs we going to use so we had screen share.
UST,3,44827,Just Ok!!,Architect II,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Aliso, CA","Trivandrum campus make you feel like home.

Lot of learning opportunities if you are willing to learn. UST deals with multiple technologies. Gives us flexibility to move inside different projects.","I have been with UST for many years. Mostly its a people centric company not a process driven one. Managers are mostly old timers and they don't like the people under them grow. Most leaders are not leaders they are typical Bosses. Visionaries are less. Company boast about profits every year, but as an employee my question is what's in it for a regular employee. 

There is hardly a bonus unless your manager puts some efforts to get you something. Company talks a lot about Humanity, Humility, etc but are we really following it from the grass level. Leaders should take effort to understand the root level of the problems. Why are we not becoming an Infosys, Wipro, TCS. If we dig deep we will understand.

Good resources are not paid well and we should have 360 degree feedback system. Why cant an employee give feedback about manager? Lot of internal politics."
ServiceNow,5,45321,A model company with the perfect say:do ratio,Sales Compensation Communications Manager,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Boston, MA","I've never worked anywhere or with anyone quite like I have at ServiceNow. Everything is just better. The people-first focus is so loud and clear to my experience so far. I've referred nearly 10 people in my 6 months. I'm VERY interested to see my career journey unfold here. I could see myself growing into different roles. 

A few highlights:
- Unlimited PTO (& everyone means it and encourages PTO)
- True flexibility in a remote/hybrid environment (no pressure to be online and responsive 24/7, everyone is human here)
- Competitive, negotiable pay
- Incredible transparency from the C-suite
- Focus & resources on development
- People do what they say they will do","Joining any company has its challenges. Still, I've had virtually very little since joining. 

My challenges include:
- Finding the right stakeholders across a large, matrixed environment to collaborate with
- Being in a role that is new & unique. No one else on my team does what I do or anything similar 
- Not a ton of visibility into everything in the works from my leader (Which would help me in planning new ideas + moving things forward)
- Learning the products & services. There's a lot, it's a learning curve that everyone is on"
ServiceNow,5,45328,Amazing company to work at,Product Strategist,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Los Angeles, CA","- A+ culture. Vast majority of people are kind, approachable, hardworking, smart, ambitious
- Great work life balance
- Excellent compensation, yearly bonus, benefits, unlimited PTO (actively encouraged and tracked with your manager - not a sham) 
- One of the few if only tech companies right now with high morale
- Exciting growth period, especially as company hits financial targets ahead of schedule
- Investment in personal development
- Commitment to DE&I, volunteering, generous stipends to donate to non-profits
- Flexible WFH policy. No mandates so far to return to office, which is also rare for tech companies these days
- MyServiceNow is the best onboarding and employee hub I've ever used. Incredible AI integrations where you can find contacts, information, glossaries, etc. with one search","- Onboarding contains a lot of content, especially if you're not familiar with ServiceNow's platform operability. However, as mentioned above, the onboarding platform is incredible and helps you stay on track. Your manager also gives you time to get this done 
- Pace is extremely quick, which can sometimes create gaps in communication and task delegation
- ServiceNow has so many products within its platform - focus on learning the basics of the products most relevant to your line of work"
ServiceNow,5,45281,Best Culture and Best Tech in the Business,Customer Success Manager,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",,"There is a genuine commitment and distinctive vibe when it comes to values. Inclusion and belonging exceeds the positive values that is communicated. It's no surprise ServiceNow is highlighted for so many workforce categories, but the one that energizes me most is America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity.

The company is a global tech hub. All teams across departments are diverse and assembled with talented folks. Our success can be attributed to our high influential CEO and the strategic decision making of the leadership team. From the P4 to your direct manager and peer teammates are top caliber individuals in the technology industry. Goals and expectations are personalized so that you are evolving professionally. ServiceNow celebrates your achievements and is a steadfast champion.

The office spaces, perks, and employee benefits are super nice. Flexible work arrangements and family-oriented programs so that you are able to do your best work and live well. A good mix of company events and social activities across the company. Professional development opportunities are endless at ServiceNow. 

The platform stays fresh and ahead of market trends with regular enhancements. Customers have a range of selections to maximize the value of the technology. Robust security measures to protect customer data and build trust. First movers in multiple verticals. I've worked in the big five tech, and I am blown away at how much new innovation is live in the current release and road mapped for future releases. ServiceNow is the largest rocket ship I have ever been on!",I wish I joined ServiceNow sooner because this has been my best tech experience in over 10 years.
ServiceNow,3,45335,Great Presentation with Underlying Problems,Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Vienna, VA","ServiceNow talks a big game and in many ways follows through. The C-Suite is largely competent and their performance has consistently led to the stock price increasing.

Broadly, the company culture is supportive and talks a big game when it comes to DEI. Broadly, the company lives up to its stated goals but experiences vary depending on the team. 

The company is a rocket ship and the momentum is palpable.","Your experience at ServiceNow will depend on the team that you are on.

Managers run their teams as their own personal fiefdoms and experiences can vary. Some managers are not qualified for their jobs. 

The company's public sector strategy is not good. Recent hiring decisions have made it clear the company prioritizes short term gain over long term sustainability. This will likely negatively affect ServiceNow in the long run."
ServiceNow,2,45266,"Great people, terrible processes",Senior Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Santa Clara, CA","Overwhelmingly the greatest people you will ever work with - smart, hard working, and kind to each other
Whatever experience you want to grow professionally, you will find it here
CEO Bill McDermott is inspiring everytime he talks - he is a true visionary and the company is fortunate to have him","Most processes (ironically) are still very manual. As the company grows and changes, the tools and technology aren't updated leaving teams with unmanageable amounts of manual work. This is raised as biggest issue every year in employee feedback surveys, but nothing ever improves, just more manual work to compensate for bad tools and processes
Lots of pressure from leaders to deliver results, but no direction or support to improve - they promise it, then back out when it's time to deliver on their promises - yet they still expect perfect execution from their teams
Most teams are completely burned out - unrealistic expectations and demands without support. No time to do anything but work - no time for learning, career development, or even vacation (time off = work builds up, so you either work while on vacation and/ or work even more hours when you're back just to get caught up)"
ServiceNow,2,45322,Mixed experiences in my first month at ServiceNow France,Regional Partnership Manager,Current Employee,,"Competitive Salaries: the compensation at ServiceNow is commendable and aligns well with industry standards.
Product : AWESOME platform !!!!!","Cultural disconnect: The work culture in the French office seems misaligned with the global ethos of ServiceNow. This has been a significant concern during my initial days here.
Onboarding challenges: My onboarding experience was marred by delays and a lack of support. The delayed delivery of my laptop significantly hampered my ability to start effectively, and the response from my manager added to the stress rather than alleviating it.
Age dynamics: The average age at the office appears to skew over 50, creating an implicit bias towards younger employees like myself. This age dynamic seems to affect perceived credibility and acceptance within the team.
Work-life balance: There's an unspoken expectation to work long hours, which is not necessarily linked to productivity or efficiency. This old-school mentality clashes with the innovative image projected by ServiceNow externally.
Limited diversity in Recruitment: The hiring pattern predominantly favors candidates from specific former employers (X-Oracle, X-Salesforce, X-Microsoft), which leads to a lack of diverse perspectives in the workplace."
ServiceNow,5,45321,"Great first year, excited for the future!",Renewal Account Manager,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Amsterdam,"It has been a great experience working at ServiceNow. From the hiring process, to onboarding, ramping up with fellow new hires, as well as getting the trust and support from my teammates has been nothing short of fantastic. When joining, coming from a small software company that I've been a part of for nearly 13 years, I did wonder if I was going to be 'one of many' and would get lost in such a large organization. ServiceNow has proven to me over the past year that this fear could not be further from the truth; I feel welcomed and really experienced that I directly contribute to how well ServiceNow is doing, together with my direct team and everyone!","As ServiceNow has been growing so incredibly fast, there are some systems & processes that are only now catching up to where they need to be. ServiceNow has been transparent with me what these challenges were and they have been open to critical feedback, all with the intention of becoming better."
ServiceNow,5,45324,Best company I worked for,Customer Success Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Dublin, Dublin","Great perks, you will be working with very smart people and learning a lot. 
The product is amazing, the culture in the company as well. 
No micro management and very free to get the job done as you want to do it. I love it!","There is a lot happening so you have to be ready to adapt to change and also to deal with ambiguity.
Sometimes roles are not so clear and can be understood differently by different people"
ServiceNow,5,45328,On a rocketship and feeling confident in this company,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",,"Fast growing company that is paying off to its employees -- stock is doing extremely well, benefits and pay are good (I feel well compensated for a non-technical role). They keep culture at the center, but I would encourage leadership to make sure not to lose sight of it as we continue to climb up.","A lot of growing pains because we are scaling so quickly as a company. Lots of operational rigor that is needed, but everybody is moving too fast that the systems and processes that need to be in place aren't being placed fast enough."
ServiceNow,3,45324,Some Growing Up To Do,Sales,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Atlanta, GA","The company's stock is doing well. So, get RSUs. Pays on the upper end of market -- Insurance was average. Products seem good, perhaps a bit pricey. Not overly high pressure - which ends up being a con if you're looking for commissions.","It's a product-driven company with no real sales discipline to speak of. They haven't figured out account-based selling, differing to reactionary transactions driven by the customer, ignoring a prescriptive vision and roadmap for the account. That worked at the outset but will limit growth to the next level if they want to get dollars outside of IT."
ServiceNow,5,45320,The Candyland of Tech Companies,Sr. Sales Recruiting,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Dallas, TX","Top thing after a year of being here was I told a friend about the culture from the bottom up and how everyone has been very nice, professional, helpful and just a delight to work with. The leaders here communicate everything that is going on with the company i.e. our successes, new technology, no layoffs last year! We hit our numbers because the attitude here is just refreshing! I wish more could see how great this company is and will be in 20 years! Come join us this year!",I really don't have any cons working here. Ok our recruiting system needs some updating but they are working on it!

Strong products and engineering organization. The ""hungry and humble"" culture is real and awesome. If you are a specialist and find the team that needs your specialized skills in the company, this is truly a great place to work.","Very frequent turn-over and reorgs at the SVP and VP levels means frequently changing priorities and having to justify / defend teams and budgets again and again. Very hard to change roles within the company. Across functions, there is a strong preference to hiring from outside, especially for management roles (Sr. Manager / Director and above)."
ServiceNow,5,45252,Best Place to work,Principal Product Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Hyderābād,"Innovative Culture: ServiceNow thrives on innovation. The company encourages employees to think outside the box, contributing to a dynamic and forward-thinking work environment.

Collaborative Work Environment: Teamwork is at the core of ServiceNow's success. The collaborative culture here fosters effective communication and the ability to work seamlessly across departments.

Strong Leadership: The leadership team is transparent, approachable, and truly invested in the success of the employees. Their guidance provides a clear vision for the company's future.

Employee Benefits: ServiceNow values its employees and it shows in the comprehensive benefits package. From health and wellness programs to flexible work schedules, the company prioritizes the well-being of its workforce.

Inclusive Workplace: ServiceNow is committed to diversity and inclusion. The company promotes a culture of acceptance, where every employee feels valued and appreciated.

Cutting-edge Technology: Working at ServiceNow means being at the forefront of technological advancements. The tools and technologies available make our work efficient and exciting.","Fast-Paced Environment: The rapid pace of innovation and growth might be overwhelming for some individuals, especially those who prefer a more steady or predictable work environment.

Work-Life Balance: Depending on the role and projects, maintaining a perfect work-life balance can be challenging. Some positions may require extra effort during peak times."

ServiceNow,3,45261,Awards don't tell the full story,Senior Solution Consulting Manager,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Nashville, TN","Amazing people - helpful, genuine, very few jerks. Highly collaborative culture and most employees do embrace the ""hungry and humble"" mantra. Great benefits. Lots of training opportunities and truly supportive of internal mobility. Products are spectacular, which makes them easier to sell.","Over the last 6 years, as revenue and stock price have skyrocketed, even through the pandemic, our CEO goes on CNBC every time we release financial results to talk about how awesome we're doing, how we're leading the market in so many metrics (which we are). 

The problem is, every year we get fewer headcount to grow our teams, less money to award for raises, less stock to hand out to top talent as a retention tool. We've recently added forced ranking to employee performance reviews and put a significant downward squeeze on promotions and a complete halt to any off-cycle promotions. Span of control for managers is being hiked from 7 to 10. This represents a MASSIVE disconnect, and it's not sustainable. You can't have both sides of that coin - the company is doing great but we don't have a travel budget. You can't brag about how awesome the firm is doing and be genuine in thanking the employees for their hard work that's getting us there, and then also say ""there's no money for raises, promotions, or new headcount, do more with less and be glad we haven't had layoffs."" Top execs are absolutely taking advantage of the fact that this is a crap economy which makes it hard for people to leave. 

They've basically adopted the Jack Welch curve for performance - forcing managers to score 60% of employees as ""middle of the road."" Anyone scored above average they now make managers write a book report to justify it. That's not uncommon, and it would work fine at HP or IBM where you expect to be operating inside a corporate bureaucratic beast that treats you like a number. But that's not why people come to ServiceNow. It's ridiculously hard to get into ServiceNow these days because so many people are looking to leave that kind of nonsense. Except, now that nonsense is creeping in here, too. You can't hire the cream of the crop (which we've really worked hard to do) and then tell 60% of them they're ""solid, middle of the road"" performers. It creates huge dissonance."

Lenovo,2,45327,Gradually losing the plot,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,"Morrisville, NC","My direct colleagues are some of the brightest people I have ever worked with, good benefits package.","Old, out of touch, senior management is slowly deteriorating the culture of the company. For a company who wants to pride themselves on innovation and being on the cutting edge, you won't find any people in leadership who aren't old men, over the age 45 who are all stuck in the past. Many of them are IBM relics and their management style and priorities show. No projects or initiatives are about advancing the mission of the company and is instead all about internal optics, pontificating, and doing favors for their buddies on other teams, and the people in the middle and bottom are getting absolutely crushed as a result. Pay hasn't been competitive in years. Just when employees were finally enjoying their WFH flexibility as a result of COVID (during which we saw increased employee engagement scores and our greatest all-time revenue generated), senior leadership is now forcing workers to come in 3 days a week and are tracking WiFi signals to verify they are in the office for a full day. There have been no perks introduce to ease employees in, not even free coffee for a Fortune 500 company, and on any given day, 65% of the external monitors will not work."

What keeps me here is the people, the work flexibility, and interesting work. I have a supportive boss and there no drama in the group. Everyone wants to help one another and doesn't complain. I set my own schedule, so long as I get my work done. We are now hybrid and I like the mix. Lenovo has an open work place and we were hybrid before Covid. There are usually weekly events that you can attend if you are on-site, ie. personal development and wellness workshops, seminars to learn more about the business etc.",The systems and processes seem behind for a large global company and the base pay seems less competitive than similar companies. Benefits are competitive.

They sponsor people from overseas who do not have any culture fit which makes work harder. Pushing is the only way to get result what they want without appreciation. Some people look nice but political, the rest all live in another culture. Lenovo is just a based Sydney company but not Australian at all, people you work with has problem control themselves emotions, easily go stress then you are the only one to hold the crap.

they have a business model that encourages new employees in and get the old ones out or make them uncomfortable.

I went an entire year working remote, and not one manager reached out to me to give me a heads up on my performance, and the only times they will reach out is to tell you how bad you are doing and will falsify Quality Assurance scores, to encourage you to feel as though you don't belong or you're not doing a good job. Furthermore, they don't encourage promoting within, when you try to go for a higher position, they will ignore you or just tell you it's no longer available. There is definitely favoritism at this place for sure, those they like they will ignore their bad, and continue to give them praise, but if they don't like you...

they will falsify scores, to make you feel stupid
they will write you up by micromanaging you, making you feel like you need to be on your best behavior.
then they will just complete Freeze you out, and won't speak to you, but only to let you know that you need to get your act together, even though you have been there for 5 years.

I've never felt so cold and alone at this job. there are so many Mental Days that i've had to take, and i never would have thought a company like this would tear down my mental health as this job has.

Be at this job for at least 6 months to a year, and please get out as soon as possible, because the longer you stay, the more they will find ways to see how they can get you out of there.

Oh yeah, forget about your free time, because you will be working 5 days a week, 50 hours, so yeah, the time for you to be able to do things with friends, you can say goodbye to that."

Lenovo,1,45232,Toxic Place,Procurement,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","São Paulo, São Paulo","Good colleagues, but nothing else.","Toxic Work Environment: Working at this company feels like a never-ending nightmare. From the moment I joined, I was exposed to a culture of fear, intimidation, and backstabbing. It's a daily struggle to navigate the political landmines just to keep your job. Poor Leadership: The company is rife with incompetent and unqualified leadership. It's not uncommon to witness leaders belittling employees, displaying favoritism, and making arbitrary decisions that negatively impact the team. They lack transparency and often hide crucial information from employees. Unreasonable Expectations: The workload at this company is beyond excessive, and you're expected to work long hours, including nights and weekends, without overtime pay. The constant pressure to meet unrealistic targets takes a toll on your mental and physical health. Lack of Respect for Work-Life Balance: The company doesn't respect the concept of work-life balance. Expect to be on call 24/7, even during your vacations or personal time. It's nearly impossible to disconnect from work, leading to burnout and strained personal relationships. High Turnover: Due to the toxic environment, poor leadership, and excessive demands, the company experiences a high turnover rate. Talented employees leave as soon as they find better opportunities, which further contributes to the toxic cycle. Stagnant Career Growth: Career growth and development opportunities are virtually non-existent. Promotions are based on favoritism rather than merit, and it's disheartening to see hardworking individuals overlooked for advancement. In conclusion, this company is a prime example of a toxic work environment. If you value your mental and emotional well-being, I strongly advise you to steer clear of this organization. Look for companies that respect their employees, promote a healthy work-life balance, and provide growth opportunities. Your career and overall happiness deserve better than what this company has to offer."

They forget that remote jobs are a thing since Covid and they pay double or triple the base pay at Ingram. While they love to tout their company culture as a retention factor, the recent trend of high turnover with both people leaving and being let go is quite concerning. Ingram Micro will be going public in the summer/fall of 2023 and as a result, they are laying off employees in batches to streamline operations. Tenured employees are not safe at Ingram.

Workday,4,45331,Navigating a Dynamic Environment,Associate,Former Employee,"Denver, CO","Working at Workday offers numerous benefits that make it an attractive choice for full-time associates. The company's culture of innovation fosters creativity and pushes employees to think outside the box. This emphasis on innovation creates a dynamic work environment where associates can contribute to cutting-edge projects and technologies. Workday prioritizes work-life balance, providing flexible schedules and remote work options that enable effective management of professional and personal commitments. The supportive environment encourages collaboration, fostering camaraderie among teams. The company invests in employees' growth through various training programs and advancement opportunities, ensuring they have resources to thrive. Overall, working at Workday offers the chance to make a meaningful impact, grow professionally, and be part of a forward-thinking culture.","While there are benefits to working at Workday, there are also drawbacks to consider. The fast-paced nature of the work environment can be overwhelming for some individuals, requiring a high level of flexibility and resilience. High expectations for performance may lead to stress and burnout, particularly for those who prefer a more relaxed work environment. Achieving work-life balance may be challenging, especially in roles with on-call availability or tight deadlines. Navigating the complex organizational structure may require time and effort, particularly for new employees. The competitive atmosphere, while driving innovation, may not suit everyone, particularly those who prefer a more collaborative work environment. Despite these drawbacks, the benefits of working at Workday make it an attractive option for many full-time associates."
Workday,3,45028,Good People with a Slipping Culture,Senior Principal Consultant,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,Individuals still believe in the culture that was present when we joined. Time Off flexibility is still good at least in the teams I've been part of. Great healthcare benefits,"Lack of transparency and sense of company direction. We talk a good game but have lost our commitment to customer and instead are focusing on flashy sponsorships, company acquisitions, and developing large amounts of low-quality content to give the appearance of progress. Layoffs. We were told we wouldn't be laying off, then they said the layoffs would be limited, but we gave the laid off workers rules around what they could and could not say to give a flowery appearance while threatening the livelihoods of the talent we let go. Many job offers rescinded and forced to re-apply or kicked out due to the new back to office policy. Baseless 'return to office' requirements. Sheri is mandating new roles be located near offices significantly reducing talent pool. We have yet to see any real data supporting the claims for their decisions. Pay cuts disguised as updated compensation philosophy. Good ol' boy culture among Sr Management and above. The executive teams are very preppy and there is no defined path to leadership, only the in-crowd seems to get promoted."

Many people end up moving to other departments and it's not frowned upon.","Some departments have a better laid out promotional plan than others.

Highly intelligent and capable for the most part.,"Where to start? When I first joined WD it was an incredible place. I felt like it was too real to be true. Unfortunately I was right. After much turmoil, an org restructure, layoffs and then a new organization - we finally settled with terrible middle management. The entire Org is constantly giving feedback especially about management but the feedback falls on deaf ears.  Leadership is detrimental, turnover is happening at a high rate and there are rumors of ethics complaints and a potential discrimination class action lawsuit coming together because of bullying, harassment, and discrimination. Morale is incredibly low. Work is incredibly overloaded and if you complain you are pushed out. If you are suspected of giving negative feedback you become a target. Fear drives the org. It’s incredible work we are doing, But the treatment received is toxic and abusive. Leadership continues to pat themselves on the back but it’s ridiculous when the team is running on fumes except those with preferential treatment.   I am really happy to be out but feel so bad for everyone else that has been left behind. GPO really has to get rid of the toxic leadership to avoid not only a lawsuits, but the breakdown of the organization."

High workload, if you are looking for work life balance, this is not the place for you, at least not in the SRE space. 10-12 hours days are quite common.

This place is hyped up but do not fall for it. After working tirelessly for close to four years to build a whole team from the ground up, I was asked to leave with a meagre severance package. The initial shock was unfathomable. Every person that I worked with including my own team (that I also build from scratch) was shattered and thought I was joking when I said I was being asked to leave. The impact that we had created as a team was large and the change that I orchestrated was felt through out the company and I had won accolades and many recommendations and reviews for it. My manager knew nothing about our business area but was still asked to lead a significant charter including my team which she knew absolutely nothing about. She was close to a certain someone in the C-suite. She was asked to leave a few months after I left but the damage was done and irreversible. No one questioned her and I had to leave a thriving team and work behind. Now they have opened a role again and it is the same role that I had. Why wasn't I given that opportunity when my team and I proved our worth so many times through such impactful work? It is dirty politics. It is a SHAM! Please BEWARE!!"

Generally, there is respect for individuals","* Understanding how to operate as a diverse workplace is largely lacking. Rather than updating our ""game"" and making new inclusive ways of working, people who have different backgrounds or approaches are seen as low performers and get pushed out. * Managers talk and gossip about employees entirely too much. It's unfair to the individual especially when they don't hear the feedback directly or given a chance to share their side. *Org leaders don't know what is going on with their teams. They are too busy helping sales or making the senior leaders happy with unhelpful processes to spend time on managing people. * Internal applications to other positions require current manager approval, which makes the process difficult. You are treated differently as soon as they know you're interested in something else. There can be micro-retaliations that are hard to prove, but you can feel it. When we apply outside of the company, no one knows. Why is it acceptable to require we share for internal?"

I can only imagine what it is like for folks with kids. It is not flexible at all. Stock incentive for total comp is out the window unless you work in PLS.

Very small number of minority IC's within TA to include people leaders. People fear leveraging Peakon surveys for fear of retaliation from management. Many workmates feel they have no voice and it's best to hush up do your job and don't challenge. The process for recruiting minority talent across the board is really sad and slow. Most of the leaders received their roles from word a net work at Workday and NOT solely because they are the best qualified for the positions they have. Leadership, does not like the low numbers of minority/diverse talent and complain about it. When offered suggestions to do better and improve. Many leaders would argue with extreme tension/aggression but not willing to change their ways or processes. Workday places profit over it's employee's. A shame when Employee focus is claimed to be a core value. Many of my workmates lost their jobs right before the the super bowl 3% company wide. But we were able to invest millions in a ad most people I know didn't even see. Those funds could've kept my workmates employed a bit while longer."

The company really cares for its employees overall and provides great benefits overall.,"Poor middle management in both Product and Engineering. Especially in Core HR. Unfortunately, many people were promoted to managers when the company grew very quickly a few years before the pandemic who shouldn't have been. A lot of favoritism in this division of the company and very little focus on meritocracy be it a promotion, an idea, or change. Poor product leadership and engineering leadership which resulted in many people leaving this organization across both pillars.

Citrix,4,45116,Not as Bad as it Was,Support and Services,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",,"I've been at Citrix now for a long time, and I'm one of the more tenured individuals still at the company. I've been in multiple positions and can speak to how the teams are being managed. This entire review will be broken down with Before Acqusition and After Acquisition, since a lot of the other reviews keep mentioning how things were while wearing rose tinted glasses. Before Acqusition Pro's (No longer valid): ================================ - More team outtings, more team dinners, better team building activities. - Culture was better for smaller teams, and harder to improve for larger teams due to budgetary concerns. - Sales cycle was fine at first, became very convoluted towards the end - Publicly traded so we had the ability to do a Stock Purchase Plan - 1-2 Work-from-Home days for certain Orgs, or full remote for other Orgs. - Great new hire experience until we were fully remote during Covid, new hires failed often when full remote due to the lacking training infrastructure for this model - More laid-back environment, but came at a cost of nothing really getting done towards the end. After Acquisition Pro's ================== - We're now fully in office (also has some CONs in of itself), making the new hire experience significantly better, and reduced the time to train from (fully remote) 12-16 months to 6-12 months due to real time collaboration. - Getting headcount that we desperately needed in many orgs (see cons) - Good restructure that makes sense on paper - Reduced linear reporting, no longer have Sr Managers reporting to Sr Managers reporting to Sr Managers. Now it's more linear and easy to follow - Payscale increases to be at or above industry standard, significantly reducing churn comparatively - Promotion opportunities more easily accessible - Complete redesign of our internal Standard Operating Procedures, making things make sense again. - Company hands out Private Equity Shares to those who contribute to getting things back on track - When you need to work from home, you can. There is a system in place that allows you to work from home with your direct Managers approval. - Unlimited PTO if given 2 weeks in advance. Sick Days are still metered, but PTO for trips and such are not. - Still has great insurance and benefits as we did prior to the Acqusition, though I do miss the EPO plan which was removed.","Most of the information needing to read will be in this section. Having read through almost all of the reviews since the acqusition, many of these reviewers tend to look at the past with rose tinted glasses. I'm sure the experience between these individuals is drastically different than my own or even each other, but it's important to remember that our stock price didn't fall to $90/share because of what our new leadership did. The old leadership did a number on the Citrix organization that will take years to recover from, and the anger rightly deserves to rest with them. Not to say the new leadership is absolved from bad policy, but a majority of these policies are being created to fix what the former leadership did incorrectly. CONS: Prior to Acquisition: Prior to and up to Henshall and his subordinates ========================================================== - After Mark Templeton, Leadership cared more about the shareholders than you, and it was obvious. This got worse year over year. - Teams were completely gutted or skeleton crewed to make the numbers look better. - Hiring cycles were a disaster. You'd be given 30 days to fill x-number of req's, which included the time of advertising, interviewing, making a decision, etc. This forced teams to hire the ""good enough"" instead of the right talent. If you couldn't make a decision by your 30th day, then the req was frozen, pulled and who knows when it'd be released again. This caused us to not be able to staff people who left, let alone get the right headcount for the staff we needed. - Poor business decisions resulting in a very bi-polar stock price. I.E Temporary licenses during covid were an outright failure. Poor purchases that left us hundreds of millions of dollars in debt for an item that didn't improve our portfolio or weren't used at all. - Hyper investments into poor performing products that only proved the 'sunk cost fallacy' instead of investing where most of the money originated from. - High turnover of CEO's and C-suite employees. - High turnover in Support, Sales, Consulting, Technical Account Managers - Inability to retain top talent due to being underpaid by industry standard - Extremely prevalent 'Yes Man' culture once you get to Director or above (not in all cases, but many). CONS: New Leadership under Tom Krause ================================ - Mandatory RTO: those of us who did perform 100-150% when remote, were gaslit in the first GEM and made to believe that we were underperforming as a whole. Those of us who realized the benefits of working fully remote: less cost commuting, more time with family, a WAY better work-life balance are now all gone. However, the statstics that you can pull yourself using our own internal CRM system can prove that this was a minority of people. Many individuals were performing suboptimally, or barely hitting their KPI's. They were unresponsive, and some were blatantly caught working two jobs at the same time during the same hours (not moonlighting). This is first-hand experience, not me parrotting what someone else has said. - Engineering teams being treated as Support, makes it very hard to retain new talent in the Engineering spaces. They got hired to code, but are being used for Support purposes. - Sales have changed to prioritize the largest and above-the-line customers - Training content is also subpar for what we need. - Fatigued work-force (remnant from the old workforce, but makes people fatigued when the new processes from the new leadership come down the pipe). - New system software being used instead of the legacy software: Outlook replaced with Gmail, Teams replaced with Zoom. These are cost saving endeavors to avoid further layoffs, but these softwares are not enterprise ready and it makes your day to day harder to manage and organize. GMAIL is absolutely the worst offender of this due to how difficult it is to produce filters that make much sense."

New CEO is Tom Krause.,"- There doesn't seem to be an authentic caring about employees. - They are joining Citrix with TIBCO, yet no plan of how the 2 teams will work together technically. - Preference is given to TIBCO and their ""way"" even though they are half the size and were continually under-performing. - Making us use new software just to save a few dollars (i.e. Microsoft in favor of Google). It's embarrassing to use GMAIL as an Enterprise company. - They are following the Broadcom playbook as the CEO came from there. DO NOT work at Citrix (aka Cloud Software Group). - Feels like they are trying to sell things off and make Citrix just a niche corporation. Selling off Sharefile which is a tremendous part of the portfolio. - Merit Raises have been under inflation for 3 years now and now that there is no stock purchase plan, that is another 1.5% pay cut."

Too many people got greedy and as a channel person, I observed very quickly sales started being dishonest and taking deals direct.

Incompetent leaders that have no product knowledge, when asking them for advice, their only respond was to ‘look for the answer yourself’ and when any issue blows up, the responsibility will be just be pushed to the agents. 4. Contract staff are non-existence to the company, you just feel like a slave to the company, no benefits or bonuses (performance / AWS). Contract staff are not even invited to company events. 5. No cohesion between agents / supervisors and managers. Agents will be just in their own cliques. Supervisors and Managers will just separate themself, and only look for you to scold you. 6. Micromanaging, literally have a software to check what agent is doing every minute. Have to inform going to the bathroom / lunch etc and will be timed. Otherwise deduction of pay. 7. No career advancement"

Tripadvisor employees are some of the most genuine, kind, and supportive group of individuals. Sr. leadership is very down-to-earth, and feedback and ideas are expected and encouraged from every level of the organization. I have to give a special shout out to people ops and talent acquisition who are an incredibly hard working and compassionate team-driven group. Benefits! The reviews don't lie folks. The benefits really are unmatchable, even compared to other large organizations. Flexibility, even within hybrid roles. This is especially true for working parents.

Tripadvisor,1,45301,A Regrettable Experience at Tripadvisor,Sales,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,Lifestyle benefit is a nice perk as well as the company shut down week between Christmas and New Years.,"I joined Tripadvisor with high hopes and enthusiasm, believing it would be a stepping stone for my career growth. However, my time at the company turned out to be the biggest regret of my professional life.

The company's primary focus appears to be solely on revenue, with little regard for the well-being of its employees or the satisfaction of its customers. The lack of value placed on both internal and external stakeholders is evident in every aspect of the organization.

One of the most glaring issues is the disorganized structure of the company. The communication and updates are shockingly poor, leaving employees in the dark about crucial information. Teams seem to lack passion for the business, resulting in a noticeable lack of desire to excel in their daily tasks.

The leadership team, unfortunately, is both inexperienced and unorganized. Their approach is not only tone-deaf but also sloppy, leaving employees feeling unsupported and undervalued. A striking example of this is the insistence on full-time office attendance while leaders enjoy vacations in exotic locations such as the Bahamas, joining meetings remotely. This stark contrast in expectations and actions highlights the lack of empathy and understanding within the leadership team.

Communication breakdowns are rampant, with emails frequently ignored, and political games playing a significant role in day-to-day operations. This creates an unhealthy work environment, contributing to the overall dissatisfaction among employees.

The benefits package provided by Tripadvisor is severely lacking, causing numerous headaches and troubleshooting efforts. There is a palpable lack of trust in how commissions are calculated and paid out, further eroding confidence in the company's transparency and fairness. In addition their were hidden cliffs with in 401k and RSU options. The limited support given to teams and customers alike underscores the company's lack of commitment to their well-being.

In conclusion, my experience at Tripadvisor has been nothing short of disappointing. This move, which I had initially looked forward to the most in my career, turned out to be a profound letdown. I strongly caution anyone considering employment with or engaging in business with Tripadvisor to think twice. The company's prioritization of revenue over its people and customers, combined with its organizational and leadership issues, make it an undesirable place to work or collaborate with."

- There is too much politicking. People have become territorial instead of cooperative which makes every day a slog.

Netflix,3,43363,How much does a functioning human cost?,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,"- Paycheck
- So many good people
- Such a great service
- Hope","I have been working for a year at Netflix.

I've seen what was supposed to be very mature people, sharing absolutely almost no contact that anyone would qualify as ""human"".
Sure, that sounds hyperbolic, let me develop (and maybe cherry-pick a little).

Have you heard about our culture? The one about giving candid feedback? - I have seen people complaining of behavior they literally demonstrated themselves in the following days.
But I have also seen these feedbacks resulting in tears both in the eyes of HR persons or fellow engineers. How human does that sound?

Have you heard about our culture? The one about not tolerating brilliant jerks? I have nonetheless seen angriness and frustration, expressed in private, public and meeting. People rejecting new ideas by default, like, any ideas they wouldn't have worked themselves on for days wouldn't count. Even if those ideas are from the best examples in the industry or academics. How many publications/contributions have you seen from Netflix to computer science in general? How does it compare against any other company of that size in the Bay Area? Can you imagine either the real insecurity (x)or the lack of innovation that could lead to this situation?

Except for a few managers, directors or VPs feeling free enough to behave at work in the same way than how they live, almost every engineer I have been interacting with, have shared as little as possible about their private life.
The rare exceptions of interpersonal exchange ends up around some sort of competitive behavior: Who is the most geeky, sportive, owns the fastest car/biggest house/visited the strangest place.

I've heard workaholic people complaining about ambitious peers who were over-managing, over-working to get even more work to do after. I feel like we're past workaholism at this point.

Maybe there are a lot of shy people! Maybe there is a culture of fear, not only of being fired, but also a fear of interacting with people going to be fired.
Maybe it's all in my head, maybe people giving 5 stars to their experience here don't care the human aspect of a company. And maybe they're right.

What about your crush, your fears, your desires for the future, your appetite for life? I've been blessed to work in enough large companies to know that the behavior that I'm seeing in Netflix is not a healthy one. I've also been lucky enough to work in other industries more socializing than tech and I can tell that Netflix has a lot to do on that side, and off-sites or team meeting won't solve that problem.

I am afraid about the tragic, but inevitable consequences of the ways people operate in this company: I guess that the day the worst will happen, it will be addressed in an impersonal memo by Reed; followed-up by 1 or 2 reminders during offsites. Possibly commented by HR in a Q&A document. And move on. This company seems as reactive in its management of people as it is proactive in its business operations.

I still work at Netflix though, not only for the paycheck, but because I hope. I hope it will change. The needed change can't happen from a candid feedback, a Q&A, or  only from inside.
Change has to come from everyone, including people who take time to read comments like this one. Netflix has so many good people and offers such a great service.

As a curious Netflix employee reading this review: think about your past, isn't there a big human thing that you would love to feel again in your current company that you've felt in the past?

As a candidate: think about what would be a good question to ask to that HR partner once your package is almost here to be offered to you, think about that comment you make at the end of an interview when you're being asked by an engineer: ""Do you have any question for me?""
What Netflix needs is an inception, something that anyone and everyone would think about after leaving the call or the room they were sharing with you.
Ask yourself, and then the others, the question you should ask if you think you want to spend a good amount of your life and energy in the place you're applying for.

- Will I learn and contribute to the knowledge of other's? Even outside the company?
- Will I see emotional responses from my peers? Will that be for other reasons than being fired or bluntly criticized?
- Will I find a friendly environment that will nurture my appetite for life?
- What is the amount of emotional interaction (celebrating, sharing, playing) to expect from a company whose service is the best to ""entertain""?
- Do androids dream of electric sheep?"
Netflix,1,45308,Incredibly Toxic Envrionment,HR-Ops,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"Salary and pay is good, competitive wages","There's no accountability and management is incredibly toxic. Competent employees and leaders are pushed out and others that are simply proficient at schmoozing execs are the golden standard. ICs are treated like machines - there's no work-life balance and managers that create a pervasive environment of fear are promoted. Processes and systems are a MESS because mid-managers overpromise without having any knowledge of the scope of work that needs to be delivered. ICs are forced to reconcile the gaps that management creates and are punished for trying to set realistic expectations. 

My manager specifically would say that this is a ""safe space"" and that she would be ""supportive and provide guidance when needed"" during team calls. Then, in my 1:1s, tell me that it was my responsibility to find the answers to my own questions when I had any. She would also spend most 1:1s belittling and berating me. In team calls, she would also single me out just to flip around immediately and say ""I'm not trying to single you out, BUT""

Overall, this team and her management has deflated me. If you value your mental and overall health, I would stay away. Some managers are great, however, the vast majority are similar to my own personal experience. The pay is simply not worth it."

Coworkers are fun & inclusive.","Do you like never having any federal holidays off? Do you like having an impossible work load? Do you like feeling like your goal post is constantly moving and therefore feeling like you never accomplish anything? Do you like constantly being re-orged and getting new managers multiple times a year? Do you like being told you’re not flexible enough if not? Do you like being expected to be on-call and available to work 24/7? Do you like lots of overtime and 16 hour work days not “sometimes” but on a weekly basis all year round?

Netflix,1,45135,Toxic work culture perpetuated by terrible leaders,Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Los Gatos, CA",Surrounded by incredibly talented engineers and brilliant ideas. Outstanding pay and benefits,"In a nutshell, your Netflix experience boils down to your direct manager. Managers are almighty dictators reinforcing a pervasive culture of fear at Netflix. I was originally hired by a different leader with whom I had the opportunity to connect and vet. But everything changed when I joined, my manager was someone I hadn't had a single conversation with during the hiring process. If your manager is an empathetic leader invested in your experience and growth, then read no further. But if your manager is anything like mine - a recently promoted IC with absolutely no training/experience in leadership, expect to be overly micromanaged. Expect to be humiliated and treated disrespectfully in the name of candidness over kindness. In a one-on-one conversation, my manager snapped at me when I was about to speak (I wasn't interrupting) and asked me to repeat what they just said. Expect to not have any communication for weeks on end and receive feedback out of the blue that takes you by complete surprise. Expect to have the culture memo weaponized against you. Expect to not have any allies - any attempts to move to a different team that could be a better fit will be thwarted by internal politics. Seeking help from HRBP is as futile as denying climate change. At this point my only hope is a major re-org, but I wouldn't wish this manager on anybody. Having worked in the industry for over a decade at different sized companies, I've had all kinds of managers. This is the first time I feel psychologically unsafe."

It's also always been a pretty lean company with process where it's needed but not the influence of politics and bureaucracy.

Their selling methodology es selling by selling, no focus on having the right clients with the products they need, is more like getting every client they can, by selling everything they can, without considering if the client is actually ready or needs what its being sold. 

In terms of employees, the expectations are unfair an unrealistic, disorganized changes leave clients unattended and representatives with heroic situations to save some accounts, with poorly guided and unfair blame by leadership. I encountered situation where clients did not know of products they had on their accounts, lack of contact for over a year, or requests left unattended for months.

You have the luxury to work from home and if there is an office close to your location, you can have your own flexible hybrid schedule.","1. The company has gone private which means less transparency than before. 2. Teams and workflow processes are unstructured with teams acting as separate entities using their own softwares, logos, etc.--to the detriment of cross-functional congruity. 3. Focus is more reactive than proactive, trading problem-solving and foresight for band-aid decisions, which exacerbates a vicious cycle of constant refocus on previous problems causing a “pile up” with new ones. 4. You are not set up for success. Managers incapable of providing tools and resources will chide and scold you for errors stronger management would’ve mitigated. There is also a “wild, wild, west” mentality where juniors are “on their own” until they mess up (and then, of course, it’s all their fault for doing so) and toxic competition among team members (employees trying to prove that they are “valuable” to the business by keeping work to themselves, belittling coworkers on Zoom calls, questioning others abilities behind their back, etc.). 5. Each senior/direct manager or leadership team has their own agenda, leaving you no choice but to follow suit. You’ll become “backdoor” managers of people because existing managers lack the competence to do so and the work will fall to you. On top of a ridiculous amount of managing up already required. 6. Some managers propagate a “yes man/woman” culture even when confronted with lack of resources to complete requests. This exacerbates an already daunting corporate culture towards elevating certain employees’ feelings over productivity, sensible project management, and/or actual employee support and engagement. 7. Teams can be extremely lean: employees hired for one job end up doing 2."

If you are not 1.5 hours early you're late, and if you don't stay till 7 pm or later you get in trouble for leaving early. Additionally, I was also forced to lie to future applicants that were considering accepting an offer by the company in fear of retribution for being honest about the TOXIC work environment.

So many lies. Lies in the interview process, lies to prospects and clients, lies from middle management. 

This isn't a software company. It's an M&A company with call center style salesteam. Acquire & license small companies that are doing something niche in the marketing world. Try and eventually fit it into a really massive, fragmented product offering. Get your sales army to outright harass anyone and everyone that might have had a job title somewhat related to marketing/PR/Comms within the last 15 years. Overcharge them, and make it really inconvenient for them to cancel 

Internal CRM is an absolute joke and makes things insanely complicated and difficult just to do your job.
Then they stack sales enablement tools on top, that don't sync with the CRM, which causes all sorts of issues. Then add like 15 google sheets into the mix. Just so unnecessarily complicated.

Account ownership rules are pathetic/non existent, you'll end up calling mostly sole proprietors - trying to sell them 20k worth of software they 100% don't need or want, can't afford, and likely won't buy..even when you ""discount"" it 85% at the end of the month

You essentially can bypass the several years you would need to have as an SDR/BDR at most other sales company, which is a huge plus.
-Company culture for the most part is great, especially once Covid hit. A lot of middle management and senior leadership took a step back from what had been historically the norm (strict regimented daily schedules such as ""Cold Calling Power Hour"" time blocks throughout the day, pressure to be in the office, etc) and now give significantly more leniency with how people work, especially now that most are fully remote. Leadership leading teams with more of an empathy-first mentality.
-Really great opportunity to climb the career ladder quickly, with promotions usually given every year pending sales performance and your team/culture contribution. Most start in as an entry-level individual contributor, and can be promoted into management or senior individual contributor by the next year.
-Product is sick and sells itself. Definitely clear cut leaders in the space with so many exciting innovations on the roadmap.
-Company provides a 50% 401k match, with other benefits such as ClassPass subsidized, Calm App, health/dental/vision insurance
-Work with amazing, talented people. Great networking opportunity
-Uncapped commission and great bonuses... have the opportunity to make a lot of money if you perform","Honestly only one major con, which is the pay. Like any company, Meltwater isn't perfect, so in addition to pay, below are a few things I think could be improved:

-Pay... we aren't competitive enough to recruit or retain the talent we need to continue our growth trajectory. Perhaps back in the day we could recruit new hires straight out of college, train them to be cold-calling machines and crank out one-and-done deals on the daily... and while we compensated our average/low pay by offering amazing office culture and fun monthly office events, this just doesn't cut it any more. Now that we're all remote and sky-rocketing inflation has affected many including significant increase in cost of living, we can't pay our bills with company culture. This needs to be addressed immediately.
-Since we've been WFH, it would be nice if the company offered to subsidize our WiFi or phone bills. Many tech companies began offering this as a new benefit when Covid hit.
-I think the company would benefit from hiring externally for certain leadership positions. Many mid-level and senior management are internal hires who started entry-level and were promoted from within. While this is great if you're trying to scale and grow rapidly, Meltwater is now an established 20 yr old company, and we need diversified leadership experience from individuals who have various track records (working at different SaaS companies) of successfully running large Client Success or Client Acquisitions teams in order for us to level up. I think Meltwater is too close minded in that the majority (~98%) of our senior sales leadership were internal promotions and Meltwater is the only tech sales company they've every known..."

This entails leadership changes and new visions all the time. The new foreign bosses talk about how great it's going to be, all the profits they could make, yada yada. In a year or two, Cogent is being sold to another company, rinse and repeat.
This office has some of the craziest office bureaucracy among senior managers that I've seen. The problem with a small office are the things they can get away with. They power trip in e-mails and say things in private to employees, that are fireable offenses. Who can you inform, when HR answers to them. Several teams collectively brought up the abuse with our HR and even went up the chain, and nothing ever gets done. 
There's not much invested in employees, job satisfaction, or job growth. Those who are in middle management have been there for decades, and stroke the executive's egos full time to keep their jobs. 
The projects here are interesting at first, but you will be grinding out the same type of work day in and out. R&D needs a huge overhaul for the company's future. 
The pay here is average. There is not much incentive to stay here, but depending on the team you will be worked to the bone.

Mistrust - Management and HR would say one thing then do another. 
HR told us that being an 'exempt' employee means that we would be working at least 40 hours weekly and therefor required to stay extra and work weekends; United States law defines an exempt employee much differently. 
HR promised to cover certain payments in job acceptance, then attempted to deny these expenses after hired, 
Management promised to hire more employees (after being given many resumes and resources) for nearly a year, then moved tasks to a foreign location and hired employees... found out it was planned the entire time.

If it's not your first job, but you have experience, you will definitely be expected to hit the ground running. I consider these both pros because if your experience is valued, or you have energy to burn, you will be put to use. You basically have two years to prove yourself. First year is to find your right fit and for management to assess your energy level. Second year is to see if you have adjusted to your new 'stretch goal'.

I have been fortunate to have excellent managers whom I could trust professionally and who have challenged me along the way. Many are not so fortunate, however. My direct managers are why I am still here.

Regardless of the situation, we always get the job done.","If you are looking for a dot.com rocket ride or most everything that the tech journals/press laud about ""high tech"" companies, keep looking. Things are fast-paced because everything is understaffed. Always. Managers are selected early in their careers, groomed and promoted. That's not to say that this doesn't work well-enough in general, however, if you're 7-8 years in and not yet a manager, you won't be. HR ""career advancement"" is a joke. I've never seen anyone, other than management, switch verticals (e.g. from telecom to M-2-M, or any other vertical) successfully. Promotion is usually up or out.

If your manager is in France (most are, once you reach a certain level) you will be competing against the locals over there for resources and time/energy/interest from your manager. It's only natural, but it's terrible professionally. Your manager, and his/her (most are men) respect level from their manager have a tremendous impact on your ability to make an impact for the company.

And as for ""getting the job done, regardless of the circumstances"" - this quickly leads to burnout, because lessons are rarely learned by the organization. Rinse, repeat."

Gemalto,2,43144,Awful Management and Understaffed,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"Gemalto has quite many great employees that work tirelessly to yield great results with the little that they have. They put in long hours, attend early morning pointless meetings, and work late in to the night “until we get more people.” Management doesn’t often recognize the efforts of those that are not in the upper echelon, but you will find peers that will look out for your wellbeing. This is actually the strongest point of this company. The employees really band together and try to make the best with what they have. You will make friends easily and look forward to seeing them each day.
If you have a fondness for travel or working with people from all over the world, you will feel just at home in Gemalto. You will likely need to coordinate with multiple international teams, and have meetings with your manager, who will be located in France. If you are lucky or are in a more sales role, you will get to enjoy more international travel.
Since Gemalto doesn’t compete very well in the USA market, internal recruitment is pretty good. You can jump up diagonally or horizontally quite easily. This is great for gaining experience in a field that you thought would have been locked away professionally behind several years of experience in a different company. 

Health care and dental are really good. Wish I had given birth or broken a bone while I was on their plan.","The upper most management and HR are not dependable or trustable. Great HR people will eventually leave the company, leaving behind a slew of yes-men. You will have some one promoted over you quite quickly because they are friends with the right person. The company wasn’t like this long ago, but that’s the turn that it took in late 2016, going in to 2017.
You will find some good managers on the low levels, but it is rare. What you will encounter is a management culture that is much more focused on their personal gain than your place in the company. You will find managers that block your opportunities to move around to other teams or are unwilling to give you the raise that you deserve. It is unfortunate that this company refuses to try and retain their talent.
You will never get enough people on your team. Since this company keeps losing good talent, you will always be doing the job of 2 employees or more. Even when they hire more talent, it is only a matter of time till your next team member leaves.

Most people are underpaid."

I enjoy going to work every day and like everyone in the office. There are a lot of very nice people working here.

The flexibility is great. If i have an errand to run, I can leave the office if work permits and go do it. No problem! 

401K matching and (sometimes) stock purchase benefits are available.","If you speak French, you have it made at Gemalto. If you are American, you will be lucky if you ever get in management. There are a few VP level American managers at our office, most are French. However, they are men. If you are a lady, your chances of getting into management are in the ""miracle"" category. 

Along these lines, at Gemalto you are probably working for a French person. Many times this person is actually in France. This is problematic, because your French manager will provide resources and time to the people he sees in front of him... in France. You are in the US, so you will often draw the short straw. Objectives are written in broken English, so may be difficult to understand. Phone calls and emails from your manager may be equally as cryptic. 

It is very difficult to get a raise at Gemalto. Definitely negotiate what you want at the get go. There will be low and few increases after you join.

Hard work is not rewarded. You are always told that you were ""expected"" to do the things you do, even if you work insanely hard on things that are not in your objectives. This goes back to above, low raises. Perhaps they don't want to give you credit for your work, or else they may have to give you a raise. 

If you need a pat on the back for your good work, this is not the place for you. You will probably only get feedback if there is an issue that needs modification.

It is hit and miss as far as management goes. You could be lucky and get a good manager, but most of the managers are promoted for being great developers, and are not the best managers. 

There is a lot of politics going on. It is not conducive to good teamwork. It is kind of an every man for himself type atmosphere. Your manager's top priority is looking good. If you are one of those people who likes to come to the office and work and go home, get ready to learn about politics!"
Gemalto,2,42309,Career stagnation,Personalization Engineer/Software Developer,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","Montgomeryville, PA","Good pay and benefits, fairly flexible schedule.","Micro-managing. Boxing: you are put in a ""box"" in the sense that you are expected to work on the same domain for years on end. Unwillingness to allow development teams to have ownership of their product domain, thus leading to employees feeling dis-empowered, demotivated, lacking passion for their work, and rampant (justified) cynicism towards management initiatives. This is a 9-to-5 environment where nobody really cares much about what they do, they just do it because it pays the bills. Zero innovation unless you work at the Gemenos, France office because every new idea must be vetted by Corporate managers, and when good ideas are presented they are often taken and repackaged by Corporate R&D, leaving engineers at satellite offices with no recognition. Extremely difficult to move within the company if you're not a ""yes man"" who never questions the status quo. Very high employee turnaround due to the reasons above and intense internal politics and bureaucracy. You may thrive in this environment if you are a social butterfly who's good at navigating the bureaucracy and play your cards right. But then you're probably not a great engineer. And the problem is that the top is full of the aggressive corporate ladder climbers who got there by stepping on their peers, and those people will be your managers. Expect unreasonable deadlines, nonsensical requirements, superfluous projects designed to pad some project manager's resume, time consuming tracking of developer time down to the hour (yes, even full-time salaried software engineers must produce detailed reports of how they spent their time), among other nonsense.

Being a French company, everything of French origin gets precedence: French nationals enjoy very generous expatriate contracts to work overseas, a disproportionate amount of internal third-party software solutions are of French origin despite the fact that they are often considerable inferior and more expensive than leading providers. 

One last thing that really bother me is the extensive use of open source software internally without any kind of contribution back to the FLOSS community. When Gemalto can't find a French company to provide some service, they will grab an open source solution, customize it, and deploy it internally world-wide. All while not allowing employees to make any contributions to those projects as a matter of company policy (some exceptions exist, mostly employees who have developed solutions in their own personal time)."
Gemalto,2,42338,Job growth but at a high cost,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,"Belcamp, MD","If you want to do different things in your career, Gemalto encourages you to take different positions and will pay for you to move (within country or internationally). Quite often, this means taking positions in areas where you have no background or expertise. (For instance, they are quite happy to move someone from a VP of Operations to a VP of Marketing.) They also strongly encourage internal transfer and promotion, which means there's a real career ladder at Gemalto. Excellent benefits, including generous PTO, decent health care plans, and exceptional life insurance.","Gemalto spends less than half the industry average on marketing, making it challenging to get in front of customers. Leadership is focused exclusively on how profitable the company is from year to year, rather than competitiveness or leadership over the long term. Gemalto does not allow you to be re-hired; if you leave, you are gone permanently, even if you are a better and cheaper options than other candidates. It's difficult to get rid of underperforming employees, even if they do damage to the business. Gemalto does not pay for any training or education outside of their own programs. Gemalto caps their maximum pay at the 50th percentile for the region, making hiring qualified outside people very difficult (and results in pretty poor compensation).

Recently we were given a sheet of magnets that have our 8 objectives and incentives for employees. Allow me to expand on them, this may give you more insight to working here.

Diversity: Very much true. There are a lot of people from France here, however (it is a French company), and it seems like they get preferential treatment. I've never worked in an office in the US where I've seen such an array of different cultures, origins and beliefs.

Ethics & Community: More or less.

Compensation and Benefits: The compensation is OK. Nothing special for market rates. Benefits, though, are good. For everyone I've worked for thus far, Gemalto's healthcare and 401k are unbeatable.","Management by Objectives: Every company says this. They never do. It's a way to satisfy upper management who are disconnected with what the workers accomplish.

Recruitment: Gemalto has a joke of a recruitment policy. For starters, unless you have a Bachelor's degree or higher? Don't even bother talking to them. It is an absolute requirement, and a silly one. I've interviewed people who have the perfect skill sets that we need, and because of that one little piece of paper, they aren't even considered.

Promotion from Within: To management only. And it's all poltical rather than based on merit. People who have worked in the same position for multiple years without raises or promotions, despite being exceptional members of a team.

Training: A joke. There is no training. Even if you jump up and down screaming at senior management, showing all of the flaws of your job because of the lack of training, not a thing will be done about it.

Mobility: Yes, if you like working in other countries. If you are looking to work in the town you live in, where your home and family are, you will get nowhere. If you are willing to change countries of citizenship every 2 years there are plenty of opportunities."

Large company so the possibility of being acquired is low.,"Not really a tech company.  Their products are all acquisitions.  The company then turns around, trains someone making much less money and lays off the engineers and support staff responsible for creating the product.  The result is techs and support staff who aren't too knowledgeable in the product they support.  Not only is this frustrating to the support engineers but think of how the clients must feel!

The IT staff for the most part is 90% outsourced.  Unqualified and overpaid it's easy to say if you have the slightest problem with your computer you might as well just reinstall your operating system before it actually gets fixed.  The remaining 10% are incompetent.   No one has an original idea or wants to make the company or processes better. People are content just to come into work and collect a paycheck.

The company is French based, so get used to being wrong all the time.  As stated earlier there are no original ideas just acquired companies that knew what they were doing.

You get the ability to learn new skills, but it's often at the cost of the company performance and the hatred from your peers.  You have 10 years of experience in software development?  Let's put you in a manager role of HR.  You are a senior Finance member?  We have the perfect position for you in R&D.  If you happen to get promoted from a senior member to a management role you get the additional privilege of learning out how much more your pervious peers make more then you.  Yes, make.  HR won't do a thing, as far as they are concerned this is what you agreed on so who cares if the people under you make more.  You should feel privileged to be promoted."

I am speaking in general with reference to the entire division, I worked closely to many departments during my time there- although working there, I did meet a few capable and intelligent folks along the way, although they too tend to stay a very short time, go figure.","This review is specific to Gemalto Cogent and let me start by saying, this company has so much potential for real extraordinary growth, however with current management, leaders, and even supervisors this place will not succeed. Not to mention HR, this is by far the worst HR, I have ever encountered, like other post before mine, this company DOES not invest in you as a person nor in your professional growth, and they say they do, but actions do not relay such statements. 

I have been with the company for about 2+ years, and although Gemalto recently took over, they have kept most, if not all the same staff from past company 3M Cogent along with that companies fad and mentality (old habits).

This company does keep people for many years like 16+ years, and mind you, I have no idea why? Many past meetings have been useless, unproductive, and sometimes with the same agenda on a weekly basis- causing counter production and unnecessary waste of useful time. My past post, kept me busy, I had a lot of work, I was overworked and in an understaffed department. For some reason (Management) a few departments had a high turn around, this was due to unprofessional, rude, and unbearable Managers, to the point where they will scream to staff in front of everyone, and for the most part it was for small matters that could have been addressed without an encounter. HR is best friends with the Managers that have been unprofessional, so there are some sacred cows there. Also, specifically my department had a high turn around, not only in staff but management, in my time there, I had many managers- who I had to train all to simply change policy due to “I know it best mentality”, this places only constant was change, and although change is good, it is not good when they keep hiring unqualified and inexperienced managers.

I have so much to say,  my statement is not to deter you from applying but simply and honest response to the factual experience I had with this company. But, honestly if you need the gig, then go for it, only do not expect it to be a good fit, and always have a contingency plan ahead, and obviously be prepared, you never know, maybe a new company will take it over and have all new management. These companies tend to change constantly, they are in it for the money, not the business and therefor not its people.

At some point I meet with some hierarchies, and had some real hopes for this place, and although things wont change in a matter of months, but thus far the changes that did take place, only made the matters worse."

Higher level management (sr. VP and above) seems disconnected from lower level workers and are looking out for their own interest
Not enough company wide events, and when they do happen, seem cheap and badly put together
There are some SERIOUSLY underwhelming people working here on all teams, whom I have no idea how they got hired in the first place.

They won't replace people in my department when they leave, so we are now doing 2x the work with 1/2 the number of people.

Although the schedule is flexible, I often have to be available for meetings early in the morning or late at night because the development team is in India and China.

Layoffs are frequent and with no communication. It's frustrating to be working on a project with someone, have them not show up to a meeting, only to find out that they have been laid off. This has happened more than once!

The performance review process is a joke. Self assessments have no bearing on grade, and bonuses/raises are not given fairly. Profit sharing used to include everyone in the company, but now only goes to some employees based on review grade.

The work ethic and integrity of most individual contributors is exceptional despite the ridiculous burden of work placed upon them due to layoffs.,"The apparent greed and averous of the executive management is disgusting.  They have shown monumental short sightedness in most of their recent business decisions.  They have been completely reactionary to the competition and have been outmaneuvered at every point since taking over in '08.  Xilinx presently has over 30 VPs or higher and more than 180 Directors or higher showing that the ratio of Senior Management to individual contributors is skewed to a nonsensical extreme.

Xilinx is acting like a start up in asking/pushing employees to put in very long hours to make up for the reduction in staff after two sizable layoffs.  This might be reasonable if employees believed management had some intelligent plan for the future but no such plan has been communicated.  There is little prospect of reward for the extra effort being demanded.

When the economy improves I predict a mass exodus from Xilinx US, and Europe.  This is probably what Moshe is wanting so he can move more jobs to India and Singapore."

Sharp engineers, helpful peers, a willingness to see the company's products succeed in spite of the incompetent senior management and critically bad morale.
2) Unless you're part of the executive staff, you're not actually forced to listen to Moshe speak in person.  He seems to prefer to hide from the ""common folk"".","With maybe one or two exceptions, the new senior management team are scary-bad, with the scariest and baddest at the top.  It’s truly amazing how some people get the jobs that they do...  Compassion, morale, open communication, and anything resembling the previous corporate values have flown out the door, and the bottom line is now absolute king - which may not even sound that bad to some people, but the problem is these clowns are demonstrating they have absolutely no clue how to get there.  Somehow slashing long-time employees, and throwing away EVERYTHING that existed before they got here, isn't working.  Huh.  Go figure.  Maybe the stock will finally go up after they've outsourced all of the jobs except for their own to India and Singapore?   I'm guessing that's their next move..."

However, under the previous management team, continuous improvement was not something encouraged unless one of a few select individuals wanted it to happen.
Morale is ok (but not good) in some groups but is very low in other groups especially those that have a lot of 15+ year employees.  For the most part, they don't like what they see and don't think it will get any better.
If the job market was better, attrition would be much higher, and when the market turns, don't stand by the door because you'll get run over.  The stock used to keep employees at Xilinx, it hasn't done much in recent years and the majority of stock options are under water.

The bottom line is the new bottom line.  Every decision is now made for maximizing short-term profitability at the expense of what appears to be the long-term health of the company.   Excellent, talented, and very experienced engineers are constantly being let go from North America and Europe, and their jobs are being replaced in India and Singapore (usually in the name of being cost-efficient).

New management arrived in January, 2008 and still seems to be working on developing a strategy for growth.  Granted the sudden recent economic events have not made that easy but management is also unusually invisible and non-communicative or opaque about the future.  Most recent pronouncements have been schizophrenic in proclaiming both that we have the most advanced technology, the best solutions, we are positioned for stellar growth and that the market is doomed and we are destined to collapse with it.

Also, the work involves public safety systems and must be done right. Both of these can place a lot of pressure on everyone. So it is important that you like what you do and also that you take time for yourself when possible to prevent burnout. (There is a very good paid time off policy.)"
Motorola Solutions,4,45274,An Acceptable Employer,Writer,"Former Employee, more than 10 years",,"They offer benefits competitive with other companies in the same industry. They provide the tools required to complete the job. They have a good stock purchase program. They have 401K matching up to a certain percentage that is competitive with other companies.

If you inherit a terrible territory good luck. You won’t discover this until it’s too late. Long sales cycle (12-18 mos) with no ramp or guaranteed commissions while building territory. There won’t be any opportunities to cherry pick. Better have money in your savings account to cover this deficit or you’ll regret it.
Motorola Solutions,5,45313,Love the MSI Family,Senior Systems Architect,Current Employee,,"Flexibility, collaboration, innovation, responsive and caring managment",large org you get lost in the sauce easy. siloed skills and understanding of various product streams. Every one goes for the throne so its a constant battle of newcomers and established competitors. The pace is steady and unrelenting. You must thrive in those conditions if you will be engineering or sales sided.  I like it but i have seen new blood burn out in less than 2 years or take things personal when its just the cadence we operate in. Be humble and self motivated and this con will become a strength.

The people were a joy to work around and very driven. The teams had great cohesion and worked well together. As long as you're working hard, giving effort, the likelihood of a promotion or receiving merit is high. Unlimited PTO is a very nice benefit if you remember to use it and Motorola offers a 401K which they match your contributions. Working remote is fairly flexible depending on your manager.",High workload with no relief offered by management although aware of the high workload. The pay is far below what you would expect for market rate. Compensation is based off of a national average instead of localizing the pay based off your reporting office location. This type of policy will cripple your base salary returns if you are working in-office within a larger scale city. Products that are being pushed out are nowhere near maturity but sales are forced.

They are falling behind on pay transparency, equality and talent retention. Unlimited PTO & training courses alone will not offset the pay issues, low or no growth career-wise when there are so many in leadership leaving for better offers. This creates a ‘recover/catch up/reprioritize with new replacement leader’ the support departments are cycling through 4 years now. They can’t keep up with the people that are leaving and burn out is still occurring at all levels of management & support. I am less motivated to go above & beyond when we constantly see new hires coming in at much higher rates that many of us could easily be worth more leaving for the same role elsewhere. This isn’t a new issue by any means, but it was an aging model before Covid and post-Covid it’s a downright ancient practice with much higher rates and exacerbated by the constant replacement leadership. The only thing keeping me here is the schedule flexibility & remote options. My child is getter older so it’s not going to be a motivator much longer."

The company continues to experience strong growth, but there are significant challenges, particularly in the supply chain. There are certain departments and teams that offer better work environments than others. The ""unlimited PTO"" is nice, although you need to work for a manager & department that embrace taking PTO to fully take advantage of this. The Employee Stock Purchase Program (ESPP) is a nice perk to have access to. The 401K matching rate is fairly competitive.  Most teams are still very flexible with remote work, which is very convenient.  There were no required weekly days in the office when I left.","Heavy workload placed upon individuals in supply chain, tedious & manual job activities, lower than industry average pay, and a lack of gratitude for the hard work of supply chain individual contributors from certain senior leaders and members of the sales team. Supply Chain seems to operate in a constant state of chaos. Some areas of supply chain do not embrace taking PTO, which leads to high burnout levels among employees. Annual bonus growth seems to have stagnated post-Covid. Annual raises are consistently very low. It is very hard to be promoted within supply chain. However, lateral ""rotations"" are frequently offered. There is a lack of transparency, honesty, and integrity between some supply chain people leaders and their individual contributor employees."

- Unless you are looking for retirement or are sure you will be in this company on all causes, this is not a company you want to stay long for simply because your skills relevant to what most companies need will be obsolete.

- if it is fine with you and you decide to stick around and see what you can pick up, while the products are mostly defined and there are no actual real initiatives that matter, the time people have will be on playing politics (guys, it is not worth your years of contribution be involved in politics that brings you to no-where)"

I don't feel like anyone really cares about my development or me as a person, but maybe this is just my team (no one has ever really asked how i'm doing, how i feel in the role, etc.) which makes it hard to feel engaged at work. no real emphasis on career progression and development, just the day-to-day client work. unlimited PTO can feel like a scam, as people brag about not taking time off so you feel pressured to not take off and don’t have the excuse to “use up” your vacation days. the lack of senior leadership doesn't help culture and morale. can feel like a ""drink the kool aid and don't question it"" culture which makes improvement more difficult."

Senior management casts blame at developer when process is the issue, yet they offer no solutions other than ""do better."" They dodge questions instead of admitting they don't have an answer.

SAS is swimming up a waterfall trying to stay competitive. They are far too slow to deliver software and refuse to drop parasitic customers that refuse to upgrade from legacy products. Too much time is wasted in development keeping outdated code alive and in setting priorities, because everything is ""top priority."" 

SAS used to be one of the best places to work, but the times have drastically changed. Senior management is shortsighted, idealistic, and out of touch. The company has a lot - and I mean a lot - of work to do before they can claim to be competitive in the market and as an employer."

They make snap decisions to participate in a vertical and then take none of the steps required to make their offering compliant or competitive.
SAS,2,45101,Wait and see on IPO,Employee,Current Employee,,"Possible IPO, some very nice colleagues","Supposedly there will be an IPO and supposedly employees will benefit too. But it only came about when the founders and owners of the company failed to agree on price when they tried to sell SAS a couple of years ago. These same leaders waxed on over the years about how valuable employees were, only to try and sell the company to another company known for gutting their acquisitions and laying people off. I’m a very long term employee and I truly used to believe SAS was the best place to work. I bragged and felt lucky to work at SAS, but those feelings are completely gone. I’m just waiting now to see what happens. I don’t hold out much hope that employees will be treated well. What a sad end to what could have been a great legacy. I’m no fool, I’ll take the money (I’ve earned it after all the years of working well over the “35 hour work week” on non-competitive pay rates), but I’ll never forget the betrayal of employees by senior management."
SAS,4,45026,"Great Work-Life Balance, But Limited Growth Opportunities",Software Tester,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Cary, NC","Impressive Work-Life Balance: One of the most striking aspects of working at SAS is the excellent work-life balance. The company genuinely values the well-being of its employees and encourages a healthy lifestyle. Flexible hours, remote work options, and a supportive management team all contribute to an enjoyable and stress-free work environment. Wonderful Teammates: The camaraderie and support provided by my colleagues at SAS have been exceptional. Team members are friendly, helpful, and committed to working collaboratively. The positive atmosphere fostered by my coworkers has made coming to work each day a pleasure.","Below-Average Compensation: While the work-life balance is certainly a highlight, the compensation package at SAS leaves much to be desired. Salaries are not competitive with industry standards, making it difficult to feel truly valued for the work we put in. This could lead to a higher turnover rate as employees seek better-paying opportunities elsewhere. Limited Transferable Skills: Unfortunately, the nature of the work at SAS does not provide many opportunities for employees to develop transferable skills. The tasks can be repetitive, and the learning curve tends to plateau after a short time. This may hinder professional growth and make it challenging to transition into new roles or industries."

SAS offers a variety of unique perks and benefits to employees, but favorites include the option of a PPO medical plan and onsite Health Care Center, hybrid work, generous PTO (including a company shutdown between Christmas and New Year's) and subsidized onsite cafés. Beyond the perks, there’s ample opportunity for internal mobility and career development, and my managers have been exceptionally supportive – not just of me as an employee, but as a whole person.

Some advertised benefits are almost impossible to get, and there is little transparency on whether you'll get them when you apply. Pay is significantly below local market, but that's obscured by the job title game. You are grouped into job titles that may not reflect the position you applied to or work you are doing. Moving up is political versus based on ability or contributions. If you get a great boss, it could be a great job, but bad managers are protected and complaints through proper channels can lead to being listed as a no rehire. Most tech companies have equivalent or better benefits. Some changes are very heavy handed and communicated horribly,  but are sometimes reversed when there significant complaints. The company rewards talkers over doers.  Not as friendly to diversity as it was historically.  Some people get mocked over salaries or English speaking ability"

Working in SMB Hospitality, the teams really cared about restaurants and did their best. Managers were open to feedback and very supportive. Restaurant technology is a fun industry.","The biggest challenge for the NCR SMB Hospitality is aging technology. NCR Aloha was the clear market leader a decade ago but the resources were not invested to keep it current. This is resulting in much of the SMB market going to Toast.

Also, the support and billing were moved overseas. These people are nice but often aren't properly trained. This leads to very angry customers over long support holds and duplicate billing. They are trying to make NCR Silver (Aloha Cloud) the future but it needs much more investment to catch up with competitors (like Toast & Square).

All that being said, I enjoyed my time at NCR because of the people. There is still a place for NCR in larger chains. If you only have restaurant experience and want to get a corporate business job, this is a great place to start."
NCR,2,45327,"Sales-Focused, not Execution Focused",Account Support Manager,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","Raleigh, NC",Many great coworkers and friends I’ve made over the years. First line management is also generally pretty good and grounded.,"This company is run by people who are career salesmen. And sales is all that they care about. This is reflected in almost all levels of the culture. Sales teams are often (and exclusively even) given the best perks and benefits, and are almost always the only ones being recognized by executive leadership on the all-hands calls. 

Meanwhile NCR invests laughably little (about 3%) into innovating the vast array of legacy products it constantly misrepresents as being cutting edge, and the actual newer products are also often years ahead of being working and viable solutions, but are sold anyways.

Execution and delivering on promises to customers is a distant second priority. That is until this rush to the sale’s finish line mantra complicates another sales opportunity, and leadership will then throw all hands on deck to (temporarily) fix said problem to keep the customer on the sales hook.

You will constantly hear executive leadership saying “the customers are first”. It’s all nonsense. What they really mean is “the sales pipeline is first”. And these aren’t just my words, at least three high level customer contacts (c-suite and director) have told me this same thing over the years."

They are some truly awesome people in Omaha that you trauma bond with.,"The leadership within Omaha leaves much to be desired. It’s very top down and many people have left the company because of one leader in particular, yet nothing will change because the leadership group goes way back prior to D3. They have very unrealistic expectations of Product Owners, and don’t clearly communicate those expectations until it’s a problem. I left because the work life balance was not good, the leadership said you should be a full SME within 3-6 months, but would change the span of ownership every over month. It was very hectic and if they felt you weren’t keeping up or asked too many questions, you were labeled as incompetent by one leader and she made sure you were aware of it. 
This leader also disregarded any type of Covid restriction the company put in place because she was vocally anti-vax."
NCR,1,45334,Dishonest and poor management,Customer Engineer II,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Chicago, IL",You are provided with a fleet vehicle almost feels as if you're running your own business with inventory and break/fix calls.,Dishonest management very disrespectful when you are asking for something as simple as weekends off. A specific person on the management team made sexually abusive remarks and was not fired or reprimanded at all. Management was covering up for this person and nothing ever happened.

We all did our best despite the workload becoming more and more as people get let go and no backfill. 

There is quite the building of comradery as we suffer together.","This company sets you up for failure. It is sink or swim here, and it is most common for people to be drowning. Terrible communication, zero training, and no documentation.

I stupidly worked extremely long hours because it was urgent. Nothing is ever urgent when everything is urgent.

I had very inadequate managers, project managers, and coworkers. Most of my team was abroad. They were absolutely incompetent and liars. There were a few star developers sprinkled in. Many had no idea what they were doing and constantly pushed out bad code. They didn't like when I pointed out their problems. It meant they had eyes on them. I've experienced them lying about them doing work. They couldn't possibly do work if their lab wasn't up and connected.

I feel bad for the good ones who worked long hours and weekends."

In just 3 years I've gone through 3 VP's of Sales and 3 Sales Managers. Over 200% turnover on my team of 20 people and to date nobody is still employed that I worked with. I was literally the Last of the Mohicans. NCR does not have their stuff together and the recently just outsourced (1.5 years ago) all of their internal processes and sales support to other countries like Siberia. It takes over a week to get quotes approved and management has no idea what their doing. Stay away from NCR unless you really like having extra doses of stress.
