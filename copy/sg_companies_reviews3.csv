Not bad pay"
EPAM Systems,2,13-Dec-23,Solid fundamentals hobbled by over-management and fixation on growth,Experience Consultant,Former Employee,"Newtown, PA","Global cross-functional team working on diverse set of business challenges that is rooted in software delivery ethos. Genuinely adept, kindhearted folks from varied cultures and backgrounds at the practitioner level. Corporate responsibility to geopolitical events is noteworthy for its clarity and integrity.","Massively distributed talent base ultimately controlled by account managers who have insane amounts of control over more experienced practitioners. Lots of communication yet everything is opaque to most employees. Highly siloed and cliquish. Senior management is well-intentioned but not addressing structural issues which is leading to a focus on shiny-object syndrome versus deliver excellence. Struggles to take cross-functional integration seriously which puts downward pressure on practitioners to manufacture opportunities with zero authority and minimal agency which works exceptionally well for a handful of folks who’ve been there for a long time or have plum positions that they protect viciously. Project work is often never aligned to skill set as much as who likes you or does not. Career development is an afterthought, especially for more specialized or senior folks. Pay and benefits are average. Layoffs happen suddenly and quietly with no warning yet aren’t fully acknowledged by the business internally or externally. This undermines senior leadership accomplishments and furthers a cultural mindset of mistrust and scarcity."

There are constant reorgs, new priorities and initiatives, and continuous asks to keep cutting costs. ALL promotions and headcount increases have been denied for over a year citing budget constraints. All year there have been silent layoffs with no announcement which has created a very high level of anxiety among remaining employees. Requirement to be back in the office at least 50% of the time and one designated week per quarter despite overwhelming employee feedback.

Pretty good learning opportunities to with access to latest tech in infra space.,Job stability is decent but rumors of layoffs and occasional contractor or job post freezing can be a tad unsettling.

It's been a journey filled with ups and downs, and I'd like to share my perspective. Let's start with the positives. If you're fortunate enough to have a good manager, consider yourself lucky. They can be your guiding light in an organization that often seems to have lost its way. However, the management style in general tends to lean heavily towards micromanagement, which can be stifling and counterproductive at times. It's hard to thrive when you constantly feel like someone is looking over your shoulder, pushing you for more, even when you're already outperforming your peers. One of the most significant issues I've observed is the sheer number of initiatives the company pursues simultaneously. While ambition is admirable, it often feels like a scattered approach, where resources and attention are spread too thin. It can be challenging to excel in an environment where you're expected to juggle so many tasks, and it sometimes feels like a lack of clear direction. Furthermore, there's been a noticeable shift in the company's priorities. We used to have a budget allocated for partner meetings and in-office engagement, which contributed to a sense of camaraderie and motivation. However, that's no longer the case, despite the company's financial success. It's disheartening to see such perks vanish when the company is more prosperous than ever. It leaves employees feeling undervalued and disconnected from the company's overall success. In conclusion, working for this company has been a mixed experience. The presence of a good manager can make all the difference, but the prevailing micromanagement style, an overwhelming number of initiatives, and the loss of budget for partner meetings and in-office engagement have made the journey a challenging one. The company seems to be in transition, and it remains to be seen whether these changes will lead to a more positive work environment in the future."

Expedia Group,3,13-Sep-23,"Great people, short-sighted management",Technical Writer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Seattle, WA",#NAME?,"Pay is lower than you would expect compared to other tech companies. I was never really given an honest-to-goodness onboarding experience, opting for a ""sink or swim"" approach where I was just immersed in the work and trusted to figure it out. As a result, I never learned basic things like ""how do I found out who to talk to about X?"", and was later chastised for not knowing these things when I hadn't been given any guidance. Expectations are often unclear; when I asked about criteria for promotion, I was provided a very vague skills matrix, but told that ""this is going to change soon, so don't get too hung up on it"". It was ""going to change soon"" for six months, and I never saw it change. I would often not find out that I had missed the mark somewhere or was not meeting an expectation until a month or more after the fact, which it is much harder to adjust and correct. When I raised to my manager that I felt some of these things were coming out of the blue, I was told ""we've been having these conversations consistently"" about topics that had literally never come up in any of our conversations. When I tried to raise this concern up the chain I was told ""well, communication is complicated"" and not given any assurances anything would be done about it after my departure. EG is pushing an absolutely non-sensical Return to Office policy: even if none of your teammates or none of the people who requisition work from your team are based in your location, you are still expected to come into the office 50% of the time. That 50% seems to be an entirely arbitrary number picked out of the air to please shareholders, not based in any kind of analysis or fact. This wouldn't be so bad if the office was actually a good place to work, but the office culture is severely lacking in organization or basic etiquette. Desks and chairs are ergonomically awful, with 80% of them facing directly toward exterior windows so glare is a constant issue. Desks are first-come first-serve during the day so if you don't arrive bright and early you are stuck with a non-adjustable desk that means you're uncomfortable all day long. Despite the existence of conference rooms and phone booths, people often take Zoom calls right from their desk, including two people at side by side desks jumping into the same Zoom call. This is a common occurrence because, as a global company, even if everyone on a team is in AN office, they won't be in the SAME office, so they're conducting all their business remotely anyway. The end result is doing the same work you do at home, in a less comfortable desk, with worse equipment, and more distractions. Of course, nobody wore a mask as of early 2023, and you would get weird looks in the halls for wearing one. Exceptions to the in-office policy are only given out for physical health reasons, and even then mostly only on a temporary basis. If you don't wish to come into the office for mental health reasons (to say nothing of the basic practicality as outlined above), the official company line is ""see a therapist and suck it up"". This is to say nothing of the fact that in October of 2022 they removed any kind of vaccination requirement to come into the office, so you can't even trust that the people around you are vaccinated against COVID. Leadership seems to be charging through all of this with oblivious aplomb. When the office first opened, Peter Kern released a message to employees telling them that it was option, and if anyone didn't want to come in for any reason (including ""You're just not comfortable doing it""), you would not be made to. At some point this message was quietly discarded, and the policy changed from 50% to ""50%, not counting Monday and Friday"". Eventually ""Expedia Weeks"" were instituted, where a week every quarter would require everyone to come in all five days. This resulted in chaos, long lines for all food and drink options, and special events that could not handle this capacity. No collaboration or increased productivity took place, but leadership smiled and insisted it was a success. Every candid conversation I had with a fellow employee made it clear that these policies are wildly unpopular with everyone except the highest level of management or those who have thoroughly drank the Kool-Aid. The result is an environment where I don't feel like my needs are taken into account whatsoever."

My demotion actually displaced me from product to operations and when I asked HR what my path back to PM would be (since this is what i was hired for, i was doing very well at it, and i also did not want to do operations) they told me i'd have to wait for another PM position to open and apply and interview like everyone else.

If you have a good manager it can be an amazing experience.,Do not believe what they are selling that they care about you as a person. Indeed only cares about one thing..money. The recent layoffs should be proof of that. For years I was under the belief they cared about employees mental health and then I started to see through it. If you have a bad quarter or two..then you are a liability to the company. Micro management is huge here and they make you hit stupid metrics even if you are pacing to hit your goal. Indeed only surfacely cares about their employees well being but deep down is just like every other corporation where profits are more important than people..and you know it. Yes you make good money here but I was miserable and management was disgusting and played favorites pretty clearly and it really impacts mental health. I make less elsewhere but am much more happy.

The culture right now is different from when I last worked (so I'm told) but historically has been very employee-centric. So much so that I found it to be a bit over the top in some situations. Salary is competitive, benefits are top notch, Indeed is looking for a certain class of employee. You need the at least the minimum experience level, a willingness to work as many hours as required to complete tasks on a deadline and some interview magic to have a shot here.  That's just to get you in, staying in means validating your quarterly of semi-annual performance with self-provided performance reviews.","The hours worked by myself (and my team) were somewhat astronomical. Weekends are the time you're either on-call or use the time to develop your skills, not watch Football or practice your putts on the course. It's a massive commitment being a part of Indeed operations teams.  Most of my coworkers handled this a lot better than I did, I think.

Different departments have their own KPIs to work towards but the KPIs across the different departments do not align. This causes friction within the teams and it is so frustrating. The culture at Indeed has deteriorated tremendously over the year, probably due to the layoffs and also how the management is micro managing every single one in the team. The director at Indeed is emotional and spreads her negativity to the people in the office.

Wrong. It's the same thing. I was told that I would need to pay a reinstatement fee to resume it, some states cost more to do so. I was hoping to keep my license active. Also, the trainings are way too long, there are 4 trainers who gossip about certain employees they don't like, one told me they spread malicious lies about me which is cause for a sexual harassment claim. Furthermore, the information is false, but they don't care. I found I was missing 14 hours of pay over two pay periods and called their ""Peoples Solutions"" line only to be told, after speaking to several people about it, that the Training Sales Manager has to put in the ticket to fix it. Are you kidding me? This is absurd. These remote call center jobs are all ""woke"" virtue signaling those with differing views from their own. I may get terminated after this review, but I'll be at peace knowing I did something right to help thousands, if not millions, of other employees who go thru there revolving door."

I thought it was one of the best jobs I ever had. I worked on the American Express project. The pay is great and the workload is a joke. You can sit for such a long time waiting on a call while still getting paid. There is a heavy turnover of agents so they are always hiring.,None of the managers could explain the bonus structure. They never talked about it in training and you were lucky to ever qualify for it. I had two managers who could not tell me how to make my calls better so I could qualify for the bonus. Then one day I was moved to a third TL without notice. She tried to help me but I was done at that time. They scare you during training to think if you do the wrong thing you will get fired. Then you do what you are trained to do and they suspend you and fire you anyway. Schedules are not that great either. You get to shift bid a schedule so you will never get the schedule you want.

If you are up-trained to a new role/skill, they will rarely offer additional pay, but when they do it is only considered “bonus pay” that is applied separately and not qualified for overtime pay (only $0.50-$1hr more max). Team members who are “promoted” to a salary supervisor position end up working 50-60hr weeks and make less than what they made as an hourly employee who was being compensated for overtime.

Concentrix,1,45251,ASTOUNDING,L2 Technical Support Engineer,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Kuala Lumpur,"Honestly, none that anyone could think of except for - Trust the reviews

My tenure at Concentrix has been marked by a series of disappointments and frustrations that I feel compelled to share for the benefit of prospective employees.

From the outset, the lack of effective communication within the organization has been glaring. Important updates and information seem to vanish into thin air, leaving employees bewildered and hindered in their work. The absence of clear guidance from leadership only adds to the confusion, making it challenging to navigate daily tasks.

The company culture at Concentrix is regrettably uninspiring. Morale is notably low, and the atmosphere lacks the camaraderie and teamwork one would hope for in a professional setting. There's a palpable sense of indifference that permeates the workplace, making it difficult to feel motivated or engaged.

Technologically speaking, Concentrix falls short of contemporary standards. Outdated systems and tools hinder productivity rather than supporting it. It's perplexing to witness a company of this size and stature neglecting the importance of investing in modern technologies to streamline operations.

Equally concerning is the apparent disregard for employee well-being. The work-life balance is heavily skewed towards work, with minimal consideration for the personal lives and mental health of the workforce. It's disheartening to see a company overlook the fundamental need for a supportive and healthy work environment.

In summary, my experience at Concentrix has been far from satisfactory. I caution those contemplating employment with this company to weigh the potential drawbacks carefully. There are undoubtedly better opportunities available that prioritize employee satisfaction, professional growth, and a positive work culture.","Where do I even begin...

With its value of being a great place to start a career in the BPO industry, Concentrix allows growth and development in the personal and professional levels. It encourages and recognizes potential in each and every person within the company. The process of developing the holistic aspect of everyone makes Concentrix even more globally competitive. Essentially, life and work balance is highly valued and being manifested in the activities, programs, and policies that are being adapted by the Concentrix.","As genuine as it can be, every company has its gaps and holes, and Concentrix, even with its great value and character in the competitive market, has still some minor downsides. With its quality performance, however, at some point, some technological equipment does not match the need for productivity of some agents, since there are just some minor struggles that are being encountered when using some equipment."

wfh is great
my team was the best","KPI to get monthly bonus in the hands of customers makes 0 sense. If they are unhappy about the resolution (that you give according to policy) they will give you 1 out of 5 and your VOC will drop drastically. 
You are told to start at 8 and go online, but when it's time to log off you have to do it 2 minutes after your log off time because ""we have to wait for the queue to be clear"". Imagine an incoming call that comes in those 2 minutes and you're on the phone for half an hour. That means if you had something else to do, like living the rest of your life, you're late, you can't. 
You can't take your 10 minutes personal time in the last hour of your shift for some unspecified reason, the breaks are tightly scheduled which for a job based on incoming calls is unthinkable. If your break is at 10 am, and you receive a call at 9.58 you have to wait for the call to end before taking your 15 minutes anyway. So what's the point of scheduling them?
Sometimes between 2 breaks there are 3.5/4 hours on an 8-hour shift. 
To progress in your career you have to stay in the same role for at least one year. Other factor for promotion is if you constantly get the bonus by reaching KPI. So if you're good on calls, you will be promoted off the calls."

Benefits (compared to my previous companies): We don't have life insurance. HMO only covers myself and had to pay for the beneficiaries. HMO is currently clinic based so it hard and inconvenient to use whenever you have a medical emergency,

Incentives: There's no monthly incentives for the top performers. We only receive certificates quarterly.

Allowances: As I am working at home, they didn't give me transportation allowance. But I also don't have electricity allowance, internet is provided but will be removed soon (then we'll have to pay for our own internet). Since they did not provide the allowance for transportation, they should provide the electricity and internet allowance as long as we work at home, Also, if we were to work onsite, there will still be no transportation allowance.

Salary: Salary increase should equate with the inflation. Too little yearly increase and couldn't keep up with the inflation."

Strong Leadership","I've had the opportunity to work for Concentrix for 2 years, and overall, it has been a positive experience. The company fosters a collaborative and inclusive work environment, providing numerous opportunities for professional growth and skill development.

However, one area that I believe could use improvement is the process of pay increases. While I appreciate the transparency in communication from the management team, I have observed that the process of salary adjustments tends to be slower than industry averages. This delay has sometimes created challenges for employees looking to align their compensation with their evolving skill sets and contributions to the company.

I believe that a more agile approach to compensation reviews could further enhance employee satisfaction and motivation. I recommend that the company considers streamlining the pay adjustment process to ensure that it aligns more closely with the fast-paced and competitive nature of the industry.

Despite this concern, I remain optimistic about the company's commitment to employee welfare and look forward to witnessing continuous improvements in this area.""

This approach acknowledges the positive aspects of the company while constructively addressing the specific issue of slow pay increase processes. It provides feedback that can be valuable for both current and potential employees and emphasizes a desire for positive change rather than solely focusing on the negative aspects."

Not too productive for the night shift guys having to stay late every time so what would be a 6PM-6AM shift would actually be an additional 60-90min regularly.

Equinix offers ESPP and RSU's are typical. All the sales reps I have came in contact are great. Equinix does a great job at hiring the best sales people. In almost 9 years I never had one issue with any other coworker and quite a few have become lifetime long friends. Yearly sales kick off to Vegas is an awesome experience that Equinix puts in a lot of effort and money into. P-Club is also another amazing experience that Equinix puts a lot of thought an money into. Equinix is the best of the best when it comes to anything Data Center related and that why they can demand such premiums. Decent offices.,"Cons are- low compensation and based salary compared to most other similar roles at other big tech companies. Always changing the comp plan for the worst. Every year the comp plan is cut down and try to make it as complicated as possible. You will work harder and bring in more revenue but get paid less every year. There's a lot of guessing into how you will be paid and half the time the comps aren't paid correctly or have to wait months. Equinix in the last 2 years has really focus on commission pay outs and making sure they can claw back as much as possible. As a global company they have made cross selling with other regions difficult so they do not have to pay full comp if their are multiply reps involved which in a lot times multiply reps are needed! Also, for the last 2 years, Equinix seems to have really focus this effort and money on DEI. I am all for diversity but it's a point where it's in your face 24/7 now. Volunteering is being pushed harder every Q as it seems now it is more mandatory within the company. If you are comfortable in your AE position it looks down upon as you should aspire to be a manager or director one day. There a lot of great team managers and there are few who should not be managing a team. Equinix is huge on promoting within which is a huge pro but a lot times they will promote AE's to management level with no experience or training and seems to be based on how much they like you and not so much your performance. My former manager constantly canceled calls, was late and half the time was somewhere else (why her team was the worst performing). Equinix does not care about loyalty at all! No severance package for tenure reps that have been with Equinix for many years. It's a shame as Equinix was once a great place to work but the Cons now outweigh the Pros and they are chasing away great people.

Adobe,4,45296,LLD + HLD ,MTS-2 Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Noida,"novative Work: Adobe is known for its creative software solutions such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro. Working on such products allows SDEs to be part of innovative and cutting-edge projects.

Adobe,1,45317,Horror show,Lead Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","London, England",Office in London is reasonably nice and they have some good company benefits.,"If I could rate less than 1/5, I would.

HR, or as they call it, ERC department is just plain awful/useless. You're the bad guy if you make a complaint. ""We're going to offer you a generous amount of bereavement leave, but if you decide to use it we're going to treat you like some 💩 we just stepped in.""

Managers are basically allowed to do what they want, and are perfectly allowed to try and derail your career. They can put you in low standing with the company for no justifiable reason, and then even if you want to try and improve yourself, you are no longer allowed the resources to do that.

They also misreport your salary to HMRC so that they think you've been paid vast amounts more than they've paid you (i.e. they duplicate monthly entries), and when you email ERC to tell them, they ignore you and ghost you. Meanwhile, the tax man is taking a 4 figure number out your paycheque each month because they don't know any better.

And when you finally get hard evidence that you've been subject to constructive dismissal and open up a grievance with the company, they will ignore you and ghost you seemingly in the hope that you will go past the 3 month mark of you leaving, meaning you would be unable to go through an employment tribunal process."

It's a big company and you're just another number and they will make you fill a form answering that they are the best or else you will be in HR black list.

X,5,45188,"Innovative and Collaborative, but Fast-Paced: My Journey at Twitter",Software Engineer,Former Employee,,Working at Twitter was an opportunity to be part of an organization that values innovation and encourages employees to think outside the box. The constant push to improve products and services was inspiring. Twitter takes diversity and inclusion seriously. The company's commitment to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment is evident in its policies and initiatives. I had the privilege of working with incredibly talented and passionate colleagues who were dedicated to their roles and always eager to collaborate on projects. Twitter's reach and impact on the world are undeniable. It's gratifying to work for a platform that connects people and enables conversations on a global scale. The fast-paced nature of the tech industry means there is always something new to learn. Twitter provided ample opportunities for professional growth and development.,"While the fast-paced environment can be invigorating, it can also be overwhelming at times. Keeping up with the rapid changes and demands of the industry can be challenging. Maintaining a healthy work-life balance can be a struggle, especially during crunch times and product launches. It's essential to set clear boundaries and prioritize self-care. Twitter sets high expectations for its employees, which can be both motivating and demanding. Meeting these expectations requires dedication and commitment. The tech industry is highly competitive, and staying ahead of the curve requires constant effort. This can sometimes lead to stress and a sense of urgency. The transition to remote work brought about by external factors had its share of challenges, including communication hurdles and feelings of isolation. However, Twitter made efforts to mitigate these issues."

Even if the commute is 3 hours, they won't give you flexibility. Any WFH goes straight to Elon for approval. They check your badge log. - No free food despite having to go into the office. There are meals you can buy for $5, but they might get rid of that soon. They give you granola bars, but you even have to pay for snacks. - Random Elon requests: You have to submit monthly reviews of what you do (big-brother style) and you'll never know if it's a layoff. He'll pander you for ideas to improve the company. - Chaos: Company is bleeding talent. Teams are stretched so thin so expect to take on 3-5x the workload of an average employee. Is there a process/policy that your team follows? Throw that out the door cause Elon doesn't follow them. You'll find out about any OKRs through his Twitter feed. - Shut up and do your work: Don't question or push back, just do as you're told or you can get fired. - Promotions are rare, they don't care about career development. The goal is for you to work so hard you burn out and leave, then they just hire new people. - The attitude is that you're privileged to work for Elon, so any compensation is stocks (worthless for the foreseeable future). - Want to travel to HQ? You can stay in a meeting room on one of the floors in the building. - BRG, ERG, WLB? Consider that not applicable when you sign the offer letter."

Personally I left a huge amount of $$$ on the table because I simply couldn’t bear to spend another minute with this bunch and I absolutely pity the remaining folks who unfortunately are mostly there to keep their visas or because they have financial obligation.

- Friendly colleagues 
- Great culture for the most part 
- Very relaxed; great work-life balance 
- Nice offices with the usual free food and snacks
- Good managers for the most part, but I got lucky","- The culture is maybe too relaxed. There are some very good people at Twitter, but also a lot who are just sitting around collecting paychecks. Was impossible to fire anyone even when they're severely underperforming.
- Not very performance oriented, though they're trying to change this. Promotions were mostly based on tenure. 
- Disorganized, with silos and no clear direction or urgency, and quite risk averse. As a result of this and the other cons I listed above, Twitter struggles to ship. 
- Kind of high-schoolish. Thankfully I never experienced any beer pong type stuff, but the company seems to celebrate a certain personality type (bombastic and extroverted) regardless of how good their work is. After seeing the same people on stage at company events over and over again, I concluded I was unlikely ever able to rise up to a leadership position here. 
- Leadership (staff and director level and up) needs to be more diverse.

Initially people may be attracted by the research (or R&D) but soon realize that this is not a very productive research environment.
- If you group is controlled by manager who is completely incompetent, it will stifle all progress or research. Can't generalize this to all groups, but I have seen similar things happen more often than not.
- Senior management (essentially Roger) although nice, is practically useless. 
- Not much collaboration is going on.
- The culture is quite backwardish, for example, working on weekends is praised, it is apparently acceptable to scold or shame employees, long and useless meetings are held in which the manager (or occasionally Roger) talk endlessly.
- Not much (not any!) growth opportunities.
- Pay is not competitive for full-time employees."

(This review is based on my personal experience in a particular group. I don't think every group is the same. So ask, observe, and do your research about a group.)

First of all, this place is called a ""research"" lab, but it's barely one. Some people, when they decide to forget about financial gains (will come back to this later) and join a research lab, want to publish papers and build up an academic profile. If you are one of those people, think twice about joining this place, especially some groups. Look at if any of the recent departures from the group went to a place you'd like to be. If the odds is against you, there is probably a good reason there. You may be different, but you will still be constrained by the lab. You will probably get much less ""research"" and much more ""development"" than you thought. ""Freedom of research"" is more often just used to entice you to join; after you join, you will likely be assigned something your manager tell you ""very critical"" for the company and you have to do it. For those who really wants to do academic research, it's much better to find a postdoc position with a great mentor. I know, you will sacrifice a little financially, but the long term gain will be worthwhile. Plus, you are not going up too much anyway.

Secondly, your direct manager's power is pervasive and democracy is non-existent. Of course the org is flat and on top of your manager there is Roger (president, who is kind and approachable, by the way). What this means is that, managers have no chance to move up in the company, because they can't replace Roger. When you get no chance to go up in a company, what would you do? You think about next opportunity, and you don't think about taking a long-term view in managing and helping your reports. Some manager chose to use everything they could to get things for themselves in preparation for a future job jump, and some times this is at the expense of what could help researchers. When your manager takes a very short-term view to maximize his gain, that's bad news for you. What makes it worse is, your manager decides everything, literally everything, from what you should work on on a weekly basis, what intern you may get in the summer (if you get one), what's your performance review and bonus, and who you should put on your paper (Of course, manager gets to be on almost every paper, regardless of how little he does for that paper.) This kind of massive power on a manager can easily produce dictators. In the meetings, generally people are obedient towards the manager, rather than actively voicing their opinions. It's sad.

Now let's come to compensation. Japanese companies generally don't believe in giving out equity (stocks) to employees. It's a fact that, in the bay area, you can't live on wages alone. Houses can easily go 1.x million if you want to be in a reasonable area (with good elementary schools and close to where you work). This is a very realistic problem if you want to have a life here. Don't forget that you will not get what you are offered - it's taxed much higher than when you were at school so you will get about close to half of that amount. Think about how long you will be able to get your down payment for a house and pay back the debt. Compare that with upstart American companies. It's very easy to find such information from friends or online. Realistically think about your livelihood and think if it's going to be worthwhile to make half of what you could make for a few papers that you may or may not get to publish.

Some people chose to join this place to get a green card because NEC applies for it for you right after you start. This is totally unnecessary. With your papers and PhD degree, you will get an EB1 green card almost anywhere you go in a few months. The cost totally outweigh the gain.

And finally, you want to be working in a place that you are proud of. Consider if this is going to be that place. If you are the kind of people who want to get a ""wow!"" when you tell people where you work, you'll be disappointed if you join this place."

The level of trust extended to employees is unprecedented, distinguishing this as a truly employee-centric organization. The global marketing team consistently treated you with utmost respect and valued your contributions highly. Abundant learning opportunities abound, and the company's commitment to work-life balance enhances the overall quality of life.","For a company that prided itself on inclusion, I felt like an outsider. Not in terms of race or sexual orientation and all those things but working in operations and especially marketing, you are treated like a second-grade citizen by the PS folks. Inside the marketing cocoon, you notice nothing, but once you step out of it the problems become more apparent. Lately with the rapid expansion following the public listing and the consequent layoffs, the company seems to have lost its way. A bunch of mediocre hires, especially at slightly senior levels is making the company lose its family-like feel.

Culture is the best and the key different of Thoughtworks. It shapes people to have empathy, no blaming each others, encourage each others, and be nice to everyone. I've never seen any coworkers as nice as people here.","It's a consultant company. You're not gonna get any exciting project much. It's hard to have any chance to dive deep on technical field you 're interested. The company encourages people to learn new tools as many as they can since engineer will be assigned to new project every 1-2 years.

Sadly this has shifted more towards ""just make the client happy"" regardless of the employee's well being.","For a company with such a bug motto of taking care of their employees well beings and the importance of diversity, they're quite quick at disregarding all that and making every single one of their employees unhappy in order to make the clients happy, even when the client's demands are absurd and go againts what thoughtworks claims to be their priorities and values. It's said that actions speak louder than words, and thoughtworks's actions do not align with their so called values. Not to mention promotions have been frozen for ages, so the possibiloty of advancing in the carreer is inexistence, no matter how many times you exceed in the performance evaluation."

-being a consultancy (more outsourcing for the Romanian branch), they depend on projects. They hire you without knowing for sure if they actually have a suitable project for you or if their client accepts you on the project. This creates a large pool of people on the ""bench"", where you have to wait (in some cases months) and maybe contribute to some internal initiatives. If there are no projects or if clients do not accept you on the projects...guess what happens? ...exactly: you are laid off...and if you are ""lucky"" they lay you off with 1 week before probation period ends, to give you ""a lot"" of time to search for a new opportunity. Saddest part is, the management is aware that this might happen when they hire you! They basically exploit the law in their favor. This happened not only to me but to other colleagues, some of which came from very solid companies, some changed careers, trusting the Thoughtworks brand behind this company.

Overall, probably the worst experience you can have in your career."

Also, you might get a lot of visibility if you like to give talks and promote passionately any tech topic, as the company is hungry to have any new ways to differentiate from the competitors.","After going public, Thoughtworks it's just another consultancy company, really far away from the premium partner once it was. The limits of not working with customers related to gambling or countries that doesn't respect human rights are fading really fast, and day by day, the employees are becoming more like numbers to rent no matter what, so the company earnings increases as much as possible. Maybe a more relaxed company than other consultancies, but also paying way below the market. The founder's idea of the company it's now just a facade while most of the talent is moving on because of the low salaries, weird behaviours agains what we are supposed to represent, layoffs and organisational changes."

Also, some Social Change initiatives the company is doing are actually great.","This used to be a great place to work, with amazing culture and values, a respect for employees and minorities, and an extra care for good practices. Since we went publicly available, everything went off.

Values and culture are not respected anymore, we don't provide any value to our clients, we just lend workforce like any other consultancy firm in the world. On top of that, the management does practically nothing; almost all of the bureaucracy, client management, etc. has to be done by the folks that are also doing the actual work.

Not only that, but we sell workers to the clients in a category that we are not really in (like eg. selling a consultant as a senior), adding even more burden to our pour souls.

I can understand that in some cases you have to perform over your current grade to show that you can be switched to the next one, but they also have changed the performance review system to make it more about micromanagement than anything else.

If all of these wasn't enough, salaries have been frozen for +2 years with no perspective to be updated. Same with salary bands.

When it comes to work and life balance, they are clearly pushing to remove remote work, but this is a problem because lots of us don't live even close to the offices. So how the company is solving this ""issue""? They are making work conditions worst to force employees to leave and hire new ones with new contracts.

They also moved from country based decision making to whole Europe based decision making. The reasoning was (amongst others) to share brilliant minds accross the continent. The reality is they are letting people go from most expensive european countries and hiring them in the affordable ones.

We also used to be an environmental friendly company, but not anymore. We changed from a sustainable business to an indefinite growing model, and we now support technologies like GenAI, which are a fraud and VERY bad for the environment, without anyone even questioning any of it.

Thoughtworks is now not even a shade of what it was."

Those values were gone ages ago and the hiring bar has not been the same anymore for several years. They are just a glorified consultancy just as many other large consultancy companies out there. The Australian region is the worst-performing region across the globe. The leaders in the Australian region are awful and have no real engineering background (some of them were software testers) and have grown as in most consultancy companies with sheer internal connections. Most people with sales and good communication skills have gone up the ranks and they've pulled up people similar to them to form a mutual benefit society. Even during redundancies, this company was so unethical that they made the least connected (not performing) people within the organization redundant first.

Way too much time is spent on the weekly all-company meeting ""Asakai"" on these topics. It is sometimes useful and often is a total waste of time. Please I just need to know how the company is doing financially, and get back to do my work. Information is very siloized. One big reason is because everyone still spends most of their time WFH, at least on the engineering side. Oh, sure, we are all supposed to come to work 3 days a week, but this is not enforced at all. A natural consequence is the rank-and-file seldom talks to their peers and only the managers know what's going on. This is great of you are one of those people who just likes to take orders and march, but it makes a very frustrating experience if you want to have a say on what you are doing and decide whether you are doing the right thing for the company. If you have been in the company for a long time, you will be fine, because you know who to talk to and where to find stuff, but if you are new, you'd better be extra-motivated."

Rakuten,5,43778,Fantastic so far!,Android Engineer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Beloit, WI","I just started a few weeks ago, but so far I'm loving the place. I'm at the Beloit office. I live a good distance away, so they let me work from home twice a week, which is very nice. 

But I actually don't mind driving the ~60 miles to the office most days, since it's pretty great to be there. Everyone there is super nice. And they have food - so much food!

When I'm in the office, I eat breakfast and lunch there, on the house. They cater lunches and post the next week's menu at the end of each week. And they basically have a fully-stocked kitchen. Tons and tons of snacks (dispensers with M&Ms and cashews all over the office). A full soda fountain with Coke and Pepsi products. And even a kegerator with a rotating batch of beer and hard cider. All just there for you to have whenever you want. All they ask is that you don't bring any of it home with you, which is totally reasonable.

As far as the work goes, most of my team is actually in California, so there's lots of video calls. I'm working on a large and complex piece of software now, but I came from a tiny dev shop before this, so the transition hasn't been without challenges for me. But the team has been super accommodating of that, and I really appreciate it.","Beloit isn't the best location to have an office; the Madison area would be far better. But much of their workforce at that office lives in Illinois, so it's totally understandable.

Can't think of much more than that for now, but I'm pretty new still. Will definitely update if things change in the future."

Weird culture. The company is a mix of OC culture (pretty fair on work/life balance) and Japanese culture (late hours, put in your face-time, don't leave til your boss leaves, etc). It partially depends on which group you're in.
Business is tough. Buy.com doesn't have much a differentiation from Amazon (1st party business) and eBay (marketplace business), and they definitely don't do either as well as the other guys. It's a difficult market to compete in.
Lots of turnover. Plenty of people moving on to greener pastures. If you stick around long enough, and have some talent/skill, you got a good chance of progressing. There's some politicking involved, but probably not more than the average company of similar size."

Until mid 2014, issues regarding the rebranding still existed. Both consumers and businesses are not open to the change or the name. How does this translate to the work environment? More stress for everyone. Numbers that go up and down. Small teams that desperately need more people are unable to handle the influx of merchant demand. Sales has a harder time pitching. A number of top management left (albeit not due to issues but for their own personal reasons). This left more aggressive, and now-focused (as opposed to future focused) management in place.

Bringing up issues with your supervisor tend to be overlooked a lot. Nothing ever seems to get resolved as far as a better incentive program or making the employees feel more valued/respected. 

The system they have as far as quota is jacked because some supervisors put agents on projects which can make their numbers higher or they have another agent helping with training (making your numbers lower) yet you're expected to still make the same exact quota as an agent who had been working without interruptions their entire shift.

Red Hat,2,45314,2024 thoughts,Senior Presales Manager,Current Employee,"Washington, DC",Great technology stack based on open source roots.,IBM's influence is strong. Make sure that you have a good leadership team before joining.
Red Hat,3,45274,Sales,Senior Sales Executive,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,They care about their culture and employee feedback. Good communication from leadership to all employees. Middle Sales mgmt seems supportive but hands are tied and cannot innovate. Host some nice area product events for customers.,Overly heavy on DEI comes across as phony or forced. Hire the best people you can. HR is a strong arm of the palace to a fault. Company should be more sales internally driven. RH has gotten fairly cheap on itself and towards employees. Ok benefits but not a leader in what it offers for pricing value. Too much IBM creep into RH.
Red Hat,2,45138,Not What it Used to Be,Customer Success Manager (CSM),"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,Some really smart people doing really good work for customers. Front line employees always willing to share knowledge and go the extra mile for customers and others within the organization.,It took several years but the acquisition by IBM has ruined what Red Hat once was. Unrealistic targets based on incessant need for growth rather than based on real world numbers or data. Red Hat never even broached the subject of a resource action prior to the IBM acquisition and now those left need to get used to the IBM approach of at least two RA's per year. This place is a pressure cooker ready to explode due to quarter to quarter unrealistic targets. Senior management is feeling the enormous pressure and have been flailing about for the last year. Their only response has been to push the pressure down to the people doing the real work and if that doesn't work start letting people go. There now are much better places to work where your contributions will be more valued.

Red Hat,2,45064,Goodbye Open Culture,People Team,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,"The Red Hat that once was, before current leadership was in place, was full of opportunity and growth. Open was real.","The current leadership in place at Red Hat is out to change the place altogether. Take the recent layoffs as an example, the People Team did their layoffs in a 4 minute call. THE PEOPLE TEAM. The team that is supposed to care about how this place is run. How people are treated. They showed their true colors. They “eliminated roles” and it wasn’t “performance based” but then it’s uncovered that they just moved the remaining people into those roles to put a bandaid on the gaps. Is that how it works? Seems a little…suspicious. And it cannot go without being addressed that the current leader of the People Team is essentially hiring all of her friends from Cisco. She’s been at Red Hat 2 years and slowly chipping away at this great company. Conforming to other companies cultures and ways of doing business and erasing how Red Hat has operated for so many years. Don’t get me wrong, change is necessary and how a company grows. But at what point do we question the leadership for devastating change?"

I have personally experienced and observed situations involving others in which new roles are forced upon high performing associates as ""career growth opportunities,"" even when associates make it clear that they are not interested in those particular roles. In my particular experience, I was given a choice to accept a management role or be transitioned out of the company.

Red Hat,4,45090,"Great Colleagues, Good Work, Mixed Vision",Developer Advocate,Current Employee,,"Most reviews mention the same pros, but I guess I’ll repeat them. The WLB and work culture is pretty great. You get to work with interesting technology and many great people. Honestly, the pay and benefits are pretty good. RSU allocation could be higher. Given the WLB it’s not bad in my opinion, it’s just not as high as some peers. People putting in the extra effort generally get more RSUs to my knowledge, and do get raises.","Some teams and people complain of poor compensation, lack of raises, and RSUs. Lots of people at Red Hat were able to coast and got stuck in old ways. There was a huge bias towards enterprise Java and on-premise until recently. Sure, it’s a large part of the market and core business but it left Red Hat looking like Old Hat. There’s a lot of process at times. All big companies probably get this way, but it’s frustrating when simple or important tasks can take weeks to finish. Leadership has felt directionless for a while, though they are improving. Recent layoffs were handled poorly; some high value people/initiatives were mistakenly affected and morale took a hit."

Red Hat,3,45187,"Mileage will vary, but beware",Product Sales Specialist,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,#NAME?,"This is a sale oriented review, so it likely isn't relevant to other areas. I personally would not recommend working at Red Hat. The culture has severely degraded and while OpenShift and Ansible are very good solutions, they do not justify the premium IBM is driving from Red Hat in order to recoup their $34B investment. Red Hat is on a negative trajectory, and although IBM is buying time to turn it around, it's not a pleasant place to be right now. OTEs have become largely unobtainable except for the very few top accounts. Everyone else is looking at a multi-year cadence of hitting less than 50% of quota, with some only achieving single digits. For a 50/50 plan, that just isn't acceptable and nearly everyone I've talked to is actively looking for a new gig. Management is in self-preservation mode distancing themselves as much as they can from the underperforming regions/accounts. This means a PIP culture has started and those with the short straw are being left with no real alternative than to leave...regardless of their overall abilities. Be aware that the comp plan is rumored to be changing significantly in 2024, and no one seems very clear as to how it will impact sales people. Ask some good questions if you are interviewing. I also have found that Red Hat on my resume is to not a positive attribute. The Red Hat reputation as a 'legacy brand' along with the IBM association isn't very interesting to most hiring managers..at least, not in sales."

ST Electronics (Singapore),5,44668,Software house that sells insurance products,Full Time Lead Sales Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,"- Insurance policy and retirement scheme well known in civil servant market. Ask any civilian out there, quite sure no one can list any COTS items that ST does except for their retirement plan. This product is also consistent throughout entire of ST Engineering. The retirement plans sometimes offer more than 100% extra of the last drawn salary of some civil servants. 
- We offer additional jobs to some civil service appointment holders so that they do not get affected by inflation. These are important people to lead our country. Take a look at our board of directors and you can see that it contains our defence parliament secretary, MPs, CDF. 
- Company is quite united from top to bottom. During recession, our CEO took a big pay cut to tide the company pass recession. After recession, everyone from top to bottom took only a 1% increment in exchange for a 30% (for 5.7% growth) increment for our CEO. No complaints heard from anyone below. This is how much we care for our higher management. 
- We pay market rate for our CEO and Presidents, VP. As for engineers not being paid a market rate, they need to understand that this is a insurance company. If you are not involved in sales, you can be expected to be paid admin rate. 
- SMRT, ComfortDelgro are coming near to our competitive insurance package, but we are still ahead of them in the race pack.","- Not really a con. Company says that going for courses is considered 'urgent' request. This means that you are recommended to stay irrelevant and staying status quo is the best course of action to tide through covid period. Training courses doesnt add any value to your current job, and it only increases chances of job hopping and covid infection risks. The only course your company will recommend you is the defence masters course. This course will allow them to keep the image of being relevant in the defence industry, while also ensuring that engineers and managers will be flooded with irrelevant skillsets to prevent job hopping. 
- Most retired civil servants are forced to lead double lives as IT project managers. Alot of them struggle to understand software terminologies and software development cycles. Most of them struggle with their double lives and sometimes the lack of armor vehicles and aircrafts in a software house does make them look out of place. Sometimes, additional project engineers need to be hired to do the job of these IT project managers, which is a grave insult to the capabilities of these managers. It is equivalent to telling them that they can lead a battalion in war, but needs a clerk to front the war for them. ST needs to gives ample opportunities for them to learn on the job."

Very supportive overall from a social aspect.,Fair few unfortunately. Progression appears limited and a lot of hoops to jump through for seemingly limited gain. Strange large crossover in comp for people at varying levels of seniority. Huge cluster of people at 'Senior consultant' level who seem overqualified given years of experience. Line management always in favour of client whether or not client requests are reasonable or not. Perhaps down to the nature of the business being driven by money available through large managed service contracts and independent day rate engagements. Teams sometimes carried by one or two more senior devs who are expected to cover for large numbers of juniors advertised to client as stronger than they are which seems unfair. Presumably comes down to budgets and keeping overheads lower for the business if the client bid has not provided enough capital.

2. Pay is not great & definitely not in line with industry standards. There can also be wild differences in pay levels for people within the same role.
3. Flagging point 1 to management, the offer of support is very minimal, especially considering that many of my predecessors had flagged to them the same issue.
4. Some of the tasks in my job I expected, some I did not. It should have rung alarm bells when (before the interview stage) I was told there was no JD for the role.
5. Bonuses are awful. A £40 voucher? Which we were asked (voluntarily) to contribute towards our Xmas party? Also the Xmas party & Xmas Dinner you have to pay for to participate in... WHAT? I've never ever had that at any company I've worked at. There's normally a budget for the company to throw an Xmas celebration for its staff!
6. We supposedly pride ourselves on being stringent on our security. However we recently had traveller friends camp out in the carpark for a couple of weeks. How is that stringent security?"

Yahoo,1,45261,Overwork Loyal Employees,Account Manager,Former Employee,,Co-workers and peers are friendly.,"Within the Account Management Department: 

Employees that have been there 2-3 years or more are given extreme work loads, handling accounts across 2 or 3 different teams. Since the company sells 50+ products, the learning curve is more than a year so tenured account managers are the only ones that understand the ins and outs of the products and are given all of the work. 

The extreme work load coupled with technology that often breaks (launching products across 4 or more different systems) means that advertising clients are often upset and escalating to sales. Account Managers are then yelled at by clients and then again internally by the middle sales managers. It's very stressful.

Recommended as a workplace if you plan to stay 1-2 years, any longer than that will break your soul."

Example 1: Culture Clash and Stagnation
Headline: All that glitters is not gold: A disillusioned year at Zendesk

Pros: Great office perks, decent starting salary, some talented colleagues.

Cons:

Culture gone stale: The ""fun"" startup vibe quickly fades into micromanagement and metrics obsession. Creativity and initiative are discouraged, replaced by rigid processes and KPIs.
Career opportunities? Mirage: Promotions are rare, and growth feels limited. Management talks a big game about career development, but it rarely translates into reality.

Leadership disconnect: Upper management seems out of touch with the daily grind, focusing more on optics and growth figures than employee well-being.

Zendesk,2,45164,Can only recommend if you're starting your career in tech,Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","San Francisco, CA",Good work life balance for some teams (others work 10+hours a day) Good healthcare plan,"Leadership is weak and incompetent across the board (this isn't an exaggeration) as most are only in their position either because of contacts, politics or simply sticking around for 5+ years as others with actual talent move on to better opportunities. Company lacks clear direction and leadership likes to talk in circles without saying anything at all while dismissing genuine concerns voiced by numerous employees over the last year. Some departments have downright toxic leadership (see current sexual harassment lawsuit); the company may also be engaged in some other questionable activities (can't confirm but there are rumblings). Pay for some employees is well below industry standard and with RSUs gone there's no meaningful way to make up for the lower TC. Top talent has been leaving in droves at all levels and with the company now operating in post PE mode (i.e. cost-cutting) replacing them is unlikely as talented people aren't generally willing to work for low pay. The culture that made the company popular for many years is all but dead and gone now and only getting worse with each passing month."

If you are on the presales side of the house, be prepared to do 90-100% of the work in the sales cycle while most of your AE and CSM counterparts coast and have 0 accountability to learn the product. Executive team is completely disconnected from the rest of the org in their ivory towers asking more and more from employees as if 40 hrs a work week is non existent. They aren't backfilling roles.

The board went right along with these polarizing collections of buzzwords that ultimately cost us everything. This culminated in a battle to sell the company that was heavily politicized internally. Ultimately he declined a fair offer, our shares lost half their value in a few months. That left us with a fire sale offer from bloodless Private Equity stakeholders. We were lucky to get half the peak value of our remaining shares. The first and continuing order of business has been to reduce the payrolls. This started with layoffs in November 2022. Like a few hundred others, this was my last day. The weekend before, they leaked the plans with an early filing in accordance with the WARN act. Presumably this was an effort to demoralize more into quitting. Hundreds of long-time employees in good standing were fired in order to signal to PE that we're a real, super-serious company now. Obviously this wasn't enough, and remaining management is being coached to reduce the payrolls in medium-to-high cost of living areas."

There's opportunity if you want it.","The core values of the company have changed since the acquisition took place in January 2023. Countless C and E level employees have left in the last year as a result of going private. Mass exodus. The management that remains is inexperienced, the product doesn't seem to have as good a reputation as it did, and several benefits that made working here fantastic have been pulled and nothing has been done to make up for things like no inflationary increase in salary this year, no bonus opportunities to earn more in friendly sales competitions, no longer receiving stocks or equity in the company since its now private and the core progressive values instilled by Mikkel and so many amazing people have evaporated. I could list a dozen other negative changes, but I digress. This is no longer a progressive ""employees first"" company. Its a corporation who will hold the lowest employees responsible for the organizations failures. PS There are no opportunities to advance in sales like there used to be. Massive layoffs mean no open positions. They're downsizing to save on costs. Many of us have been waiting well over a year to move up (the one's who have earned it) and there are no opportunities internally. There's also no sympathy about this from management. We were literally told to ""get off the boat if you don't want to be a part of this rocky journey,"" after the acquisition went through."

Very. Many. Deals over 1K are considered ""strategic"" on an enterprise team. The company uses a competitor CRM internally as their own offering isn't competitive. Management reaching out for long conversations and requests to do work on days off. It's a bureaucratic nightmare to get anything done. The pricing model is ridiculous and unsustainable. Even the CEO skipped town. While there are decent people here, far too many people speak out of both sides of their mouth, and that includes senior leadership. The go-to-market strategy hasn't evolved to meet where the market is today. Alot of inflated egos. Alot of highly anxious, fear-based behaviors. Too much insincere, passive-aggressive (and sometimes just aggressive) behaviors. Claims to be diverse and welcoming, but also lost a class action suit due to unfair treatment of protected classes. Every company has problem areas where they could do better, but Zendesk stacks alot of issues with very positives to offset the nonsense."

Zendesk,2,45083,Treasure turned to trash,Account Executive,Current Employee,,- Flexible work environment -- 100% remote for those 50+ miles away from any office location. - They leave you alone if you perform well. - PTO for sales is 21 days + you get 11 or 12 paid holidays. - Product has great brand recognition.,"- Sold to private equity firms in November 2022 and they've turned what was once a treasure of a company into trash and a stress pit. - They sneakily cut GTM's commission structures so you have to hit around 150% of your quota or more on average to hit OTE. They bamboozled everyone into thinking the new commission structure was going to make them MORE money but if you read the actual ICP, it's the complete opposite. Sales leadership didn't even understand the new ICP and how it affected them even until it was brought to their attention by concerned AEs. Nothings changed though but supposedly now that leadership knows they're affected by it too they're pushing for change. TBD but not hopeful. - The culture is going way downhill. It used to be AMAZING but now everyone is extremely stressed all the time and overworked. - There's no work-life balance anymore. - The PE firm have also made what was promised last year from the old ownership to be a 100% flexible WFH if you want environment to forcing anyone who lives within a 50 mile radius of an office to go back to the office at least twice a week. 50 miles is A LOT and to be forced to do so after years of WFH and being able to enjoy life more is horrible in my mind. -- It's easy for executive leadership to force return to offices when they have the money to pay for their childcare. What about the people who can't? I'm glad I live far more than 50 miles way from an office because everyone I know who has been forced back at Zendesk is not happy about it. Office work isn't the way for millennials and gen Z and wasting life commuting and having your mental health affected being forced to go back to a physical office isn't the new way of life anymore. - All departments are so disconnected from one another and the processes they have in place conflict with another department's -- so there's no true REAL process. It's extremely cumbersome and has only gotten worse with the new PE firm takeover. - Unvested RSUs were cut by 50+% for pay out with the new ownership came in. Went from 30k to just 12k. - The PE firm took away a CRUCIAL benefit for employees when they took over -- Recharge Fridays where we got half days every Friday. Now it's one Friday per QUARTER. - PE firm took away personal development funds as well. - I know there are other cons I just can't think of right now."

Managers pressure ICs to find a way to promotion without any real path actually existing. - Most middle managers are promoted from IC roles and don’t know what good management looks like, and are given no training. - Least amount of task visibility or project organization of any company I’ve worked for; Leads to lack of shared sense of accomplishment and siloing of work. - Company recently switched to a top-down decision-making strategy (I.e., waterfall), so engineers are even more siloed and have fewer opportunities for visibility & collaboration. Design often doesn’t factor in cost to build."

I had to solve problems between the Hosts and the Guests. And often times both people felt like they were in the right. (someone is almost always wrong) I was constantly in the middle of two adults arguing. The phrase: ""The customer is always right"" doesn't really work when the Host and the Guest are both your customers. So often times solutions would leave one party unhappy which was very stressful for me. I didn't like feeling that way. Ultimately I left because I just wanted a Job that was less negative and stressful. But I do want to mention that this was just the nature of the job, it is not Airbnb's fault.

Our stories are very boring, the creative directors have a 1990s print style. Our videos are like channel 5 in the 90s. It's very cringe and everyone thinks they're gods gift to the world. You get worn down day by day. Young and talented people leave. Only those who cannot go anywhere else (oldies) and those who smoke their way to their senior roles remain.

The management is composed by young and open-minded people. The office in Italy is composed by people coming from all over the world and there are a lot of vertical growth opportunities given that the office has been recently opened and the company is hiring a lot.
Another very good point is the flexibility of the work. For the majority of the roles it is possible to work from home 80% of the time and there are also some roles that allow the full-remote contract (without impacting the salary).
In general as an employee you feel trusted and your ideas are always taken into account by your managers.

Usually you get the feedback like it's a crisis in the company and in the world, so you should wait and perhaps in the future the raise will be accepted. The management doesn't give you any terms and the communication is unclear, in the best case the bonus will be assigned to you(usually 2-5 percent of year salary).
The situation can be completely changed if you have an offer from another company and you are really an experienced developer or a ""star"" in this case the management will find the money to do a counteroffer...
2) Management doesn't care about your personal development, and it doesn't care about giving you a project road map or smth like that. Usually it looks as if you just do some routine job and it's okey for everybody. The less questions you have the better it is."

The company has organized processes.","This company’s culture is money first, … end of sentence. Since joining Amadeus, HR and senior management have whittled away at what benefits, compensation, and a productive, fun working structure our unit had. I have witnessed many employees’ lives be disrupted by poor compensation offers or adjustments based on outdated market data averages that don’t appreciate real-life cost of living circumstances. My closest colleagues face ongoing stress in their personal lives due to poor compensation and minimal benefits that are an insult to high-performers. There are many employees who receive compensation above their tier’s salary band, though others are told that they cannot earn more due to such bands presenting a limit. What hypocrisy! Many benefits that we were told would be maintained, such as professional talk therapy coverage, have been eliminated (this should tell you what they think about employee wellbeing). As an expert recruiter would know, an ambitious employee should be promoted every 12-18 months, though we are not permitted to be considered for promotion before 24 months- effectively meaning that career progression is slothful. Which few people I have seen promoted in the last 24 months from our business group have strictly been white males while folks of other demographics have proven their worthiness for recognition and reward."

Due to finances, they've stopped 401k matching, semi-annual bonuses, and no Annual Compensation Review for the past year. Employees that are still there are unhappy, like no bonuses, no 401k, no ACR, how do they expect to retain employees? The talented employees have begun to leave one by one already. 

There's no long-term growth here. You have to play politics well and kiss up to upper management to get promoted. Otherwise, you're going to be stuck being a B-grade employee that will never see a promotion for years, despite doing your work well."

As a remote worker, you have the opportunity to work alongside and learn from professionals from diverse backgrounds, which can broaden your perspective and enrich your skill set. Flexible Work Schedule: Remote work often allows for more flexibility in terms of when and where you work. This can lead to a better work-life balance, allowing you to tailor your work hours to your personal preferences and needs. Reduced Commute: One of the most obvious benefits of remote work is the elimination of a daily commute. This can save you both time and money, reduce stress, and contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle. Cost Savings: Remote workers typically save money on commuting, work attire, and dining out. You might also benefit from lower living costs if you choose to live in a more affordable location. Increased Productivity: Some people find that they are more productive when working remotely because they can create a workspace that suits their needs and preferences. Fewer distractions from colleagues can also contribute to increased productivity. Improved Work-Life Balance: Remote work can make it easier to balance your professional and personal life. You can schedule breaks to spend time with family or take care of personal errands, leading to a better overall quality of life.",No saving fund at the end

The compensation is fair for the work I do, and the benefits, including health insurance, bonuses, and allowances for personal development and well-being, make it even more rewarding. Furthermore, the work environment is not only conducive but also fosters a healthy atmosphere, which contributes to my enjoyment of the job and helps maintain a satisfying work-life balance. I'm genuinely appreciative of the chance to be a part of this company.","Personal: There isn't an office in my country, which means I'm quite a distance away from my parents and family (though being an expat has its advantages). Another downside is that while the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the job is exciting, it can sometimes be challenging to keep up/adapt to all those updates and changes. Additionally, the absence of Religious Holiday Allowance, which is offered by some companies in other countries, is a minor con."

I had it the first one and a half month until the restructuring.,"Ever since the CEO changed, some of the internal things change as well hence some benefits are removed. E.g the global two days off which was a good initiative back then they remove it in 2023. Additionally with lots of things added to the plate, the salary given wasn't worth it anymore.

If you're in their Supply department (sales), it's kinda hard to move around internally as there's not much opportunities."

I was already happy with where I was at. Agoda compensated my work and contributions well twice a year, after every performance review and I was already very satisfied with it. Little did I know, not only I was compensated by my contributions, the value I add and the skills I acquired throughout the process has prepared me to take on bigger roles. Agoda is serious about employees who proactively takes responsibility of their growth. My managers are also skilled enough to identify opportunities to support my growth. I took responsibility of my growth, and Agoda never failed to recognize it.",Agoda takes care of everything you need. My family was a non-negotiable for me.

- Some job flexibility. I've seen people move internally every 1-2 years to very different roles, but now it's much harder with new processes.","- Benefits have decreased over the past 2 years. No more equity for middle managers and junior level employees (L6 and below). 
- 2 redundancies over the past couple of years (one in 2020 and another in 2023).
- High expectations and workloads with low salaries. Over the past year, workloads have increased due to people leaving combined with redundancies, but roles are rarely backfilled. That workload is shifted to existing employees now. Roles and responsibilities of every level have increased, while salary bands have decreased. 
- Very few promotions this year, and salary increases are very minimal and not worth the increased expectations.
- High turnover. I think average turnover is around 1 year. 
- Return to office 3 days a week, mandatory
- Too much change. Every few months there is an org change, so it's difficult to understand long term direction and growth of the company.

Ever since the pace of development has slowed to a snails pace, innovation is stifled and Deliveroo will end up falling behind. 

Now they are refusing to give promotions to the majority of people in the latest performance review, likely hoping people will quit so they won't have to pay redundancies. All that is going to happen is we will loose the best people and they will end up having to spend more money hiring and training new people to take their place. All a waste in the name of saving money. Add to this the decision to return to the office 3 days a week, while not returning any of the pre covid office benefits like snacks or free lunches, it seems like the employees are undervalued."
Deliveroo,2,45323,Going steadily downhill,Data Scientist,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"Not much micromanaging.

Every few months, the company implements some new policy to worsen working conditions (e.g. no longer awarding stock options to any but the most senior staff, forcing people back into the office, redundancies, implementing new metrics for tracking productivity).

The company does not consider employee feedback when making decisions.

Staffing crises caused by the company trying to outsource new hiring overseas, meaning that when people leave, they are very slow to be replaced."

Deliveroo,1,45303,Toxic workplace,Finance Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","London, England",#NAME?,"CULTURE: 
- Toxic culture displayed at every level, from CEO shouting and swearing at staff infront of a full office, to undermining and aggressive communications during meetings to all levels of employees. 
- Lack of transparency from senior leadership and constant change in direction. 
- Zero work life balance. You’re expected to be available at all hours, not just via Slack but also on calls. Funny looks if you leave the office before 7pm, often have to declare your reason for leaving ‘early’.
- Finance team is not diverse, by this I do not mean demographics however work experience. Predominantly ex consultant, ex big four, resulting in project based way of thinking rather than coordinated and controlled finance process. 
- Competition rather than collaboration. 

WORKLOAD
- Obsession with ‘docs’, I.e, writing 30 page word documents akin to your university dissertation - full prose and storytelling rather than assimilating important information into a few slides. 
- After writing your 30 page document, you then sit in meeting rooms in silence, for up to an hour, while people read it and tag comments instead of discussing and making decisions. 
- Constant redundancies and refusal to backfill has led to remaining employees working 2-3, sometimes even 4 FTE’s worth of workload. 
- Poor processes and systems (Google sheets to make all decisions…) mean even simple tasks take hours, further accelerating the workload issues. 
- Paralysis by analysis. It’s rare a decision can just simply be made without consulting 10 or more different stakeholders and it is not clear who has accountability. 
- Obsession with annual planning. It derails BAU work. ‘Planning for Planning’ starts as early as June/July, followed by a chaotic 4/5 months as budgeting actually commences. In January, strategy will pivot, budget is declared unviable and focus moves to a reforecast resulting in a feeling of 6 months of wasted work. 

ONBOARDING
- You will not have one. 
- People will not offer to help you learn to use key systems and it’s very difficult to figure out who to ask. 

LEVELLING 
- Odd structure. It appears that most people are in more junior positions than they would be at comparable companies. Contributes to aggressive and competitive culture. 

PAY 
- Salary is average. 
- Benefits are poor; pension has a very low contribution from Deliveroo."

Even though I received regularly good performance reviews for years whilst I worked here, the assessment process isn't very transparent. It became transparent the longer I stayed here that leadership have no clue what they are doing and keep shifting goals and priorities with poor communication across the business - Will Shu really should pass the business on to someone with more business acumen, as he is out of his depth. The company showed little respect for staff throughout both rounds of redundancies (I was there for both), including the CEO Will, where on the day hundreds of employees were being let go he was sharing content about other things around the business with no consideration for how everyone around the company was feeling. I would not recommend working here if you want to be respected individually rather than your output, I personally stayed for as long as I did as it provided job security and salary throughout the pandemic as the business boomed."

You get shouted at for doing your job better than everyone else but miss out on 1 small metric which is impossible to achieve. There is 0 career progression available. Ive seen people deserve promotions and be completely ignored by the company. Nearly every single BDM has left the greater london team and its all because of how the director runs this team into the ground.

There exists a significant potential for exponential expansion if one is able to speak tamil and adhere unquestioningly to the directives of the boss and his favorites.,"I concur with the recent review and have observed multiple instances during my tenure where a lack of work ethics is evident among certain individuals. It appears that there may be a perception of favoritism towards specific employees by recruitment head, which has resulted in a sense of unfair treatment among other team members. These people hold a disproportionate amount of decision-making authority, which jeopardizes the company's ability to operate fairly. It is regrettable that a business of this magnitude is perceived as operating like a small family-owned business, where personal relationships take precedence over fairness and merit. Those who reject it or disagree with it run the risk of being excluded. The influence of boss extend to the human resource creating a situation where the company is being run solely according to his preferences. With regards to a review provided by another female employee, the working conditions are deemed to be extremely inadequate, and one must become accustomed to receiving derogatory comments and attitudes, unless they are from chenai. The presence of institutional racism and ethnic discrimination within this company is evident. It is my recommendation to refrain from engaging with virtusa.

Unless you're a native Tamilian, the working environment is like working in hell. Tamil is a frequently used language in offices and numerous meetings when people ask each other questions they don't want you to know. It's common to look at somebody, say something in Tamil, and then laugh. For lunch and supper, only certain employees are invited. We are never even invited, but they always order extra food to take home and expense it in our name. These guys act in a very petty manner while earning a significant wage from the corporation. You can anticipate another staff member from Chennai when a USA employee is fired. We are viewed as underperforming employees because they don't share any knowledge or consider us to be a part of the team. The rules are different for everybody, and you have to forget about promised raises and promotions if you don't fall into that family. you have to accept them, otherwise you will be demoted or given a task to complete without any help or information, at which point your boss will continue to put you down in front of everyone until you breakdown. you can never win a fight with your boss and your boss will make you realize the power he has. On the other hand, mani is a sinister and often makes vulgar comments, he is protected by boss. It's normal for them to miss work even on a family birthday, but if you have a medical emergency, you'll have to provide justification for the next few weeks and you'll always be ridiculed, even criticized. called old."

No increment in pay even after working for years and bonus is close to nothing 3. No professional growth plan for team member
Virtusa,1,45146,Technology Consultants sweat shop,Associate Architect,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",,Time entry is pretty easy and you get your paycheck when they say you will.,"Where do I start? This company has a distinctly ""foreign"" mindset. Being mostly composed of Indian and Sri Lankan employees, especially in upper management, it is a hard thing for someone born in the U.S. to get used to. To them, you are just a number, not a person. Are you earning for the company or not. A large part of your review is based on % of utilization. In other words are you earning for the company and in a contract. As a technologist you have very little control over this. This is wholly the purview of the sales team. So if they aren't bringing in work, you will get punished for it. If you aren't Indian or Sri Lankan, steer clear of this company and run for the hills. You will thank me."

Some individuals exhibit arrogant and self-absorbed behavior while boss laughs off, particularly towards women employees, which is creating a disruptive atmosphere. there is a dysfunctional management and no involvement from human resources. Apparent preference for promoting and nurturing growth exclusively among male tamilian employees, while there are limited opportunities for nontamilian staff members. This discrepancy has led to discontentment among the diverse workforce. Furthermore certain US employees are being asked to resign without involvement of hr, while the company actively engages in visa filings for tamilian employees.

They also hired several people who seemed super excited for their first step into telecom sales, and within months, I've seen their excitement turn into dismay and exits from the company.

Lumen,1,45291,Hunger Games environment,Senior Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",,Remote work and the benefits are good,"You've read about the layoffs. Those happen in a lot of companies. How they do it has screwed the enterprise. The people to be let go as part of the RIF is decided at the vice president level, not directors or managers...the VP who sorts the list of people by how much they are paid and they RIF the people at the top of the pay scale. The company hardly has any SME's left. Common practice for the only person who knows how a system works to get RIF'd. The company has more or less lobotomized itself. Ability to turn up new service and keep existing systems working has been gutted. Infrastructure is failing due to age. Many critical systems and platforms are 20 years old in many cases. When a platform is retired from being many years past end of life, it is replaced with used equipment that is also past end of life but not as much. Replacement parts are bought from ebay. 

New CEO is an improvement over the one that was fired a year ago, but her big changes has mostly been hiring on additional presidents and VPs. The company is very top-heavy. She's changing the culture of the company based off of a self help book called Dare to Lead. The obsession with this book and the lady who wrote it is approaching Kool Aid cult levels. They just restructured the companies debt. This was after the stock hit 80 cents a share. The creditor are going to end up owning what's left of the company in a couple years. The asset sale to Apollo wrecked the enterprise. All of the free cash flow came from the ILEC that they sold to them.
If you take a job here get as much as you can when you start because you'll go years before seeing a raise, and what you get won't be a lot. They fired all of their recruiters a few years ago and turned it all over to ""Hirevue"" which is a data mining outfit that in order to even be considered for a job, you have to make a dozen tick-tock style videos for them and play some games.

The company is desperately trying to turn around so there is adrenaline pumping all the time.,HR is controlled by what has been called the 'mean girl network'! There are several deceitful and manipulative senior leaders in HR that will do anything to protect themselves. These senior HR leaders created a completely toxic HR environment that spread into the business. They covered for senior business leaders' lying and helped hide their poor performance.

Ricoh,3,45240,Transformative Leadership and Corporate Renewal in the Current Economic Climate,Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Japan, PA","My department tended to progress projects from a business perspective. Although it was possible to rely on one of the swift ones for design etc., the motivation was difficult to maintain because there were many occasions where probes would suddenly become worn out. Additionally, there was a certain number of employees who did not work, imposing a burden on the employees of the new system, and I think there were also those who were forced to choose between changing jobs or not doing too much overtime.","The background that spares no effort in promoting innovation in manufacturing in-house for hardware, software, and supplies, is the low entry barriers from other industries. Sennen, whom the innovative brigade and the material company Whanny have supported for a long time, is likely to step into concentrated investment in the originators of the next generation technology, Realarne.

Ricoh,1,45257,Sad Dinosaur Afflicted With Nepotism,"Sr. Manager, Content Marketing","Former Employee, more than 1 year",,Good benefits but not worth forgetting everything you've learned.,"From the CMO to VPs and managers, they were all buddies from an aging tech company. Website forms didn't work, buyers were given no content to help make buying decisions, the company had dozens of email marketers but literally couldn't even send an email. It was like walking into a marketing department in the 90s before a company had a CRM. Leaders were 50-60 yo women who couldn't talk about data intelligently. Every 4 months reorganization with the leadership never changing bc they were all cronies from various companies while leads literally dropped more than 50% y/y. I'd seen more sophisticated marketing 15 years ago in a company half that sized. Truly sad to see a once-great company become a shell of itself. I participated in a diversity and inclusion council where we had to recruit an African American member after winning the company's award for best diversity council in the country. Never thought I'd see a diversity council headed by a bunch of white women whose idea of diversity activities was volunteering at food pantries. Company spent millions on a new marketing program and didn't even have the capabilities to inform their customers of their new branding. Truly one of the saddest marketing departments I've ever experienced."

So if you want any real wage be prepared to wait! Also, the site I was at had a very toxic environment and it became very draining. When trying to make changes it would fall on deaf ears.

Leadership is cleaning house and bringing in their own people, so if you have worked with current leadership in the past, now is the time to apply! Service and IT side of the business has had great success and leadership. If you play the political game, you will fit in.","Change is inevitable in every organization, but when you have a new CEO and CMO nearly every year it makes it impossible to adapt and evolve to an every-changing business strategy. Constant reorganizations and layoffs leaves a culture of fear. Company has rebranded twice in 2-3 years. The consequences of poorly-managed organizational transformation has been devastating. Marketing changes goals so often before implementation has even happened. CMO and Leadership are self-serving at the cost of the workers. Do not expect to bring ideas to the table to make improvements, because leadership already knows what to do. Marketing leadership, including CMO has a lack of care, lack of transparency, lack of trust, enlarged ego, unwillingness to listen to employees, and are lacking passion and charisma. If you are a hard worker, you will get rewarded with more work or a layoff, not a pat on the back or a raise. Lots of money spent on new marketing initiatives with failing results.

CSC,4,42612,5 great years spent at CSC,Infrastructure Architect,Former Employee,"Atlanta, GA",I really loved working at CSC up until about 1 year after Mike Lawrie became CEO. The pay was competitive but I most enjoyed the job because of the people I worked directly with. Having joined the company mid-career I was fortunate to pick up on some great experiences that continue to carry me forward for other career opportunities. My role was 100% remote with travel to customer facilities which I very much enjoyed. I was always able to look forward to some interesting travel which took me to places that I had never experienced.,I missed the childhood of my youngest because of the demand from travel. It was just part of the job. The company culture took a steep dive after Mike Lawrie came aboard to carve up the company to sell. Morale hit an all time low and I decided that CSC was no longer a place I could all home which led me to consider other job opportunities outside the company. I do miss my old peeps but staying would have been at the expense of my own health always wondering and worrying if the pink slip would shown up tomorrow. I still maintain a friendship with some of my old coworkers who tell me that things have not gotten any better; perhaps maybe even worse than when I left the company over 2 years ago. This reinforces that it was a good time for me to leave when I did.

Business unit heads have fair amount of freedom. Company is very visible and looks good on a resume. Pay is near-market, and merit increases are fairly reliable.","CSC is hemorrhaging money left and right and has been doing so since at least the 80s. Overpaid upper management can't stem the loss, so bonuses for sub-executives are gone, benefits are slashed, and the bench system- where if your business unit closes then you are put on retainer until a new opening appears- is gone. When I started 3 years ago, I could afford the PPO for my whole family, now I can barely manage the HDCP.

The company is so large that management has their heads in the clouds about all this- employees drop or get laid off left and right and whole contracts are left to rot, while the CEO and national management hold lavish meetings and huge all-hands conferences to tell us how great everything is. How great is it? So great that the company just split in a desperate attempt to separate the reliable but low-earning public contracts from the bigger, riskier private ones.

CSC is a textbook example of a company that had it all then lost it due to bad management, and it has suffered as a workplace for it."

There are opportunities to move around if you know someone or if you have made an impression on a service delivery manager.,CSC negiotates bad unprofitable contracts and do not know how to generate new revenue from their existing customer base.  Many of there large accounts are in constant dispute over the contact and billing.   They also do not invest money into thier employees and lack a very intelligent offshoring plan.  Just dump a percent of onshore employees across all accounts with no understand of how they will get work done causes end customer headaches.  They also have a huge turnover rate of off shore employees which could be standard but also could be because most of the work given to offshore components have no opportunities for career growth also there is strong lack of respect and mistreatment to offshore worker.   There still seen as a threat then as a means to improve the skills and gworth of the on shore workers.

The work is interesting, I'm learning every week, my manager buys me the tools I need to do my job, my team leader is free with his praise of my work. We work hard and succeed, and we spend the time to joke and laugh. Immediate management listens to our ideas and runs interference for us when other people get on our case. Company pays for education and access to computer based training and a library of online books (books24x7). Again, there are many great, helpful, knowledgeable people working for CSC.","As a large company made up of many outsourcing accounts, experiences vary widely across the company. There are many groups of people whose loyalty lie more with their former employer, whom they still support, than for the wider CSC. This patchwork can make it hard to interact across account lines. Also, many people are still upset and concerned by the ongoing effort to get as many jobs offshore as possible as a way to save costs, and there is a push in some groups to have employees work from home as a cost cutting measure. It seems strange that some people have never physically met their direct manager. The company is currently reorganizing, and this means cost cutting and some downsizing."

Appears to believe that ""training programs"" are the answer to every challenge.

CSC has a generous but naive notion that ""anyone can be trained to do anything"" and doesn't particularly care whether workers have a matching academic background.  Many ot the employees and staff have degrees in totally unrelated areas (e.g. marine biology) and have never written a line of code in their lives.

CSC also provides a good balance to personal/professional life. They have decent sports and gym facilities made available for the employees. Salary structure was friendly. There's lot of emphasis on non-work related activities. Sometime Key Result Areas are defined around non-work related activities. This can be seen as positive or negative under different contexts. E.g, approx 40% or KRAs are defined on non-work related activities. If an employee has been working diligently to meet stiff delivery deadlines, he/she is bound to miss on those 40% KRA goals, severely affecting the performance appraisal.","No vision from senior management, no roadmap. Senior management has been seen clueless about growth plans for the India FSG unit

CSC India (FSG unit) is a cost center and hence follows a business model which purely services onsite teams and projects. There is no scope of control although employees are accountable for the piece of assignment they are working on. All my proactive suggestions were warded off as silly but management wanted to implement them 2 years later when client started demanding for those features. This is a clear showcase of short-sightedness seen in FSG unit's management. 

Recognition for one's accomplishments are purely on manager's discretion which is usually heavily biased on few people in the team. I can keep on writing more rants and raves but the fact is CSC FSG unit management is incompetent and short-sighted. I am pretty sure they still dont have any road map for the unit."
CSC,3,40060,Seasoned employees not held accountable for info distro,Systems Administrator Associate Professional,Former Employee,Stuttgart,Ability to move to other depts is good.,"Although you may get to another dept, salary does not change. Many employees prefer to stay put rather than accept more responsibility for no additional compensation. Then you get incompetencies (not ALL, but some)in back end departments simply because they were dumb enough to accept a move (or even worse, a supervisory position!) with absolutely no additional compensation.
Those who are in other depts do not inform front line of changes, many times, we would find out issues when the customer did (after the fact) and then find out something was pushed or a server rebooted/acting up hours prior."

It's full of crony management who have all ""sold their souls"" for the price of their lucrative bonuses and packages.  They are not interested in streamlining, in making processes better, or achieving efficiencies (which the real workers, the real talented people could bring in spades), and many have zero actual line management skills.  Mostly they appear focussed and ""bought into"" some bigger picture that the workers are not party to.  The end of year appraisal system is a devisive undefendable nonsense which the souless management have to carry out leaving real talented people starting to actually believe the unrealistic mediocre scoring they all receive to prevent promotions and pay rises.  In short, it's one big game and the senior managerment play it for all it's worth keeping the status quo going to keep their lucrative positions, all the while at the expense of real, good, talented people whose efforts often go unrewarded.  If you are prepared to sell your soul, play the game, tow the party line and not rock the boat, then I'm sure you will do well in which case roll up a trouser leg and arm sleeve and dive in."
CSC,3,41463,Senior programmer analyst position,Senior Programmer Analyst Professional,"Former Employee, more than 10 years","Bath, ME","CSC has good training resources with Skillsoft.  For the most part, they are supportive of their employees.","Here are some suggestions for improvement
The sick time policy does not reward good health.  CSC’s policy is “use it or lose it”.  You might want to consider what other companies are doing, such as General Dynamics.  They treat unused sick time as earned time, and buy it from the employee when terminating.
Unpaid extra hours – no benefit sharing.  When employees work extra hours at my client, CSC billed the full rate, and shared none of it with the employee.  You might want to consider sharing some of the extra revenue with the people who create it.
CSC has a good policy regarding customer service, but no policy regarding internal culture.  Internal teams can have hampered productivity because of friction and conflict.  A good source of information on internal culture is Dave Ramsey’s teachings, he’s had some good material in Entreleadership podcasts.  Here is a summary:
•	No gossip, no negative comments about others unless you are talking to someone who can solve the problem.  No hidden agendas.  Have humility.  Even the most brilliant among us have made dumb statements and decisions.
•	Have grace for others.  No disagreements except at public meetings.  It is OK to have conflict, calm is not the goal.  If you’re fuming inside, talk about it with the right person.
•	Treat others with dignity and respect.  Have praise.
QA procedures – there is some redundancy and overlap.  Example: the project definition and BSDR have overlapping content."

The company is also big enough that it is possible to attach yourself to the coattails of  a good manager and follow his or her career. The corporate culture also emphasizes a good word/life balance. Since most of the business is geared towards the government where extra hours mean extra pay, there is seldem pressure to work beyond a 40 hour workweek.

Most other companies in the industry have eliminated sick leave.","The internal employee ""portal"" is horrible. This is supposed to be a technology company, and we have this for a collaboration site? Anything you need to find is buried 5 layers deep and only accessable through counter-intuitive links. The search function is worthless. Now that that's out of the way, the downsides of the company are related to the upsides - you could be on a project with a horrible manager. As long as the contract is in progress, management doesn't seem to care about the quality of the local management either.

Recently they have come up with concept of variable hike. where you have two components Base+Variable. Suppose you received total 8% hike which includes (3+5). Means you will receive 3% base hike this year and Rest 5% is performance tied, that you will receive in next year, Mean you may not get full 5% next year and + next years base %. Overall it is one the unique thing to make you fool and CSC has such fool or Should we call them cunning HR who comes up with such weird things.

1. Employee friendly and transparent policies.
2. Great infrastructure and services for employees, rarely found in Indian MNCs like TCS, HCL, Infy etc. Like HRs are available anytime at toll free numbers to clear any query.
3. Above market salaries. But this is now a bit undone by introduction of variable pay in 2014.

6. Good onsite opportunities.","1. The company is struggling to have a foothold  in India.
2. From the learning perspective, there is not much to learn and grow
3. There is not much or trivial work for senior developers like me in many projects, as a result the technical skillset  and learning-curve becomes stagnant.
4. There is a sense of job insecurity everytime. There are constant talks about layoffs every quarter end.
5. Lowest rated employees are asked to resign after appraisal cycle.

There is a general feeling that the company values its employees. We frequently receive notices about upcoming training opportunities.

At my work site, managers allow great flexibility in personal schedule, and there is no dress code. It's a very comfortable, casual atmosphere. As long as we get our work done, things are mostly great.","Compensation, including benefits, for professionals seems to be a little below average. We used to be allowed to accrue up to twice our annual vacation allowance. Now the annual allowance is the maximum. As a result, new employees (1st 4 years) can't take vacations longer than 2 weeks.
I normally don't pay close attention to company issues - I focus on doing my work. But there is a disturbingly frequent sense among my peers that senior management are making decisions that are designed to reward themselves (through bonuses), and negatively impact employees (e.g., the recent change in vacation policy, and elimination of  of of the retirement plans)."

The biggest delivery centers are in India with a combined head count of 23000 employees. The second biggest is in Vietnam which has a head count of 800. You can see how skewed is the delivery distribution. 
It takes pride in comparing with other services companies like Infosys and wipro. Where as considering it's size and historical background it should be compared with product companies like Microsoft and Oracle.
It tries to do a catch up game on most technologies and more over there is a big gap in marketing.
LEF and Delivery gaps are very wide.
There is a step motherly treatment for Delivery centers. E.g. there is no reason social networking sites should be blocked in India and open in other locations.

That way when the monthly reports to the VP were presented, I was the fall guy. I was RIFed and the XDir was demoted because the review board finally caught on to what he was doing. I think by now he has been fired. I was the one that made the recommendations to get the project back on track, but this would have made him look bad because he ran the program for 3 years. He only wanted a scape goat. I'll get off of my soap box now."

The company does not seem to know how to reduce costs other than to cut people.    Never any budget to support the tools and training that employees need to excel in their roles.

So many staff have quit to move on to much better jobs.

Local management are either: 
* fantastic and overworked
Or 
* completely unqualified and floundering but somehow safe from ramification. It's strange and toxic when you hear them blaming everyone but themselves. 

Good staff are overworked and not overly well appreciated. No access to superstar staff who could help junior/ new staff as they don't have time.

Culture of panic has developed,  caused by constant fire fighting and customer escalations. Sounds harsh,  but it is true in my experience. Some managers are great at dealing with this,  some are terrible."

The CEO's strategic objective is to offshore as much work as possible so they undersell. You will likely never hear anything from management except thru email.  Your deadlines will be unreasonable.  You will most likely feel like constant CHAOS, because good PM's don't exist.  Regarding the no minimum vacation....be careful with this ""benefit"", because the likelihood of vacation approval above a typical service norm is rare and with resource constraints and aggresive deadlines, you will never meet your deadlines.  With luck, you may have a manager with heart. More likely you will never meet them and they will be cold and heartless. Denying you a sense of enjoyment at work.  All groups are grossly understaffed.

CSC,2,40834,Just a paycheck,Help Desk,Current Employee,,They can pay you. I do enjoy fixing peoples problems and we had tools to do so. They did allow me to use my sick time and vacation when I needed it. I did receive some praise from the projects I developed from immediate management until they were replaced when new management came in (see below),Senior Management does not listen to reason. Had ideas for several projects and way to improve efficiency that were flatly rejected or not encouraged. Very little in the way of raises. Bottom line over customer service and employee sanity. The one factor in all of this is the company I worked for was bought out by CSC when I got hired. We were treated like a red headed step child and when they did finally decide to be involved in our lives they tried to fit us into their mold which did not work. I dont know how the CEO Mike Laphen is even involved with us since we probably dont even show up on his radar. Corporation is too big and has lost its soul. The tools they gave us to use were antiquated and broken half the time. We did not have enough people to cover the work they gave us. Were encouraged to do more with less.

Generally very accommodating in terms of time off. Benefits are OK. If you know what to make of your career and growth, it can be a good place. Not cliquish but there is an expectation to develop your own network of colleagues and promote your abilities. Overall quite a good place to work at.","Lack of sense of community. This may not be a big issue for senior resources who have learned to direct their own careers but may be more challenging for junior folks. Although progress is being made, there is room for improvement in branding CSC as a whole ... lack of identity to some degree. More focus and support in developing high potential resources would be a plus. Most consultants tend to be treated somewhat equally which is fair enough but may be discouraging for those who 'go the extra mile'... it would be good to have tiered incentive schemes to recognize strong performers.

Offices are open post pandemic but the choice is given to teams to manage their work based on what suits their situation. Great leadership. Company did really well during the pandemic and was really considerate taking care of employee situation. Quite diverse and inclusive culture. Overall all the positives outweigh the negatives and a good place to further career.",The company is growing at a rapid pace and hence there are teething issues when it comes to processes and procedures clarity.

Lot of learning opportunities if you are willing to learn. UST deals with multiple technologies. Gives us flexibility to move inside different projects.","I have been with UST for many years. Mostly its a people centric company not a process driven one. Managers are mostly old timers and they don't like the people under them grow. Most leaders are not leaders they are typical Bosses. Visionaries are less. Company boast about profits every year, but as an employee my question is what's in it for a regular employee. 

There is hardly a bonus unless your manager puts some efforts to get you something. Company talks a lot about Humanity, Humility, etc but are we really following it from the grass level. Leaders should take effort to understand the root level of the problems. Why are we not becoming an Infosys, Wipro, TCS. If we dig deep we will understand.

Good resources are not paid well and we should have 360 degree feedback system. Why cant an employee give feedback about manager? Lot of internal politics."

Everything is just better. The people-first focus is so loud and clear to my experience so far. I've referred nearly 10 people in my 6 months. I'm VERY interested to see my career journey unfold here. I could see myself growing into different roles. 

A few highlights:
- Unlimited PTO (& everyone means it and encourages PTO)
- True flexibility in a remote/hybrid environment (no pressure to be online and responsive 24/7, everyone is human here)
- Competitive, negotiable pay
- Incredible transparency from the C-suite
- Focus & resources on development
- People do what they say they will do","Joining any company has its challenges. Still, I've had virtually very little since joining. 

My challenges include:
- Finding the right stakeholders across a large, matrixed environment to collaborate with
- Being in a role that is new & unique. No one else on my team does what I do or anything similar 
- Not a ton of visibility into everything in the works from my leader (Which would help me in planning new ideas + moving things forward)
- Learning the products & services. There's a lot, it's a learning curve that everyone is on"
ServiceNow,5,45328,Amazing company to work at,Product Strategist,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Los Angeles, CA","- A+ culture. Vast majority of people are kind, approachable, hardworking, smart, ambitious
- Great work life balance
- Excellent compensation, yearly bonus, benefits, unlimited PTO (actively encouraged and tracked with your manager - not a sham) 
- One of the few if only tech companies right now with high morale
- Exciting growth period, especially as company hits financial targets ahead of schedule
- Investment in personal development
- Commitment to DE&I, volunteering, generous stipends to donate to non-profits
- Flexible WFH policy. No mandates so far to return to office, which is also rare for tech companies these days
- MyServiceNow is the best onboarding and employee hub I've ever used. Incredible AI integrations where you can find contacts, information, glossaries, etc. with one search","- Onboarding contains a lot of content, especially if you're not familiar with ServiceNow's platform operability. However, as mentioned above, the onboarding platform is incredible and helps you stay on track. Your manager also gives you time to get this done 
- Pace is extremely quick, which can sometimes create gaps in communication and task delegation
- ServiceNow has so many products within its platform - focus on learning the basics of the products most relevant to your line of work"
ServiceNow,5,45281,Best Culture and Best Tech in the Business,Customer Success Manager,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",,"There is a genuine commitment and distinctive vibe when it comes to values. Inclusion and belonging exceeds the positive values that is communicated. It's no surprise ServiceNow is highlighted for so many workforce categories, but the one that energizes me most is America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity.

The company is a global tech hub. All teams across departments are diverse and assembled with talented folks. Our success can be attributed to our high influential CEO and the strategic decision making of the leadership team. From the P4 to your direct manager and peer teammates are top caliber individuals in the technology industry. Goals and expectations are personalized so that you are evolving professionally. ServiceNow celebrates your achievements and is a steadfast champion.

The office spaces, perks, and employee benefits are super nice. Flexible work arrangements and family-oriented programs so that you are able to do your best work and live well. A good mix of company events and social activities across the company. Professional development opportunities are endless at ServiceNow. 

The platform stays fresh and ahead of market trends with regular enhancements. Customers have a range of selections to maximize the value of the technology. Robust security measures to protect customer data and build trust. First movers in multiple verticals. I've worked in the big five tech, and I am blown away at how much new innovation is live in the current release and road mapped for future releases. ServiceNow is the largest rocket ship I have ever been on!",I wish I joined ServiceNow sooner because this has been my best tech experience in over 10 years.
ServiceNow,3,45335,Great Presentation with Underlying Problems,Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Vienna, VA","ServiceNow talks a big game and in many ways follows through. The C-Suite is largely competent and their performance has consistently led to the stock price increasing.

Broadly, the company culture is supportive and talks a big game when it comes to DEI. Broadly, the company lives up to its stated goals but experiences vary depending on the team. 

The company is a rocket ship and the momentum is palpable.","Your experience at ServiceNow will depend on the team that you are on.

Managers run their teams as their own personal fiefdoms and experiences can vary. Some managers are not qualified for their jobs. 

The company's public sector strategy is not good. Recent hiring decisions have made it clear the company prioritizes short term gain over long term sustainability. This will likely negatively affect ServiceNow in the long run."
ServiceNow,2,45266,"Great people, terrible processes",Senior Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Santa Clara, CA","Overwhelmingly the greatest people you will ever work with - smart, hard working, and kind to each other
Whatever experience you want to grow professionally, you will find it here
CEO Bill McDermott is inspiring everytime he talks - he is a true visionary and the company is fortunate to have him","Most processes (ironically) are still very manual. As the company grows and changes, the tools and technology aren't updated leaving teams with unmanageable amounts of manual work. This is raised as biggest issue every year in employee feedback surveys, but nothing ever improves, just more manual work to compensate for bad tools and processes
Lots of pressure from leaders to deliver results, but no direction or support to improve - they promise it, then back out when it's time to deliver on their promises - yet they still expect perfect execution from their teams
Most teams are completely burned out - unrealistic expectations and demands without support. No time to do anything but work - no time for learning, career development, or even vacation (time off = work builds up, so you either work while on vacation and/ or work even more hours when you're back just to get caught up)"
ServiceNow,2,45322,Mixed experiences in my first month at ServiceNow France,Regional Partnership Manager,Current Employee,,"Competitive Salaries: the compensation at ServiceNow is commendable and aligns well with industry standards.
Product : AWESOME platform !!!!!","Cultural disconnect: The work culture in the French office seems misaligned with the global ethos of ServiceNow. This has been a significant concern during my initial days here.
Onboarding challenges: My onboarding experience was marred by delays and a lack of support. The delayed delivery of my laptop significantly hampered my ability to start effectively, and the response from my manager added to the stress rather than alleviating it.
Age dynamics: The average age at the office appears to skew over 50, creating an implicit bias towards younger employees like myself. This age dynamic seems to affect perceived credibility and acceptance within the team.
Work-life balance: There's an unspoken expectation to work long hours, which is not necessarily linked to productivity or efficiency. This old-school mentality clashes with the innovative image projected by ServiceNow externally.
Limited diversity in Recruitment: The hiring pattern predominantly favors candidates from specific former employers (X-Oracle, X-Salesforce, X-Microsoft), which leads to a lack of diverse perspectives in the workplace."
ServiceNow,5,45321,"Great first year, excited for the future!",Renewal Account Manager,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Amsterdam,"It has been a great experience working at ServiceNow. From the hiring process, to onboarding, ramping up with fellow new hires, as well as getting the trust and support from my teammates has been nothing short of fantastic. When joining, coming from a small software company that I've been a part of for nearly 13 years, I did wonder if I was going to be 'one of many' and would get lost in such a large organization. ServiceNow has proven to me over the past year that this fear could not be further from the truth; I feel welcomed and really experienced that I directly contribute to how well ServiceNow is doing, together with my direct team and everyone!","As ServiceNow has been growing so incredibly fast, there are some systems & processes that are only now catching up to where they need to be. ServiceNow has been transparent with me what these challenges were and they have been open to critical feedback, all with the intention of becoming better."

They keep culture at the center, but I would encourage leadership to make sure not to lose sight of it as we continue to climb up.","A lot of growing pains because we are scaling so quickly as a company. Lots of operational rigor that is needed, but everybody is moving too fast that the systems and processes that need to be in place aren't being placed fast enough."
ServiceNow,3,45324,Some Growing Up To Do,Sales,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Atlanta, GA","The company's stock is doing well. So, get RSUs. Pays on the upper end of market -- Insurance was average. Products seem good, perhaps a bit pricey. Not overly high pressure - which ends up being a con if you're looking for commissions.","It's a product-driven company with no real sales discipline to speak of. They haven't figured out account-based selling, differing to reactionary transactions driven by the customer, ignoring a prescriptive vision and roadmap for the account. That worked at the outset but will limit growth to the next level if they want to get dollars outside of IT."

The leaders here communicate everything that is going on with the company i.e. our successes, new technology, no layoffs last year! We hit our numbers because the attitude here is just refreshing! I wish more could see how great this company is and will be in 20 years! Come join us this year!",I really don't have any cons working here.

Strong products and engineering organization. The ""hungry and humble"" culture is real and awesome. If you are a specialist and find the team that needs your specialized skills in the company, this is truly a great place to work.","Very frequent turn-over and reorgs at the SVP and VP levels means frequently changing priorities and having to justify / defend teams and budgets again and again.

ServiceNow,3,45261,Awards don't tell the full story,Senior Solution Consulting Manager,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Nashville, TN","Amazing people - helpful, genuine, very few jerks. Highly collaborative culture and most employees do embrace the ""hungry and humble"" mantra. Great benefits. Lots of training opportunities and truly supportive of internal mobility. Products are spectacular, which makes them easier to sell.","Over the last 6 years, as revenue and stock price have skyrocketed, even through the pandemic, our CEO goes on CNBC every time we release financial results to talk about how awesome we're doing, how we're leading the market in so many metrics (which we are). 

The problem is, every year we get fewer headcount to grow our teams, less money to award for raises, less stock to hand out to top talent as a retention tool. We've recently added forced ranking to employee performance reviews and put a significant downward squeeze on promotions and a complete halt to any off-cycle promotions. Span of control for managers is being hiked from 7 to 10. This represents a MASSIVE disconnect, and it's not sustainable. You can't have both sides of that coin - the company is doing great but we don't have a travel budget. You can't brag about how awesome the firm is doing and be genuine in thanking the employees for their hard work that's getting us there, and then also say ""there's no money for raises, promotions, or new headcount, do more with less and be glad we haven't had layoffs."" Top execs are absolutely taking advantage of the fact that this is a crap economy which makes it hard for people to leave. 

They've basically adopted the Jack Welch curve for performance - forcing managers to score 60% of employees as ""middle of the road."" Anyone scored above average they now make managers write a book report to justify it. That's not uncommon, and it would work fine at HP or IBM where you expect to be operating inside a corporate bureaucratic beast that treats you like a number. But that's not why people come to ServiceNow. It's ridiculously hard to get into ServiceNow these days because so many people are looking to leave that kind of nonsense. Except, now that nonsense is creeping in here, too. You can't hire the cream of the crop (which we've really worked hard to do) and then tell 60% of them they're ""solid, middle of the road"" performers. It creates huge dissonance."

Lenovo,2,45327,Gradually losing the plot,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,"Morrisville, NC","My direct colleagues are some of the brightest people I have ever worked with, good benefits package.","Old, out of touch, senior management is slowly deteriorating the culture of the company. For a company who wants to pride themselves on innovation and being on the cutting edge, you won't find any people in leadership who aren't old men, over the age 45 who are all stuck in the past. Many of them are IBM relics and their management style and priorities show. No projects or initiatives are about advancing the mission of the company and is instead all about internal optics, pontificating, and doing favors for their buddies on other teams, and the people in the middle and bottom are getting absolutely crushed as a result. Pay hasn't been competitive in years. Just when employees were finally enjoying their WFH flexibility as a result of COVID (during which we saw increased employee engagement scores and our greatest all-time revenue generated), senior leadership is now forcing workers to come in 3 days a week and are tracking WiFi signals to verify they are in the office for a full day. There have been no perks introduce to ease employees in, not even free coffee for a Fortune 500 company, and on any given day, 65% of the external monitors will not work."

What keeps me here is the people, the work flexibility, and interesting work. I have a supportive boss and there no drama in the group. Everyone wants to help one another and doesn't complain. I set my own schedule, so long as I get my work done. We are now hybrid and I like the mix. Lenovo has an open work place and we were hybrid before Covid. There are usually weekly events that you can attend if you are on-site, ie. personal development and wellness workshops, seminars to learn more about the business etc.",The systems and processes seem behind for a large global company and the base pay seems less competitive than similar companies. Benefits are competitive.

They sponsor people from overseas who do not have any culture fit which makes work harder. Pushing is the only way to get result what they want without appreciation. Some people look nice but political, the rest all live in another culture. Lenovo is just a based Sydney company but not Australian at all, people you work with has problem control themselves emotions, easily go stress then you are the only one to hold the crap.

they have a business model that encourages new employees in and get the old ones out or make them uncomfortable.

I went an entire year working remote, and not one manager reached out to me to give me a heads up on my performance, and the only times they will reach out is to tell you how bad you are doing and will falsify Quality Assurance scores, to encourage you to feel as though you don't belong or you're not doing a good job. Furthermore, they don't encourage promoting within, when you try to go for a higher position, they will ignore you or just tell you it's no longer available. There is definitely favoritism at this place for sure, those they like they will ignore their bad, and continue to give them praise, but if they don't like you...

they will falsify scores, to make you feel stupid
they will write you up by micromanaging you, making you feel like you need to be on your best behavior.
then they will just complete Freeze you out, and won't speak to you, but only to let you know that you need to get your act together, even though you have been there for 5 years.

I've never felt so cold and alone at this job. there are so many Mental Days that i've had to take, and i never would have thought a company like this would tear down my mental health as this job has.

Be at this job for at least 6 months to a year, and please get out as soon as possible, because the longer you stay, the more they will find ways to see how they can get you out of there.

Oh yeah, forget about your free time, because you will be working 5 days a week, 50 hours, so yeah, the time for you to be able to do things with friends, you can say goodbye to that."

From the moment I joined, I was exposed to a culture of fear, intimidation, and backstabbing. It's a daily struggle to navigate the political landmines just to keep your job. Poor Leadership: The company is rife with incompetent and unqualified leadership. It's not uncommon to witness leaders belittling employees, displaying favoritism, and making arbitrary decisions that negatively impact the team. They lack transparency and often hide crucial information from employees. Unreasonable Expectations: The workload at this company is beyond excessive, and you're expected to work long hours, including nights and weekends, without overtime pay. The constant pressure to meet unrealistic targets takes a toll on your mental and physical health. Lack of Respect for Work-Life Balance: The company doesn't respect the concept of work-life balance. Expect to be on call 24/7, even during your vacations or personal time. It's nearly impossible to disconnect from work, leading to burnout and strained personal relationships. High Turnover: Due to the toxic environment, poor leadership, and excessive demands, the company experiences a high turnover rate. Talented employees leave as soon as they find better opportunities, which further contributes to the toxic cycle. Stagnant Career Growth: Career growth and development opportunities are virtually non-existent. Promotions are based on favoritism rather than merit, and it's disheartening to see hardworking individuals overlooked for advancement. In conclusion, this company is a prime example of a toxic work environment. If you value your mental and emotional well-being, I strongly advise you to steer clear of this organization. Look for companies that respect their employees, promote a healthy work-life balance, and provide growth opportunities. Your career and overall happiness deserve better than what this company has to offer."

The company's culture of innovation fosters creativity and pushes employees to think outside the box. This emphasis on innovation creates a dynamic work environment where associates can contribute to cutting-edge projects and technologies. Workday prioritizes work-life balance, providing flexible schedules and remote work options that enable effective management of professional and personal commitments. The supportive environment encourages collaboration, fostering camaraderie among teams. The company invests in employees' growth through various training programs and advancement opportunities, ensuring they have resources to thrive. Overall, working at Workday offers the chance to make a meaningful impact, grow professionally, and be part of a forward-thinking culture.","While there are benefits to working at Workday, there are also drawbacks to consider. The fast-paced nature of the work environment can be overwhelming for some individuals, requiring a high level of flexibility and resilience. High expectations for performance may lead to stress and burnout, particularly for those who prefer a more relaxed work environment. Achieving work-life balance may be challenging, especially in roles with on-call availability or tight deadlines. Navigating the complex organizational structure may require time and effort, particularly for new employees. The competitive atmosphere, while driving innovation, may not suit everyone, particularly those who prefer a more collaborative work environment. Despite these drawbacks, the benefits of working at Workday make it an attractive option for many full-time associates."
Workday,3,45028,Good People with a Slipping Culture,Senior Principal Consultant,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,Individuals still believe in the culture that was present when we joined. Time Off flexibility is still good at least in the teams I've been part of. Great healthcare benefits,"Lack of transparency and sense of company direction. We talk a good game but have lost our commitment to customer and instead are focusing on flashy sponsorships, company acquisitions, and developing large amounts of low-quality content to give the appearance of progress. Layoffs. We were told we wouldn't be laying off, then they said the layoffs would be limited, but we gave the laid off workers rules around what they could and could not say to give a flowery appearance while threatening the livelihoods of the talent we let go. Many job offers rescinded and forced to re-apply or kicked out due to the new back to office policy. Baseless 'return to office' requirements. Sheri is mandating new roles be located near offices significantly reducing talent pool. We have yet to see any real data supporting the claims for their decisions. Pay cuts disguised as updated compensation philosophy. Good ol' boy culture among Sr Management and above. The executive teams are very preppy and there is no defined path to leadership, only the in-crowd seems to get promoted."

Highly intelligent and capable for the most part.,"Where to start? When I first joined WD it was an incredible place. I felt like it was too real to be true. Unfortunately I was right. After much turmoil, an org restructure, layoffs and then a new organization - we finally settled with terrible middle management. The entire Org is constantly giving feedback especially about management but the feedback falls on deaf ears.  Leadership is detrimental, turnover is happening at a high rate and there are rumors of ethics complaints and a potential discrimination class action lawsuit coming together because of bullying, harassment, and discrimination. Morale is incredibly low. Work is incredibly overloaded and if you complain you are pushed out. If you are suspected of giving negative feedback you become a target. Fear drives the org. It’s incredible work we are doing, But the treatment received is toxic and abusive. Leadership continues to pat themselves on the back but it’s ridiculous when the team is running on fumes except those with preferential treatment.   I am really happy to be out but feel so bad for everyone else that has been left behind. GPO really has to get rid of the toxic leadership to avoid not only a lawsuits, but the breakdown of the organization."

High workload, if you are looking for work life balance, this is not the place for you, at least not in the SRE space. 10-12 hours days are quite common.

This place is hyped up but do not fall for it. After working tirelessly for close to four years to build a whole team from the ground up, I was asked to leave with a meagre severance package. The initial shock was unfathomable. Every person that I worked with including my own team (that I also build from scratch) was shattered and thought I was joking when I said I was being asked to leave. The impact that we had created as a team was large and the change that I orchestrated was felt through out the company and I had won accolades and many recommendations and reviews for it. My manager knew nothing about our business area but was still asked to lead a significant charter including my team which she knew absolutely nothing about. She was close to a certain someone in the C-suite. She was asked to leave a few months after I left but the damage was done and irreversible. No one questioned her and I had to leave a thriving team and work behind. Now they have opened a role again and it is the same role that I had. Why wasn't I given that opportunity when my team and I proved our worth so many times through such impactful work? It is dirty politics. It is a SHAM! Please BEWARE!!"

I truly did enjoy most of my time at Workday.","AWFUL middle managers. My Director was based in the UK and he was a complete joke. So arrogant and cocky. He came into the team and was just a tyrant within our organization and never provided actual constructive criticism. He brought in a few other employees from his last role and they all 3 were just on their own planet and acted so much more superior than everyone else. I never understood their attitudes just because they came from another enterprise company. My 2 direct people leaders, my other colleagues, other teammates within my organization were all fantastic, but this one director was just a joke. Shame that he is still there, but he is arrogant and that fits in with Workday leadership styles."

Workday,3,45021,Please listen to your workers,Manager,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Pleasanton, CA","Overall, it's a decent place and people still want Workday to be what is advertised. Generally, there is respect for individuals","* Understanding how to operate as a diverse workplace is largely lacking. Rather than updating our ""game"" and making new inclusive ways of working, people who have different backgrounds or approaches are seen as low performers and get pushed out. * Managers talk and gossip about employees entirely too much. It's unfair to the individual especially when they don't hear the feedback directly or given a chance to share their side. *Org leaders don't know what is going on with their teams. They are too busy helping sales or making the senior leaders happy with unhelpful processes to spend time on managing people. * Internal applications to other positions require current manager approval, which makes the process difficult. You are treated differently as soon as they know you're interested in something else. There can be micro-retaliations that are hard to prove, but you can feel it. When we apply outside of the company, no one knows. Why is it acceptable to require we share for internal?"

No company is perfect and not everyone can be pleased about everything and everyone but ""saying"" what your model is and ""being"" what your model is is different. My experience for my direct leader to senior leadership is that the company is really does try to put it's employees first and there is a constant temperature check to adapt and grow in that direction constantly.",If you just want to go to work and do your job and stay to yourself you probably won't like it there.

No transparency, blame culture for shifting priorities, revolving door of middle management leaves churn for ICs to pickup the pieces. WLB is out the window. First it was talk to your team about return to office. Then it was this hybrid work model. Now its sit here from 9-5 3 days a week and we monitor that you do so. I can only imagine what it is like for folks with kids. It is not flexible at all. Stock incentive for total comp is out the window unless you work in PLS. New goal setting strategy for management is glorified micromanagement. Toxic politics lead to a revolving door of middle management without room for internal promotion.

Many of us did not receive bonuses and merit increases this year with management making up excuses despite record profits. Layoffs (after the company lied to us) decimated morale. Return to office was sucking the life out of all of us. You didn’t pay us Apple and Google salaries to micromanage us 3 days a week?

Very small number of minority IC's within TA to include people leaders. People fear leveraging Peakon surveys for fear of retaliation from management. Many workmates feel they have no voice and it's best to hush up do your job and don't challenge. The process for recruiting minority talent across the board is really sad and slow. Most of the leaders received their roles from word a net work at Workday and NOT solely because they are the best qualified for the positions they have. Leadership, does not like the low numbers of minority/diverse talent and complain about it. When offered suggestions to do better and improve. Many leaders would argue with extreme tension/aggression but not willing to change their ways or processes. Workday places profit over it's employee's. A shame when Employee focus is claimed to be a core value. Many of my workmates lost their jobs right before the the super bowl 3% company wide.

A lot of favoritism in this division of the company and very little focus on meritocracy be it a promotion, an idea, or change.

Citrix,4,45116,Not as Bad as it Was,Support and Services,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",,"I've been at Citrix now for a long time, and I'm one of the more tenured individuals still at the company. I've been in multiple positions and can speak to how the teams are being managed. This entire review will be broken down with Before Acqusition and After Acquisition, since a lot of the other reviews keep mentioning how things were while wearing rose tinted glasses. Before Acqusition Pro's (No longer valid): ================================ - More team outtings, more team dinners, better team building activities. - Culture was better for smaller teams, and harder to improve for larger teams due to budgetary concerns. - Sales cycle was fine at first, became very convoluted towards the end - Publicly traded so we had the ability to do a Stock Purchase Plan - 1-2 Work-from-Home days for certain Orgs, or full remote for other Orgs. - Great new hire experience until we were fully remote during Covid, new hires failed often when full remote due to the lacking training infrastructure for this model - More laid-back environment, but came at a cost of nothing really getting done towards the end. After Acquisition Pro's ================== - We're now fully in office (also has some CONs in of itself), making the new hire experience significantly better, and reduced the time to train from (fully remote) 12-16 months to 6-12 months due to real time collaboration. - Getting headcount that we desperately needed in many orgs (see cons) - Good restructure that makes sense on paper - Reduced linear reporting, no longer have Sr Managers reporting to Sr Managers reporting to Sr Managers. Now it's more linear and easy to follow - Payscale increases to be at or above industry standard, significantly reducing churn comparatively - Promotion opportunities more easily accessible - Complete redesign of our internal Standard Operating Procedures, making things make sense again. - Company hands out Private Equity Shares to those who contribute to getting things back on track - When you need to work from home, you can. There is a system in place that allows you to work from home with your direct Managers approval. - Unlimited PTO if given 2 weeks in advance. Sick Days are still metered, but PTO for trips and such are not. - Still has great insurance and benefits as we did prior to the Acqusition, though I do miss the EPO plan which was removed.","Most of the information needing to read will be in this section. Having read through almost all of the reviews since the acqusition, many of these reviewers tend to look at the past with rose tinted glasses. I'm sure the experience between these individuals is drastically different than my own or even each other, but it's important to remember that our stock price didn't fall to $90/share because of what our new leadership did. The old leadership did a number on the Citrix organization that will take years to recover from, and the anger rightly deserves to rest with them. Not to say the new leadership is absolved from bad policy, but a majority of these policies are being created to fix what the former leadership did incorrectly. CONS: Prior to Acquisition: Prior to and up to Henshall and his subordinates ========================================================== - After Mark Templeton, Leadership cared more about the shareholders than you, and it was obvious. This got worse year over year. - Teams were completely gutted or skeleton crewed to make the numbers look better. - Hiring cycles were a disaster. You'd be given 30 days to fill x-number of req's, which included the time of advertising, interviewing, making a decision, etc. This forced teams to hire the ""good enough"" instead of the right talent. If you couldn't make a decision by your 30th day, then the req was frozen, pulled and who knows when it'd be released again. This caused us to not be able to staff people who left, let alone get the right headcount for the staff we needed. - Poor business decisions resulting in a very bi-polar stock price. I.E Temporary licenses during covid were an outright failure. Poor purchases that left us hundreds of millions of dollars in debt for an item that didn't improve our portfolio or weren't used at all. - Hyper investments into poor performing products that only proved the 'sunk cost fallacy' instead of investing where most of the money originated from. - High turnover of CEO's and C-suite employees. - High turnover in Support, Sales, Consulting, Technical Account Managers - Inability to retain top talent due to being underpaid by industry standard - Extremely prevalent 'Yes Man' culture once you get to Director or above (not in all cases, but many). CONS: New Leadership under Tom Krause ================================ - Mandatory RTO: those of us who did perform 100-150% when remote, were gaslit in the first GEM and made to believe that we were underperforming as a whole. Those of us who realized the benefits of working fully remote: less cost commuting, more time with family, a WAY better work-life balance are now all gone. However, the statstics that you can pull yourself using our own internal CRM system can prove that this was a minority of people. Many individuals were performing suboptimally, or barely hitting their KPI's. They were unresponsive, and some were blatantly caught working two jobs at the same time during the same hours (not moonlighting). This is first-hand experience, not me parrotting what someone else has said. - Engineering teams being treated as Support, makes it very hard to retain new talent in the Engineering spaces. They got hired to code, but are being used for Support purposes. - Sales have changed to prioritize the largest and above-the-line customers - Training content is also subpar for what we need. - Fatigued work-force (remnant from the old workforce, but makes people fatigued when the new processes from the new leadership come down the pipe). - New system software being used instead of the legacy software: Outlook replaced with Gmail, Teams replaced with Zoom. These are cost saving endeavors to avoid further layoffs, but these softwares are not enterprise ready and it makes your day to day harder to manage and organize. GMAIL is absolutely the worst offender of this due to how difficult it is to produce filters that make much sense."

New CEO is Tom Krause.,"- There doesn't seem to be an authentic caring about employees. - They are joining Citrix with TIBCO, yet no plan of how the 2 teams will work together technically. - Preference is given to TIBCO and their ""way"" even though they are half the size and were continually under-performing. - Making us use new software just to save a few dollars (i.e. Microsoft in favor of Google). It's embarrassing to use GMAIL as an Enterprise company. - They are following the Broadcom playbook as the CEO came from there. DO NOT work at Citrix (aka Cloud Software Group). - Feels like they are trying to sell things off and make Citrix just a niche corporation.

Tripadvisor employees are some of the most genuine, kind, and supportive group of individuals. Sr. leadership is very down-to-earth, and feedback and ideas are expected and encouraged from every level of the organization. I have to give a special shout out to people ops and talent acquisition who are an incredibly hard working and compassionate team-driven group. Benefits! The reviews don't lie folks. The benefits really are unmatchable, even compared to other large organizations. Flexibility, even within hybrid roles. This is especially true for working parents. For anyone with even a slight interest in travel, it's a FUN, ever-evolving industry.

Tripadvisor,1,45301,A Regrettable Experience at Tripadvisor,Sales,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,Lifestyle benefit is a nice perk as well as the company shut down week between Christmas and New Years.,"I joined Tripadvisor with high hopes and enthusiasm, believing it would be a stepping stone for my career growth. However, my time at the company turned out to be the biggest regret of my professional life.

The company's primary focus appears to be solely on revenue, with little regard for the well-being of its employees or the satisfaction of its customers. The lack of value placed on both internal and external stakeholders is evident in every aspect of the organization.

One of the most glaring issues is the disorganized structure of the company. The communication and updates are shockingly poor, leaving employees in the dark about crucial information. Teams seem to lack passion for the business, resulting in a noticeable lack of desire to excel in their daily tasks.

The leadership team, unfortunately, is both inexperienced and unorganized. Their approach is not only tone-deaf but also sloppy, leaving employees feeling unsupported and undervalued. A striking example of this is the insistence on full-time office attendance while leaders enjoy vacations in exotic locations such as the Bahamas, joining meetings remotely. This stark contrast in expectations and actions highlights the lack of empathy and understanding within the leadership team.

Communication breakdowns are rampant, with emails frequently ignored, and political games playing a significant role in day-to-day operations. This creates an unhealthy work environment, contributing to the overall dissatisfaction among employees.

The benefits package provided by Tripadvisor is severely lacking, causing numerous headaches and troubleshooting efforts. There is a palpable lack of trust in how commissions are calculated and paid out, further eroding confidence in the company's transparency and fairness. In addition their were hidden cliffs with in 401k and RSU options. The limited support given to teams and customers alike underscores the company's lack of commitment to their well-being.

In conclusion, my experience at Tripadvisor has been nothing short of disappointing. This move, which I had initially looked forward to the most in my career, turned out to be a profound letdown. I strongly caution anyone considering employment with or engaging in business with Tripadvisor to think twice. The company's prioritization of revenue over its people and customers, combined with its organizational and leadership issues, make it an undesirable place to work or collaborate with."

There seemed to be a misalignment in priorities between focus areas and leadership often causing for excessive pivoting or work once deemed critical to be shelved. Once they tighten up the vision and take an unwavering approach to product development the sky is the limit."

Netflix,3,43363,How much does a functioning human cost?,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,"- Paycheck
- So many good people
- Such a great service
- Hope","I have been working for a year at Netflix.

I've seen what was supposed to be very mature people, sharing absolutely almost no contact that anyone would qualify as ""human"".
Sure, that sounds hyperbolic, let me develop (and maybe cherry-pick a little).

Have you heard about our culture? The one about giving candid feedback? - I have seen people complaining of behavior they literally demonstrated themselves in the following days.
But I have also seen these feedbacks resulting in tears both in the eyes of HR persons or fellow engineers. How human does that sound?

Have you heard about our culture? The one about not tolerating brilliant jerks? I have nonetheless seen angriness and frustration, expressed in private, public and meeting. People rejecting new ideas by default, like, any ideas they wouldn't have worked themselves on for days wouldn't count. Even if those ideas are from the best examples in the industry or academics. How many publications/contributions have you seen from Netflix to computer science in general? How does it compare against any other company of that size in the Bay Area? Can you imagine either the real insecurity (x)or the lack of innovation that could lead to this situation?

Except for a few managers, directors or VPs feeling free enough to behave at work in the same way than how they live, almost every engineer I have been interacting with, have shared as little as possible about their private life.
The rare exceptions of interpersonal exchange ends up around some sort of competitive behavior: Who is the most geeky, sportive, owns the fastest car/biggest house/visited the strangest place.

I've heard workaholic people complaining about ambitious peers who were over-managing, over-working to get even more work to do after. I feel like we're past workaholism at this point.

Maybe there are a lot of shy people! Maybe there is a culture of fear, not only of being fired, but also a fear of interacting with people going to be fired.
Maybe it's all in my head, maybe people giving 5 stars to their experience here don't care the human aspect of a company. And maybe they're right.

What about your crush, your fears, your desires for the future, your appetite for life? I've been blessed to work in enough large companies to know that the behavior that I'm seeing in Netflix is not a healthy one. I've also been lucky enough to work in other industries more socializing than tech and I can tell that Netflix has a lot to do on that side, and off-sites or team meeting won't solve that problem.

I am afraid about the tragic, but inevitable consequences of the ways people operate in this company: I guess that the day the worst will happen, it will be addressed in an impersonal memo by Reed; followed-up by 1 or 2 reminders during offsites. Possibly commented by HR in a Q&A document. And move on. This company seems as reactive in its management of people as it is proactive in its business operations.

I still work at Netflix though, not only for the paycheck, but because I hope. I hope it will change. The needed change can't happen from a candid feedback, a Q&A, or  only from inside.
Change has to come from everyone, including people who take time to read comments like this one. Netflix has so many good people and offers such a great service.

As a curious Netflix employee reading this review: think about your past, isn't there a big human thing that you would love to feel again in your current company that you've felt in the past?

As a candidate: think about what would be a good question to ask to that HR partner once your package is almost here to be offered to you, think about that comment you make at the end of an interview when you're being asked by an engineer: ""Do you have any question for me?""
What Netflix needs is an inception, something that anyone and everyone would think about after leaving the call or the room they were sharing with you.
Ask yourself, and then the others, the question you should ask if you think you want to spend a good amount of your life and energy in the place you're applying for.

- Will I learn and contribute to the knowledge of other's? Even outside the company?
- Will I see emotional responses from my peers? Will that be for other reasons than being fired or bluntly criticized?
- Will I find a friendly environment that will nurture my appetite for life?
- What is the amount of emotional interaction (celebrating, sharing, playing) to expect from a company whose service is the best to ""entertain""?
- Do androids dream of electric sheep?"
Netflix,1,45308,Incredibly Toxic Envrionment,HR-Ops,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"Salary and pay is good, competitive wages","There's no accountability and management is incredibly toxic. Competent employees and leaders are pushed out and others that are simply proficient at schmoozing execs are the golden standard. ICs are treated like machines - there's no work-life balance and managers that create a pervasive environment of fear are promoted. Processes and systems are a MESS because mid-managers overpromise without having any knowledge of the scope of work that needs to be delivered. ICs are forced to reconcile the gaps that management creates and are punished for trying to set realistic expectations. 

My manager specifically would say that this is a ""safe space"" and that she would be ""supportive and provide guidance when needed"" during team calls. Then, in my 1:1s, tell me that it was my responsibility to find the answers to my own questions when I had any. She would also spend most 1:1s belittling and berating me. In team calls, she would also single me out just to flip around immediately and say ""I'm not trying to single you out, BUT""

Overall, this team and her management has deflated me. If you value your mental and overall health, I would stay away. Some managers are great, however, the vast majority are similar to my own personal experience. The pay is simply not worth it."

Netflix,1,45135,Toxic work culture perpetuated by terrible leaders,Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Los Gatos, CA",Surrounded by incredibly talented engineers and brilliant ideas. Outstanding pay and benefits,"In a nutshell, your Netflix experience boils down to your direct manager. Managers are almighty dictators reinforcing a pervasive culture of fear at Netflix. I was originally hired by a different leader with whom I had the opportunity to connect and vet. But everything changed when I joined, my manager was someone I hadn't had a single conversation with during the hiring process. If your manager is an empathetic leader invested in your experience and growth, then read no further. But if your manager is anything like mine - a recently promoted IC with absolutely no training/experience in leadership, expect to be overly micromanaged. Expect to be humiliated and treated disrespectfully in the name of candidness over kindness. In a one-on-one conversation, my manager snapped at me when I was about to speak (I wasn't interrupting) and asked me to repeat what they just said. Expect to not have any communication for weeks on end and receive feedback out of the blue that takes you by complete surprise. Expect to have the culture memo weaponized against you. Expect to not have any allies - any attempts to move to a different team that could be a better fit will be thwarted by internal politics. Seeking help from HRBP is as futile as denying climate change. At this point my only hope is a major re-org, but I wouldn't wish this manager on anybody. Having worked in the industry for over a decade at different sized companies, I've had all kinds of managers. This is the first time I feel psychologically unsafe."

I was at Netflix new many growth phases and this one is definitely the hardest - there are a ton of talent people in the marketing department that have been there a long time (e.g. more than 4 years) but not a lot of upward mobility so it feels like folks are getting restless. It has also become a much more political environment where it feels like leadership is most focused on decision making based on perception vs. what is best for the work and the teams.

Netflix,4,44885,"Still a great company, but losing it's magic",Product Designer,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,"Netflix is unlike any other company I've worked at. There's a level of trust that you don't see at other companies, and the people you work with all tend to be senior-level and very capable. Because of that, there hasn't been a hierarchy among IC's; everyone leads projects and functions as a trusting peer with everyone else. It's also always been a pretty lean company with process where it's needed but not the influence of politics and bureaucracy. But both of those are slowly changing, and I fear it will soon become like every other tech company. Another pro is that the compensation is 100% salary (no bonuses or forced RSU's), and thankfully that's not changing.","Inconsistency in management across the company, the addition of levels among ICs could hinder collaboration as not everyone will be equals and a hierarchy will be created, the possible introduction of a location-based salary adjustment is unjustified (output stays the same, the company saves money with so many working remotely). Internal communication has been horrible lately, which is sad and frustrating for a company that prides itself on being open and transparent."

Their selling methodology es selling by selling, no focus on having the right clients with the products they need, is more like getting every client they can, by selling everything they can, without considering if the client is actually ready or needs what its being sold. 

In terms of employees, the expectations are unfair an unrealistic, disorganized changes leave clients unattended and representatives with heroic situations to save some accounts, with poorly guided and unfair blame by leadership. I encountered situation where clients did not know of products they had on their accounts, lack of contact for over a year, or requests left unattended for months.

Exposure to different part of business and learn from both success and failure stories. 4. You have the luxury to work from home and if there is an office close to your location, you can have your own flexible hybrid schedule.","1. The company has gone private which means less transparency than before. 2. Teams and workflow processes are unstructured with teams acting as separate entities using their own softwares, logos, etc.--to the detriment of cross-functional congruity. 3. Focus is more reactive than proactive, trading problem-solving and foresight for band-aid decisions, which exacerbates a vicious cycle of constant refocus on previous problems causing a “pile up” with new ones. 4. You are not set up for success. Managers incapable of providing tools and resources will chide and scold you for errors stronger management would’ve mitigated. There is also a “wild, wild, west” mentality where juniors are “on their own” until they mess up (and then, of course, it’s all their fault for doing so) and toxic competition among team members (employees trying to prove that they are “valuable” to the business by keeping work to themselves, belittling coworkers on Zoom calls, questioning others abilities behind their back, etc.). 5. Each senior/direct manager or leadership team has their own agenda, leaving you no choice but to follow suit. You’ll become “backdoor” managers of people because existing managers lack the competence to do so and the work will fall to you. On top of a ridiculous amount of managing up already required. 6. Some managers propagate a “yes man/woman” culture even when confronted with lack of resources to complete requests. This exacerbates an already daunting corporate culture towards elevating certain employees’ feelings over productivity, sensible project management, and/or actual employee support and engagement. 7. Teams can be extremely lean: employees hired for one job end up doing 2."

This isn't a software company. It's an M&A company with call center style salesteam. Acquire & license small companies that are doing something niche in the marketing world. Try and eventually fit it into a really massive, fragmented product offering. Get your sales army to outright harass anyone and everyone that might have had a job title somewhat related to marketing/PR/Comms within the last 15 years. Overcharge them, and make it really inconvenient for them to cancel 

Internal CRM is an absolute joke and makes things insanely complicated and difficult just to do your job.
Then they stack sales enablement tools on top, that don't sync with the CRM, which causes all sorts of issues. Then add like 15 google sheets into the mix. Just so unnecessarily complicated.

Account ownership rules are pathetic/non existent, you'll end up calling mostly sole proprietors - trying to sell them 20k worth of software they 100% don't need or want, can't afford, and likely won't buy..even when you ""discount"" it 85% at the end of the month

You essentially can bypass the several years you would need to have as an SDR/BDR at most other sales company, which is a huge plus.
-Company culture for the most part is great, especially once Covid hit. A lot of middle management and senior leadership took a step back from what had been historically the norm (strict regimented daily schedules such as ""Cold Calling Power Hour"" time blocks throughout the day, pressure to be in the office, etc) and now give significantly more leniency with how people work, especially now that most are fully remote. Leadership leading teams with more of an empathy-first mentality.
-Really great opportunity to climb the career ladder quickly, with promotions usually given every year pending sales performance and your team/culture contribution. Most start in as an entry-level individual contributor, and can be promoted into management or senior individual contributor by the next year.
-Product is sick and sells itself. Definitely clear cut leaders in the space with so many exciting innovations on the roadmap.
-Company provides a 50% 401k match, with other benefits such as ClassPass subsidized, Calm App, health/dental/vision insurance
-Work with amazing, talented people. Great networking opportunity
-Uncapped commission and great bonuses... have the opportunity to make a lot of money if you perform","Honestly only one major con, which is the pay. Like any company, Meltwater isn't perfect, so in addition to pay, below are a few things I think could be improved:

-Pay... we aren't competitive enough to recruit or retain the talent we need to continue our growth trajectory. Perhaps back in the day we could recruit new hires straight out of college, train them to be cold-calling machines and crank out one-and-done deals on the daily... and while we compensated our average/low pay by offering amazing office culture and fun monthly office events, this just doesn't cut it any more. Now that we're all remote and sky-rocketing inflation has affected many including significant increase in cost of living, we can't pay our bills with company culture. This needs to be addressed immediately.
-Since we've been WFH, it would be nice if the company offered to subsidize our WiFi or phone bills. Many tech companies began offering this as a new benefit when Covid hit.
-I think the company would benefit from hiring externally for certain leadership positions. Many mid-level and senior management are internal hires who started entry-level and were promoted from within. While this is great if you're trying to scale and grow rapidly, Meltwater is now an established 20 yr old company, and we need diversified leadership experience from individuals who have various track records (working at different SaaS companies) of successfully running large Client Success or Client Acquisitions teams in order for us to level up. I think Meltwater is too close minded in that the majority (~98%) of our senior sales leadership were internal promotions and Meltwater is the only tech sales company they've every known..."

This entails leadership changes and new visions all the time. The new foreign bosses talk about how great it's going to be, all the profits they could make, yada yada. In a year or two, Cogent is being sold to another company, rinse and repeat.
This office has some of the craziest office bureaucracy among senior managers that I've seen. The problem with a small office are the things they can get away with. They power trip in e-mails and say things in private to employees, that are fireable offenses. Who can you inform, when HR answers to them. Several teams collectively brought up the abuse with our HR and even went up the chain, and nothing ever gets done. 
There's not much invested in employees, job satisfaction, or job growth. Those who are in middle management have been there for decades, and stroke the executive's egos full time to keep their jobs. 
The projects here are interesting at first, but you will be grinding out the same type of work day in and out. R&D needs a huge overhaul for the company's future. 
The pay here is average. There is not much incentive to stay here, but depending on the team you will be worked to the bone.

Mistrust - Management and HR would say one thing then do another. 
HR told us that being an 'exempt' employee means that we would be working at least 40 hours weekly and therefor required to stay extra and work weekends; United States law defines an exempt employee much differently. 
HR promised to cover certain payments in job acceptance, then attempted to deny these expenses after hired, 
Management promised to hire more employees (after being given many resumes and resources) for nearly a year, then moved tasks to a foreign location and hired employees... found out it was planned the entire time.

I worked here for far too long. There is only one good remaining division that every manager and employee is fighting to get in to, and a few gems. The rest are falling apart with cronyism and bad decision making. All the good engineers have left or are making moves to leave. 

Hiring, even on the engineering side, is usually done last minute to fill a slot before some expiration date, leaving teams filled with sandbags. Software architecture stack is archaic. We once had national geographic ask to record us.

If you are desperate and need to buy time till a better deal comes about, sign up, but make sure to continue building on the side to avoid atrophy.

If it's not your first job, but you have experience, you will definitely be expected to hit the ground running. I consider these both pros because if your experience is valued, or you have energy to burn, you will be put to use. You basically have two years to prove yourself. First year is to find your right fit and for management to assess your energy level. Second year is to see if you have adjusted to your new 'stretch goal'.

I have been fortunate to have excellent managers whom I could trust professionally and who have challenged me along the way. Many are not so fortunate, however. My direct managers are why I am still here.

Regardless of the situation, we always get the job done.","If you are looking for a dot.com rocket ride or most everything that the tech journals/press laud about ""high tech"" companies, keep looking. Things are fast-paced because everything is understaffed. Always. Managers are selected early in their careers, groomed and promoted. That's not to say that this doesn't work well-enough in general, however, if you're 7-8 years in and not yet a manager, you won't be. HR ""career advancement"" is a joke. I've never seen anyone, other than management, switch verticals (e.g. from telecom to M-2-M, or any other vertical) successfully. Promotion is usually up or out.

If your manager is in France (most are, once you reach a certain level) you will be competing against the locals over there for resources and time/energy/interest from your manager. It's only natural, but it's terrible professionally. Your manager, and his/her (most are men) respect level from their manager have a tremendous impact on your ability to make an impact for the company.

Gemalto,2,43144,Awful Management and Understaffed,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"Gemalto has quite many great employees that work tirelessly to yield great results with the little that they have. They put in long hours, attend early morning pointless meetings, and work late in to the night “until we get more people.” Management doesn’t often recognize the efforts of those that are not in the upper echelon, but you will find peers that will look out for your wellbeing. This is actually the strongest point of this company. The employees really band together and try to make the best with what they have. You will make friends easily and look forward to seeing them each day.
If you have a fondness for travel or working with people from all over the world, you will feel just at home in Gemalto. You will likely need to coordinate with multiple international teams, and have meetings with your manager, who will be located in France. If you are lucky or are in a more sales role, you will get to enjoy more international travel.
Since Gemalto doesn’t compete very well in the USA market, internal recruitment is pretty good. You can jump up diagonally or horizontally quite easily. This is great for gaining experience in a field that you thought would have been locked away professionally behind several years of experience in a different company. 

Health care and dental are really good. Wish I had given birth or broken a bone while I was on their plan.","The upper most management and HR are not dependable or trustable. Great HR people will eventually leave the company, leaving behind a slew of yes-men. You will have some one promoted over you quite quickly because they are friends with the right person. The company wasn’t like this long ago, but that’s the turn that it took in late 2016, going in to 2017.
You will find some good managers on the low levels, but it is rare. What you will encounter is a management culture that is much more focused on their personal gain than your place in the company. You will find managers that block your opportunities to move around to other teams or are unwilling to give you the raise that you deserve. It is unfortunate that this company refuses to try and retain their talent.
You will never get enough people on your team. Since this company keeps losing good talent, you will always be doing the job of 2 employees or more. Even when they hire more talent, it is only a matter of time till your next team member leaves.

I enjoy going to work every day and like everyone in the office. There are a lot of very nice people working here.

The flexibility is great. If i have an errand to run, I can leave the office if work permits and go do it. No problem! 

401K matching and (sometimes) stock purchase benefits are available.","If you speak French, you have it made at Gemalto. If you are American, you will be lucky if you ever get in management. There are a few VP level American managers at our office, most are French. However, they are men. If you are a lady, your chances of getting into management are in the ""miracle"" category. 

Along these lines, at Gemalto you are probably working for a French person. Many times this person is actually in France. This is problematic, because your French manager will provide resources and time to the people he sees in front of him... in France. You are in the US, so you will often draw the short straw. Objectives are written in broken English, so may be difficult to understand. Phone calls and emails from your manager may be equally as cryptic. 

It is very difficult to get a raise at Gemalto. Definitely negotiate what you want at the get go. There will be low and few increases after you join.

Hard work is not rewarded. You are always told that you were ""expected"" to do the things you do, even if you work insanely hard on things that are not in your objectives. This goes back to above, low raises. Perhaps they don't want to give you credit for your work, or else they may have to give you a raise. 

If you need a pat on the back for your good work, this is not the place for you. You will probably only get feedback if there is an issue that needs modification.

It is hit and miss as far as management goes. You could be lucky and get a good manager, but most of the managers are promoted for being great developers, and are not the best managers. 

There is a lot of politics going on. It is not conducive to good teamwork. It is kind of an every man for himself type atmosphere. Your manager's top priority is looking good. If you are one of those people who likes to come to the office and work and go home, get ready to learn about politics!"

Boxing: you are put in a ""box"" in the sense that you are expected to work on the same domain for years on end. Unwillingness to allow development teams to have ownership of their product domain, thus leading to employees feeling dis-empowered, demotivated, lacking passion for their work, and rampant (justified) cynicism towards management initiatives. This is a 9-to-5 environment where nobody really cares much about what they do, they just do it because it pays the bills. Zero innovation unless you work at the Gemenos, France office because every new idea must be vetted by Corporate managers, and when good ideas are presented they are often taken and repackaged by Corporate R&D, leaving engineers at satellite offices with no recognition. Extremely difficult to move within the company if you're not a ""yes man"" who never questions the status quo. Very high employee turnaround due to the reasons above and intense internal politics and bureaucracy. You may thrive in this environment if you are a social butterfly who's good at navigating the bureaucracy and play your cards right. But then you're probably not a great engineer. And the problem is that the top is full of the aggressive corporate ladder climbers who got there by stepping on their peers, and those people will be your managers. Expect unreasonable deadlines, nonsensical requirements, superfluous projects designed to pad some project manager's resume, time consuming tracking of developer time down to the hour (yes, even full-time salaried software engineers must produce detailed reports of how they spent their time), among other nonsense.

Being a French company, everything of French origin gets precedence: French nationals enjoy very generous expatriate contracts to work overseas, a disproportionate amount of internal third-party software solutions are of French origin despite the fact that they are often considerable inferior and more expensive than leading providers. 

One last thing that really bother me is the extensive use of open source software internally without any kind of contribution back to the FLOSS community. When Gemalto can't find a French company to provide some service, they will grab an open source solution, customize it, and deploy it internally world-wide. All while not allowing employees to make any contributions to those projects as a matter of company policy (some exceptions exist, mostly employees who have developed solutions in their own personal time)."

They also strongly encourage internal transfer and promotion, which means there's a real career ladder at Gemalto. Excellent benefits, including generous PTO, decent health care plans, and exceptional life insurance.","Gemalto spends less than half the industry average on marketing, making it challenging to get in front of customers.

Compensation and Benefits: The compensation is OK. Nothing special for market rates. Benefits, though, are good. For everyone I've worked for thus far, Gemalto's healthcare and 401k are unbeatable.","Management by Objectives: Every company says this. They never do. It's a way to satisfy upper management who are disconnected with what the workers accomplish.

Recruitment: Gemalto has a joke of a recruitment policy. For starters, unless you have a Bachelor's degree or higher? Don't even bother talking to them. It is an absolute requirement, and a silly one. I've interviewed people who have the perfect skill sets that we need, and because of that one little piece of paper, they aren't even considered.

Promotion from Within: To management only. And it's all poltical rather than based on merit. People who have worked in the same position for multiple years without raises or promotions, despite being exceptional members of a team.

Training: A joke. There is no training. Even if you jump up and down screaming at senior management, showing all of the flaws of your job because of the lack of training, not a thing will be done about it.

Mobility: Yes, if you like working in other countries. If you are looking to work in the town you live in, where your home and family are, you will get nowhere. If you are willing to change countries of citizenship every 2 years there are plenty of opportunities."

Gemalto,1,42939,"""Tech"" Company that outsources IT",Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Belcamp, MD",Ample opportunity to travel the world and learn new skills.  Large company so the possibility of being acquired is low.,"Not really a tech company.  Their products are all acquisitions.  The company then turns around, trains someone making much less money and lays off the engineers and support staff responsible for creating the product.  The result is techs and support staff who aren't too knowledgeable in the product they support.  Not only is this frustrating to the support engineers but think of how the clients must feel!

The IT staff for the most part is 90% outsourced.  Unqualified and overpaid it's easy to say if you have the slightest problem with your computer you might as well just reinstall your operating system before it actually gets fixed.  The remaining 10% are incompetent.   No one has an original idea or wants to make the company or processes better. People are content just to come into work and collect a paycheck.

The company is French based, so get used to being wrong all the time.  As stated earlier there are no original ideas just acquired companies that knew what they were doing.

You get the ability to learn new skills, but it's often at the cost of the company performance and the hatred from your peers.  You have 10 years of experience in software development?  Let's put you in a manager role of HR.  You are a senior Finance member?  We have the perfect position for you in R&D.  If you happen to get promoted from a senior member to a management role you get the additional privilege of learning out how much more your pervious peers make more then you.  Yes, make.  HR won't do a thing, as far as they are concerned this is what you agreed on so who cares if the people under you make more.  You should feel privileged to be promoted."
Gemalto,1,43151,"Not a place for growth- Too many leeches who linger- Company does not care for you, but Metrics",Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Pasadena, CA","The only Pro in this place, was that this business is in Biometric needs and Technology, and that is the future. I am speaking in general with reference to the entire division, I worked closely to many departments during my time there- although working there, I did meet a few capable and intelligent folks along the way, although they too tend to stay a very short time, go figure.","This review is specific to Gemalto Cogent and let me start by saying, this company has so much potential for real extraordinary growth, however with current management, leaders, and even supervisors this place will not succeed. Not to mention HR, this is by far the worst HR, I have ever encountered, like other post before mine, this company DOES not invest in you as a person nor in your professional growth, and they say they do, but actions do not relay such statements. 

I have been with the company for about 2+ years, and although Gemalto recently took over, they have kept most, if not all the same staff from past company 3M Cogent along with that companies fad and mentality (old habits).

This company does keep people for many years like 16+ years, and mind you, I have no idea why? Many past meetings have been useless, unproductive, and sometimes with the same agenda on a weekly basis- causing counter production and unnecessary waste of useful time. My past post, kept me busy, I had a lot of work, I was overworked and in an understaffed department. For some reason (Management) a few departments had a high turn around, this was due to unprofessional, rude, and unbearable Managers, to the point where they will scream to staff in front of everyone, and for the most part it was for small matters that could have been addressed without an encounter. HR is best friends with the Managers that have been unprofessional, so there are some sacred cows there. Also, specifically my department had a high turn around, not only in staff but management, in my time there, I had many managers- who I had to train all to simply change policy due to “I know it best mentality”, this places only constant was change, and although change is good, it is not good when they keep hiring unqualified and inexperienced managers.

I have so much to say,  my statement is not to deter you from applying but simply and honest response to the factual experience I had with this company. But, honestly if you need the gig, then go for it, only do not expect it to be a good fit, and always have a contingency plan ahead, and obviously be prepared, you never know, maybe a new company will take it over and have all new management. These companies tend to change constantly, they are in it for the money, not the business and therefor not its people.

At some point I meet with some hierarchies, and had some real hopes for this place, and although things wont change in a matter of months, but thus far the changes that did take place, only made the matters worse."

Sat in a broken chair for years because they refused to accommodate any needs beyond keeping the power on. - Bathrooms leaked constantly. Building smelled of Fecal Matter at all times. - Holiday ""Parties"" were often cobbled together employee events. Company would set aside next to nothing for most events. Had one event we heavily budgeted where any sort of benefit was provided. - Forced to utilize broken, outdated, and honestly painful equipment.

Marvell Technology,2,45084,Started great but quickly turned toxic,Program Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Santa Clara, CA",Very positive in the first 3 months. Lots of enthusiasm in the initial hiring and on-boarding phase. But that wore off quickly.,The real Marvell is being asked to work long hours and weekends (60 hour work weeks will become standard). That is unless you are friends with or connected/related to someone in upper management. Directors and VPs vying for power and leveraging people against each other. There is a tolerance for and promotion of toxicity and overall very negative politics. And a general disorganized approach to work. No real plan for employee culture outside of copying values & initiative of other semiconductor companies & what is trending for culture ideas and engagement.

Very strategic acquisition in the past few years to position company as a strong provider for 5G, networking infrastructure company.

Company is forward-thinking by embracing working from home and hybrid working model. This is I think the best way forward for productivity and also work life balance. There are many times where I'm very productive when working from home as distractions are minimal or non-existence.

Singapore office is very well designed to facilitate and accommodate hybrid working model. Money well spent!","With many recent company acquisitions, there are a lot of fragments that have to be integrated in the coming years.

Higher level management (sr. VP and above) seems disconnected from lower level workers and are looking out for their own interest
Not enough company wide events, and when they do happen, seem cheap and badly put together
There are some SERIOUSLY underwhelming people working here on all teams, whom I have no idea how they got hired in the first place.

Internal processes are slow, inefficient, and error prone, and therefore expensive. Things that can and should be automated are being done manually, requiring much more work than necessary. They won't replace people in my department when they leave, so we are now doing 2x the work with 1/2 the number of people.

Although the schedule is flexible, I often have to be available for meetings early in the morning or late at night because the development team is in India and China.

Layoffs are frequent and with no communication. It's frustrating to be working on a project with someone, have them not show up to a meeting, only to find out that they have been laid off. This has happened more than once!

The performance review process is a joke. Self assessments have no bearing on grade, and bonuses/raises are not given fairly. Profit sharing used to include everyone in the company, but now only goes to some employees based on review grade.

Work + work + work + work = burnout."
Xilinx,1,39930,The greed and averous of the executive management is disgusting!!!,Senior Staff Engineer,Current Employee,"Longmont, CO",Xilinx still has many exceptionally talented people working here (for now).  The work ethic and integrity of most individual contributors is exceptional despite the ridiculous burden of work placed upon them due to layoffs.,"The apparent greed and averous of the executive management is disgusting.  They have shown monumental short sightedness in most of their recent business decisions.  They have been completely reactionary to the competition and have been outmaneuvered at every point since taking over in '08.  Xilinx presently has over 30 VPs or higher and more than 180 Directors or higher showing that the ratio of Senior Management to individual contributors is skewed to a nonsensical extreme.

Xilinx is acting like a start up in asking/pushing employees to put in very long hours to make up for the reduction in staff after two sizable layoffs.  This might be reasonable if employees believed management had some intelligent plan for the future but no such plan has been communicated.  There is little prospect of reward for the extra effort being demanded.

When the economy improves I predict a mass exodus from Xilinx US, and Europe.  This is probably what Moshe is wanting so he can move more jobs to India and Singapore."
Xilinx,2,40005,"Oh, how the mighty have fallen...",Engineer,Current Employee,"San Jose, CA","1) Even though Xilinx has successfully improved it's stock price (haha) by letting go many of the longer-term employees, whether they were excellent employees or not, and in important roles or not, there are still many great people who work here.  Sharp engineers, helpful peers, a willingness to see the company's products succeed in spite of the incompetent senior management and critically bad morale.
2) Unless you're part of the executive staff, you're not actually forced to listen to Moshe speak in person.  He seems to prefer to hide from the ""common folk"".","With maybe one or two exceptions, the new senior management team are scary-bad, with the scariest and baddest at the top.  It’s truly amazing how some people get the jobs that they do...  Compassion, morale, open communication, and anything resembling the previous corporate values have flown out the door, and the bottom line is now absolute king - which may not even sound that bad to some people, but the problem is these clowns are demonstrating they have absolutely no clue how to get there.  Somehow slashing long-time employees, and throwing away EVERYTHING that existed before they got here, isn't working.  Huh.  Go figure.  Maybe the stock will finally go up after they've outsourced all of the jobs except for their own to India and Singapore?   I'm guessing that's their next move..."
Xilinx,2,40026,Just another company,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,"Strong technology and market leadership.
Pockets of excellent chip design engineers who understand fpga technology and how to tie everything together to make a functional product.
A lot of very hard working individuals who will work 24/7 to tape out a chip.","New management team is technically strong but all come from a asic background and don't seem to understand or care to learn about the custom design nature of an fpga.  However, under the previous management team, continuous improvement was not something encouraged unless one of a few select individuals wanted it to happen.
Morale is ok (but not good) in some groups but is very low in other groups especially those that have a lot of 15+ year employees.  For the most part, they don't like what they see and don't think it will get any better.
If the job market was better, attrition would be much higher, and when the market turns, don't stand by the door because you'll get run over.  The stock used to keep employees at Xilinx, it hasn't done much in recent years and the majority of stock options are under water.
Some organization changes were long overdue, so they were not all bad, but in the end, Xilinx is just another company, nothing special."

Flexible hours are allowed in most engineering groups.  Benefits are OK, salary is OK.","Xilinx used to be a place that everyone was proud to work.  Wim was a charismatic leader, who made a lot of crucial and successful business decisions, and was a true leader that the employees believed in.  Moshe came on board, hired some really poor people to support him who really don't seem to understand the core-competence of the Xilinx's products or the importance of keeping the core knowledge of the innovative and creative engineers who were around before them.  

The bottom line is the new bottom line.  Every decision is now made for maximizing short-term profitability at the expense of what appears to be the long-term health of the company.   Excellent, talented, and very experienced engineers are constantly being let go from North America and Europe, and their jobs are being replaced in India and Singapore (usually in the name of being cost-efficient).  It seems to be working in the short term to boost margins, but the long-term fate is extremely questionable at best."

The work can be challenging and plentiful.  Employees are usually top notch.  While there was some effort effort in the past to create a homogeneous corporate culture that has dissolved but some groups (mostly in engineering) keep that flame burning and provide a supportive environment to develop technically and professionally.,"Xilinx is a company in transition.  New management arrived in January, 2008 and still seems to be working on developing a strategy for growth.  Granted the sudden recent economic events have not made that easy but management is also unusually invisible and non-communicative or opaque about the future.  Most recent pronouncements have been schizophrenic in proclaiming both that we have the most advanced technology, the best solutions, we are positioned for stellar growth and that the market is doomed and we are destined to collapse with it.  While it may be possibel to hold both of these opinions simultaneously, management has not been particularly good at explaining how that can be."

There is a vision for the company to grow, and a challenge that will likely be met by an excited team.","Sometimes collaboration has its drawbacks.   It takes too long to make decisions, and often decisions are ""reviewed"" and discussed after the fact.  The other downside right now is really that the company has had new executive management put in place so the guy on top is new, the executive staff and folks that report to him are mostly new, the org structure and teams are all changed up, and that leaves lots of unknowns.  Other downsides include IT responsiveness and a slowness to pickup enterprise 2.0 concepts."

Working remote is fairly flexible depending on your manager.",High workload with no relief offered by management although aware of the high workload. The pay is far below what you would expect for market rate. Compensation is based off of a national average instead of localizing the pay based off your reporting office location.

This creates a ‘recover/catch up/reprioritize with new replacement leader’ the support departments are cycling through 4 years now. They can’t keep up with the people that are leaving and burn out is still occurring at all levels of management & support. I am less motivated to go above & beyond when we constantly see new hires coming in at much higher rates that many of us could easily be worth more leaving for the same role elsewhere. This isn’t a new issue by any means, but it was an aging model before Covid and post-Covid it’s a downright ancient practice with much higher rates and exacerbated by the constant replacement leadership.

The company continues to experience strong growth, but there are significant challenges, particularly in the supply chain. There are certain departments and teams that offer better work environments than others. The ""unlimited PTO"" is nice, although you need to work for a manager & department that embrace taking PTO to fully take advantage of this. The Employee Stock Purchase Program (ESPP) is a nice perk to have access to. The 401K matching rate is fairly competitive.  Most teams are still very flexible with remote work, which is very convenient.  There were no required weekly days in the office when I left.","Heavy workload placed upon individuals in supply chain, tedious & manual job activities, lower than industry average pay, and a lack of gratitude for the hard work of supply chain individual contributors from certain senior leaders and members of the sales team. Supply Chain seems to operate in a constant state of chaos. Some areas of supply chain do not embrace taking PTO, which leads to high burnout levels among employees. Annual bonus growth seems to have stagnated post-Covid. Annual raises are consistently very low. It is very hard to be promoted within supply chain. However, lateral ""rotations"" are frequently offered. There is a lack of transparency, honesty, and integrity between some supply chain people leaders and their individual contributor employees."

The people leading the charge are trying to sell years old technology (to the industry) as cutting edge and our customers know it and the overall product is suffering. * Ideas from employees to make the company or product better are seen as annoyances rather than innovation. * If you work hard expect more work, but mediocrity gets you promoted as long as you have tenure. * Motorola bought this company out over a year ago and there is still a significant group of people who want to only be Envysion and actively resist the change."

I don't feel like anyone really cares about my development or me as a person, but maybe this is just my team (no one has ever really asked how i'm doing, how i feel in the role, etc.) which makes it hard to feel engaged at work. no real emphasis on career progression and development, just the day-to-day client work. unlimited PTO can feel like a scam, as people brag about not taking time off so you feel pressured to not take off and don’t have the excuse to “use up” your vacation days. the lack of senior leadership doesn't help culture and morale. can feel like a ""drink the kool aid and don't question it"" culture which makes improvement more difficult."

Maybe 10 years ago it was competitive, but other companies offer leagues beyond what SAS offers. Doesn't matter if the company had a good year or not, bonuses seem to be completely unrelated to revenue. 

Senior management casts blame at developer when process is the issue, yet they offer no solutions other than ""do better."" They dodge questions instead of admitting they don't have an answer.

SAS is swimming up a waterfall trying to stay competitive. They are far too slow to deliver software and refuse to drop parasitic customers that refuse to upgrade from legacy products. Too much time is wasted in development keeping outdated code alive and in setting priorities, because everything is ""top priority."" 

SAS used to be one of the best places to work, but the times have drastically changed. Senior management is shortsighted, idealistic, and out of touch. The company has a lot - and I mean a lot - of work to do before they can claim to be competitive in the market and as an employer."

But it only came about when the founders and owners of the company failed to agree on price when they tried to sell SAS a couple of years ago. These same leaders waxed on over the years about how valuable employees were, only to try and sell the company to another company known for gutting their acquisitions and laying people off. I’m a very long term employee and I truly used to believe SAS was the best place to work. I bragged and felt lucky to work at SAS, but those feelings are completely gone. I’m just waiting now to see what happens. I don’t hold out much hope that employees will be treated well. What a sad end to what could have been a great legacy. I’m no fool, I’ll take the money (I’ve earned it after all the years of working well over the “35 hour work week” on non-competitive pay rates), but I’ll never forget the betrayal of employees by senior management."

The company genuinely values the well-being of its employees and encourages a healthy lifestyle. Flexible hours, remote work options, and a supportive management team all contribute to an enjoyable and stress-free work environment. Wonderful Teammates: The camaraderie and support provided by my colleagues at SAS have been exceptional. Team members are friendly, helpful, and committed to working collaboratively. The positive atmosphere fostered by my coworkers has made coming to work each day a pleasure.","Below-Average Compensation: While the work-life balance is certainly a highlight, the compensation package at SAS leaves much to be desired. Salaries are not competitive with industry standards, making it difficult to feel truly valued for the work we put in. This could lead to a higher turnover rate as employees seek better-paying opportunities elsewhere. Limited Transferable Skills: Unfortunately, the nature of the work at SAS does not provide many opportunities for employees to develop transferable skills. The tasks can be repetitive, and the learning curve tends to plateau after a short time. This may hinder professional growth and make it challenging to transition into new roles or industries."

Some advertised benefits are almost impossible to get, and there is little transparency on whether you'll get them when you apply. Pay is significantly below local market, but that's obscured by the job title game. You are grouped into job titles that may not reflect the position you applied to or work you are doing. Moving up is political versus based on ability or contributions. If you get a great boss, it could be a great job, but bad managers are protected and complaints through proper channels can lead to being listed as a no rehire. Most tech companies have equivalent or better benefits. Some changes are very heavy handed and communicated horribly,  but are sometimes reversed when there significant complaints.

- My manager and I would constantly surface issues that impacted the business and customers to get a ""we hear you"" response, but ultimately no action was ever taken from the Director, VP, or executive level
- Does not matter if you work hard or not, your efforts do not make an impact because important changes are not made from the top
- Huge fiefdoms; SAS is the first place I ever worked where a department purposely sabotaged or delayed the release of an asset to protect their own resources"

SAS,3,45126,Sinking Ship,Technical Support Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Cary, NC","Great benefits, company cares for its people","Sadly, its a tenure based culture."
SAS,3,45105,Not the same,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,Smart people and powerful technology and good benefits,"SAS missed its chance to go public and lost market share to smaller, nimbler competition."
SAS,5,45096,Headline,Sr. Software Developer/Analyst,Current Employee,,Its been a good place to work,"Been constant change for a number of years now. Not sure its completely different from the industry, but it can be frustrating."
SAS,5,45113,very flexible,Merchandising,Former Employee,,"Schedule was flexible, hours what I prefered.",A little repetitious but not totalky.
SAS,3,44981,What it's like?,Inside Sales Representative,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Raleigh, NC","The daycare and service providers are fantastic and loving. You're seen as a human being and not just a number. So, you can have a balance between your life and your work. You have an amazing health care system. Campus is incredible and the gym has the best equipment.",Pay is insulting. And feedback seems to go directly to the wall.
SAS,4,44998,Overall a great company to work for,Business Operations Specialist,"Former Employee, more than 10 years","Cary, NC",Great work-life balance and health benefits. Lots of pros. Few cons.,Leaving people (warm bodies) in management positions who have no business being managers or even SAS employees. True downfalls to the success of potentially great business unit(s).
SAS,1,45036,Laid-off while on FMLA disability,Lead Enterprise Architect,Former Employee,,"As long as your manager likes and supports you, it can still be good place to work, and if you work in Cary, the amenities are great, but if you work remote then you have to be worried about your job.","Used to be a great company, but the culture was effected by the pandemic and their desire to go public so that Management no longer cares about their staff. To the point that even while on disability, I was still Laid-off."
SAS,1,45099,This place is a joke,Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","San Francisco, CA",They pay is ok with decent benefits.,Good tech but until CEO is removed from day-to-day operations the company will continue to stagnate and underperform it’s peer group of competitors and contemporaries.
SAS,2,45071,Ok but tired of woke agenda,Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,Great benefits and work/life balance,Tired of company pushing political opinions. Has become so woke. The company should focus on running the business instead of pushing its beliefs on employees.
SAS,3,45092,"Good Work Life Balance, Old Tech",Software Engineer,Former Employee,"Cary, NC","Great food and perks, little work really required per employee",There is no hustle and the work is slow
SAS,3,45098,Just OK,Sales Representative,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Dallas, TX",Get to be out in the field as opposed to behind a desk.,Not enough room for advancement.
SAS,5,45089,Great work life balance,Senior Associate Software Developer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Cary, NC","Great work life balance, ability to work remotely, good compensation and world class benefits.",Pay is good but could be better
SAS,3,45097,SAS US,Sales Manager,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Johannesburg, CA","Great Brad, well kwow as a leader",The culture gets lost as you move further from the headquartrs

SAS,2,44914,High Performers Look Elsewhere,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,Most people are supportive and kind. There is a lot of flexibility with schedules and work/life balance. I enjoy being able to work with people from all over the country and all over the world.,"The company is old and set in its ways. More senior employees get away with doing the minimum because they know they won't be fired, while the hardest workers carry the weight and go unrewarded. Young professionals do not have good growth or learning opportunities. Management seems to take it for granted that everyone would want to work at SAS and will never leave, which is increasingly not true. These days, other companies offer better salaries and perks."
SAS,4,45056,Was a great place to work,Management,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Cary, NC",Relaxed culture and great programs for employees.,Minimal company growth prospects make it hard to continue benefits
