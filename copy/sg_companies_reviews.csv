The experience for software managers and engineers is all over the board, from really run low operational load teams to teams where people burn out after a year.

 - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian.  You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived.  You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned.  There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long.
  - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue)
  - A chance to make a huge difference
  - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself
  - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions).
  - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain","- You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that.
- Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today.  It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.

I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone."
Amazon,5,23-Feb-18,An Amazing Place to Work,Software Development Manager,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Phoenix, AZ","I've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction.

The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.","No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that.

Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse."

Amazon,4,23-Mar-17,We are now in a world where we are condescended to by our inferiors,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Seattle, WA",This company gets A list performance from C list employees.  The culture is quick and hard charging.  You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.,"Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways.

Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey.  This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon.  The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people.""

The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism.  Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street."

Amazon,4,19-Sep-14,A huge diverse high tech company with all sorts of stuff,Software Development Engineer,Current Employee,"Seattle, WA","Disclaimer: My opinions reflect that of an SDE in Amazon. Seems like some operational job functions are very tough.

I have read through some of the other Amazon reviews and it seems to me that everyone has a very different experience! This is so true. Within the same team, you can have both workaholics and slackers coexisting and coworking together. I think I am more of the balanced type as I try to stay sane. The Amazon experience is basically the entire spectrum and it is what you make it out to be.

Pros in Amazon certainly excludes great benefits, but compensation is competitive. Free food means average quality free coffee, once in a while free pizza for lunch where it is a working lunch, and free beer and finger food in special events. We get a free Orca card to take any bus in the Seattle area for free. $160 per month subsidy for office parking, which is better than nothing. Downtown monthly parking goes for about $200 per month. 401K contribution is 50% of what you put in, where you can put in max 4% of your salary. Not so great. Staff cafeteria food is average and not at all cheaper than outside food, or could be even more expensive. It is hard not to complain about the cafeteria. Vacation days are ok but note that there are no sick leaves. They count as part of your 5 personal days per year. Listing the benefits of Amazon is like listing the cons and not the pros.

Work life balance seems to be ok for the most part, and seems to be individually-driven. No one will tell you that you have to come in at what time and stay till what time. I have team mates working every night and weekend, and others getting in at 10am and leaving at 5pm, all in the same team. Managers will focus on your project deliveries instead of how much time you spend working. If you work 40-hour weeks productively, you can definitely outperform someone who works 60-hour weeks but don't deliver stuff. Working less than 40 hours per week is somewhat common, but I can't say how many people are working how long. The view on work life balance is a bit skewed. All it comes down to are the managers and what they think. Projects are always never-ending but I have found that deadlines are very realistic and reasonable, without counting your nights and weekends. Getting some slack time once in a while is probably a sign of a healthy work environment. Everyone needs a break.

On-call really really sucks. Basically all it comes down to is having SDEs double-duty as support operations engineers. Note that on-call does not improve the code quality of any team in any way. The on-call experience is particularly bad because you are using services from some other team, and their code is of low quality and fails for the wrong reasons. If the managers had given more time to up the quality, there would not be so many problems. Software is usually delivered with a tough deadline with code that meets the minimum quality bar and never gets improved for the next few years. The code review process does not seem to help improve the code but it really obstructs developers from making great changes as unconventional things will not pass code review in clumsy minds. Innovation and excellence are not the name of the game in Amazon. Searching through the Amazon code base is usually not going to turn up quality code that you can actually reuse.

Integration is the name of the game in Amazon. You will need to spend a lot of time to figure out how to integrate your code with another team's services. Whether these other people are cooperative is a hit-or-miss. I have found that most people are responsive and helpful, but there are also quite a number of jerks who are out to make trouble for everybody. It is not easy to work across teams but the experience is mostly positive.

Amazon is a huge behemoth and is hiring people like there is no tomorrow. This reflects well on a good growth momentum but also is worrying that the company is not turning much profit. If the company does not make money, where is our bonus going to come from? You can see new faces around the Amazon building almost everyday! Downside is that we are taking in a lot of average to above-average engineers and being an Amazonian SDE certainly does not share the same reputation as the top names. Amazon is a huge mixed bag of some very talented people and some very dumb people. I think the world is not turning up enough SDEs and the only way is for quality to go downhill.

As an SDE, expect to spend most of your time talking, writing emails and documents, and maybe around 20-30% of your time coding. In most of the teams, you can work on interesting projects, but probably not revolutionary ones. Note that Amazon is a very down-to-earth company and the work is very down-to-earth as well. You will work on real things that people have actually requested for, and that people will start using as soon as you are done. Work is challenging but not to expect highly technically complex stuff. Most of the work has to do with solving everyday problems. To me, this seems to make sense because I have ever tried working on experimental projects before elsewhere and I did not feel it was a good use of my time.

Internal mobility is a key strength of Amazon, and I am not sure which company has done better than Amazon in this aspect. Internal moves are easy. You only need to stay in your team for a year before moving to a different team. There is no easy way to tell which team is a good team to move to because they all have their different pros and cons and people and coming and leaving all the time!

Seattle is by much rumour an easier place to live than the Bay area.

Overall Amazon is a tough but yet sane place to work. The flexibility of this company is really its core strength. You have the freedom to excel as much as you want and also to slack as much as you want. Bummer. You shouldn't be slacking!","Beware of bad managers and horrible team mates. They are not specific to Amazon but they do exist in Amazon.

I have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office. I don't know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays.

Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.

Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.

SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else.

Employee retention is horrible. I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources. Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible. This basically mean that either you are a superstar in the company before they will try to retain you, or if you are smart you should not stay in Amazon for too long."
Amazon,4,15-May-17,"Warehouse associate, full time for over two years",Tier I Warehouse Associate,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Carlisle, PA","Great starting pay and the ability to get raises very quickly. Full training in all areas are offered and if your willing to work hard and sweat everyday for 10 hours a day, 4 days a week, then this is the job for you.

Beat benefits as well once you are a hired on as a full time employee.","After 3 years of working with the company you ""cap out"" at $15.75, meaning you can no longer make any more money than that as a tier 1 associate.

They cycle you between different positions in the warehouse so you're not stuck with one that you hate forever

The fast pace of the work doesn't slow down for you -- you have to keep up; it's a bit like being on a treadmill
The culture and expectation is that as a worker, you will comply; this isn't bad in itself because receiving orders in a chain of command is good; but there is little ""freedom"" in this job; in some jobs, you're given a responsibility with some freedom in how you pursue it (like a project or something), but the nature of the work in this position is that you are pretty much bound to do what you're told

Amazon,4,30-Jan-24,"Amazon does real engineering, but it's often a pressure cooker, and you're often just a number",Senior Software Quality Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","North Reading, MA","Amazon in North Reading is a pretty good engineering environment with decent management.

There are opportunities to work on a variety of projects and interesting HW and SW.

Projects are often well funded.
Ideas are generally welcomed and often lead to new projects.

Good benefits.

Collaboration is promoted and supported.

A good place to learn.","You'll often feel like a number as Amazon, which can sometimes treat people like a body in a slot. And HR feels very impersonal and is not known to speak up for employees against management,

It's often a pressure cooker with tight deadlines and unrealistic goals.
In many offices people don't know each other and there's not much camaraderie, culture or community. (North Reading is generally better than most Amazon offices, with a lively social culture, but it's getting to be more impersonal over time.)

Employees are secretly stack-ranked against each other by management. (They usually deny this, but I've had it confirmed by several managers and it's been written up on the net extensively.) This can lead to high-achievers suddenly being put on unrealistic PIPs (Performance Improvement Plans), leading to job loss. (Very few people survive the PIP process, which looks designed to push the person out.)

Most members of SW engineering teams are required to participate in on-call duty, which often means multiple days of 24 hour support every few weeks."

Great place to learn and get your foot in the door for IT.","The workload ramped up tremendously after a while with no extra pay. The supporting of multiple buildings was introduced the past year. Two years ago, it was a great place to get promoted. Now, it's difficult to get promoted without being buddies with upper management. They promote the wrong people who display little to no expertise while others have it or the certifications to prove themselves and who want to move up. Very disorganized and clueless management who cannot agree on anything and forget conversations or messages almost immediately. No backbone from management in upholding tickets and projects SLAs. Expect to bend over for anything operation management demands like a toddler throwing a tantrum and your own bosses yelling at you to get it done even if it goes against the ticket or project policies. Lack of building knowledge past your level and not growing. Basically it becomes a dead-end job. Get in for about a year and get out FAST!

I was gaslighted when I asked to return to the role I was hired for, saying I agreed to take on this role permanently, when the original agreement was they would hire someone specifically with matching experience. This is common at Amazon from what I hear. Management only cares about their own promo and will throw anyone under the bus as needed, don’t be fooled."

Can be as social as you want as long as you get your work done. Easy to be asocial as well if you're more introverted. Take advantage of your benefits; go to school with Career Choice, get braces/invisalign or dental work done if you need it, insurance is top tier for an entry level grunt type of job so if you need medical procedures get them done while working here. Coming from retail, I love not having to deal with customers.",Hard on the body and mind. Prepare to come home emotionally tired and physically sore until you get used to working here. Peak (Nov-Dec) will have you working 50-55 hour weeks every week. Expect to see favoritism and cliques that get special treatments and hook ups.

My building recently went through a change and they ended up cleaning house on most of our bosses, L6+. 
Amazon can be a very cut throat work environment, best advice I can give is to just keep your head down, do your work, and engage your team. Need to make sure your team respects you/ likes working for you. Without the respect of your team, you will never make it.","Too many cons to share. 
There are political games that are played at all levels. Like I said earlier, keep your head down, do your work, and earn the respect of your team. 2x times as hard to build a bridge that has already been burned."
Amazon,4,6-Dec-23,Tenured Amazonian,Finance Manager,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Seattle, WA",I worked at Amazon for almost 8 years and one thing about my experience is that no two days were the same. I loved the challenge of problem solving with the Fay 1 mentality and model. The pay is great and PTO and benefits are top tier. Amazon has a ton of resources and vendor relationships so it was great to take advantage of certain perks like free movie screenings and discounted car rentals. One of the best parts of working at Amazon is the ability to rotate to different teams- which helps avoid cultural adaptations when transferring companies. Most people who work at the Company are self driven and easy to work with.,"Although the pay is extremely good you definitely pay for it with your time. My first two years I was consistently pulling 12-14 hour days on average. Which leads me to my next con- the amount of accounting work that had to be completed manually was unbelievable. Even worse, the businesses were not properly supporting backend functions with reliable systems to track all transactions. This led to way more work for the accountants in assessing completeness and accuracy and more “tech debt” we were being tasked to resolve. Lastly, although benefits are pretty good at Amazon there’s a significant flaw in the sabbatical policy which discourages some of the most tenured employees from taking much needed breaks."

Employees with accommodations can be sent home due to the fault of person responsible for programming software to recognize and execute accommodation orders, not doing so, which results in loss of pay to the employee."

Good amount of leave and vacation. 10 hr shifts so you only work 4 days. Overtime is available sometimes and is 10 hrs so you get good pay those days. Pay increases are good every 6 months until 2 year. Education benefits of $5250/year.,Stowing is very boring a lot of accuracy and rate parameters you have to meet or you will get a write up.

If you have a sense of urgency, desire to learn, and are happy to clock in more than 10k-15k steps a day, you'll do fine here.",The flex drivers program is a bust. Everyday is a challenge with the drivers and the company doesn't give you any support. Amazon warehouses also like to hire from the corporate office and they often get placed ahead of people who have years of experience and are completely lost when it comes to production. The same people will tell you how to do your job but never used a pallet jack in their life.

-The lay-offs over the last year have everyone in recruitment walking on egg shells that there will be more lay offs, do not feel like we have job security
- Pay starting out was good, but once your bonus drops off and they dont increase your base, and stock price is very low, you are not making what was promised/explained to you when you took the job.
- getting promoted up a level is the only way to get a significant pay bump and it is way harder to get promoted up a level then they make it seem like in the beginning so while you are paid well, you wont see large advancements in salary unless promoted"

- You can talk to HR directly if you have an issue! You don't even have to wait 20+ minutes on the phone: there are stations right there in the warehouse where you can talk to a representative!
- 4 10-hour days, so you get an extra day off
- Starting pay is $17.25, which is an increase from when I last worked there, and I'm seasonal","- On the flip side, 4 10-hour days is long and exhausting
- Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance is not the greatest, though Amazon offers a tax-favorable Health Savings Account (90 days for Seasonal, 30 or 60 days for full-time, but none for Reduced- (30 hours/week required) or Part-Time (4-6/week required, I don't remember)
- You walk into hiring, wait in a line (there's usually a lot of people in there), you turn in your paperwork that they send through email (with which I've never had an issue), you get your photo ID and drug test, then you set a hire date, which is 2-3 weeks out, so it's a month before you get a paycheck"

- Very rewarding work when able to do things the way you feel is correct.
- Self-guided growth opportunities and ability to do as much work as you're wanting to do.","- Inconsistencies based off of regional guidance which varies.
- Favoritism is rampant for growth in the sense that you can grow extremely quickly under a favored leader but be stunted from another. Your entire performance is based off of 2 annual performance reviews and are FILLED with recency bias. A self-written performance review can be inflated and spoken about as if it were gold.
- Internal pay raises are a joke. Externals get brought on anywhere from $5k - $15k more. 
- PXT (HR) is held to much higher standards and promotions are a lengthy process whereas operators paid more, promoted easier, and given a lot more incentives.
- HR has little growth patterns after layoffs."

The pay is decent, and promotional outlook is decent as well. They gave me a relocation package to help me move. Their ""academy"" gave me the chance to travel to Washington State and Washington D.C. as part of their leadership program before really digging down into the work. A lot of the associates I manage are also fun. I was also given several benefit programs such as medical, dental, life, and 401k. These are not free, but the prices seemed pretty reasonable and were discounted for employees with the company.","Mostly only when things get stressful, upper management tend to lean the blame on me, and there have been instances where they weren't interested to hear what I had to say about the work I'm doing. In these instances, I have often felt like I needed to walk on eggshells, because adding my voice seemed to be unwanted or taken as a challenge rather than the feedback, idea generation, or guidance seeking that it was. This is the exact opposite with my direct managers, however. We are salaried for 10 hour days, but often run over into 12+. Its also a night shift, so be ready to be awake when everyone else is sleeping and visa versa. There will also be associates who are just uninterested in working and will cause headaches or try to weaponize HR if they don't like you for any number of reasons. Its a constant struggle to keep up with the changing demands of doing the same tasks in different ways. I feel like I've had to learn three ways to do the basic functions of my job to satisfy different leadership. Overall, however, this is the best working environment I've been in so far. The toxicity has been minimal, despite my complaining, and there is a lot of support. A month or two ago, I would have said my team was the best part of the job, more-so than the pay or growth opportunities. That has changed however, with some instances that felt downright hostile both from leadership and associates. There's also a million emails a day and a constant stream of data."

IBM,4,26-Aug-14,"Advisory Engineer in STG, IBM",Advisory Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","Hopewell Junction, NY","Disclaimer: A lot of what I'm writing below of course depends on the work area and management chain.  But I found this to be fairly pervasive policies in IBM in my 9+ years with the company. 
1. IBM's policies and management are very flexible when it comes to working remotely or accommodating various life situations (sick days, doctor visits, etc.).  Management is encouraged to measure an employee by their work and impact, and not by hours spent at their office. 
2. Great colleagues!  Though unfortunately, many have been leaving due to the instability of IBM's HW development business. 
3. At least in my area, there's a high level of flexibility on which projects should I undertake based on my and my management assessment of business impact.","1. Unfortunately, IBM still uses the ""normal distribution"" rating system, where at the end of the year each employee is ranked as a top contributor (5%), above average contributor (15%), average contributor (~75%), and bottom contributor (5%).  This curve is difficult to apply in the R&D world, where you may have many members of the team working long and hard hours, and end up being ""average contributors"" at the end of the year, because there just isn't room for all to be top contributors. 

2. The above may not be so disturbing, if only IBM didn't practically cancelled all raises, performance bonuses and incentive for the non top-performers. I've had a consistent ""above average"" rating in the last 4-5 years, and my raise and performance bonus were ridiculous mere 1.5-2% of my salary.  Were I rated ""average contributor"" I would have gotten NOTHING. So you can imagine that people can go year after year without any raise to their salary.

From talking to manager friend, this is IBM's way to eliminate the non-top-performers without having to fire them, as part of its direction of reducing US manpower. 

3. Hiring freeze in many areas - again, as part of IBM's attempt to reduce its workforce across North America and Europe we see many jobs move to the India and Far East markets.  This is of course upsetting to see local teams shrink and disappear, especially when many great local IBM colleagues and experts begin to drop out. From my experience thus far working with India SW teams - they are still very far away from the standards I would have expected from US and Europe based teams. 

4. Poor top down communication about company's and divisions' future.  Employees learn from rumors and news websites what's about to come..."

IBM invests a lot in learning platforms and actively leads important initiatives within the DEI space both internal and external. Ways of working are agile, fast paced, and you learn a lot from colleagues/peers. The environment is very open and collaborative (depending on team/BU). IBM is moving the needle on a lot of new tech initiatives that are impactful for the world, which feels great to be part of that movement.","Top leaders make all the decisions that impact those actually doing the work without ever asking or involving bottom line. At IBM your put on multiple work streams without a clear answer to ""Why are we doing this, what are we solving for, is this really worth our effort"". IBM constantly iterates and renews processes/procedures, without ensuring foundation is solid. Constant innovation and iteration is good but you need to give something enough time to actually see if it works vs constantly changing. There is A LOT of nepotism and because of this only certain people are promoted while others are forgotten about and not taken seriously. Internal mobility is also hard to come by, unless someone leaves a role, or you're a manager 'favourite' you are not getting promoted."

Some employees may feel overwhelmed by the workload and pressure.

Limited Work-Life Balance: In certain roles or during demanding projects, employees might find it challenging to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Long working hours and tight deadlines may contribute to this issue.

Bureaucracy: Large organizations often have established bureaucratic processes, which could lead to delays in decision-making and project execution. Navigating through these processes might be cumbersome for some employees.

Limited Managerial Support: Your experience of feeling overworked without sufficient support from management is a common concern in various workplaces. In a large company, communication channels can sometimes be complex, and individual experiences may differ based on teams and managers.

Emphasis on Metrics: Some employees may feel that the company places a strong emphasis on metrics and performance indicators, which could potentially impact the work environment and stress levels.

Limited Flexibility: Depending on the role and team, some employees might find that the company has a more structured and less flexible approach to work arrangements.

Communication Challenges: In a large organization, communication can sometimes be a challenge. Important information might not always be effectively communicated across teams, leading to misunderstandings or a lack of clarity."
IBM,4,5-Feb-24,Attracting & Retaining Top Talent: Optimizing Expat Benefits at IBM Malaysia,Direct Sales Team Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Petaling Jaya,"IBM is on track to become the top market cap company in the next 6-8 years.

Worked with outstanding people

Learning opportunities","Two key suggestions regarding expat benefits:

1. EPF Contribution for Expat Employees: With IBM Malaysia's rapid expansion and reliance on expat IT talent, I propose implementing an employer contribution to the EPF (Employees' Provident Fund) at the standard rate of 12%, aligning with industry practices. Currently, the RM5 contribution for expat managers falls short compared to the market and competitors like AWS, MS, Google, Veeam, and Cisco who offer full employer contributions as a key talent attraction strategy. This change would enhance competitiveness and employee satisfaction.

2. Improved Insurance Package: Exploring an insurance provider like AIA with a superior user experience and interface could be beneficial. Additionally, incorporating optical benefits would address the needs of many employees experiencing vision issues who currently need to purchase glasses separately. This demonstrates investment in employee well-being and aligns with best practices."

Legacy and Experience: With a history dating back over a century, IBM brings a wealth of experience to the table, which can be advantageous in understanding and addressing complex business challenges.","Challenges in Adaptation: The size and legacy of IBM can sometimes hinder its ability to adapt quickly to rapidly changing technology trends, potentially making it less agile compared to smaller competitors.

Competition: In the highly competitive tech industry, IBM faces stiff competition from other major players, which can impact market share and profitability.

Restructuring and Layoffs: IBM has undergone various restructuring efforts, including layoffs, to streamline its operations. While this is a common practice in the business world, it can impact employee morale and public perception.

Complexity of Offerings: The broad range of products and services offered by IBM may be overwhelming for some clients, and the complexity might lead to challenges in finding the right solutions for specific needs.

Revenue Challenges: IBM has faced revenue challenges in certain quarters, which may be attributed to shifts in technology spending or changes in market demand."

When I joined, I was told about how good the benefits were, and how IBM was a ""family."" In the past few years, that philosophy has been discarded. Every few months upper management makes sweeping policy changes, with no employee input, that significantly hurt US employees. When employees react en masse with concern, alarm, and constructive feedback, they ignore or gaslight us, or commit the strawman fallacy by mischaracterizing employees' concerns and then dismissing them. For example, in November 2023 (right after the employee engagement survey concluded), the did away with 401k matching, replacing it with a novel financial vehicle called an ""RBA"" with much lower yields, and tried to spin it as a good thing for us. Based on publicly available information, I'm estimating that this will probably save IBM at least $100M over the next decade in US benefits payouts. It also means IBM holds our retirement money, rather than the employee. IBM simply does not care about retaining talent right now -- if you are a senior or well-paid employee in the US, they see you as an expense, and they're showing you the door."

There is a general insecurity about where IBM is heading and what we actually do.

The environment rewards short-term deals-for-convenience, rather than an internal sense of mission or conviction. The internal pressure on daily utilisation, cost control and sales cadence calls is relentless. Most of the company’s human capital is burned measuring percentages and the inventing the next quarterly narrative for shareholders, rather than solving meaningful problems for clients, being bold or original."

To help the work environment be more collaborative, it streamlines lots of internal processes to make them more efficient and effective.
There are some effective communication channels between management and employees via instant messaging and online systems. The management can provide feedback to employees on their performance for their self-improvement and growth in their roles.
Also, the company recognizes and rewards employees for their achievements and contributions to the company through a mechanism like currency exchange for gifts and services in loyalty programs.",One thing I would like to suggest IBM improves is offering more flexible work arrangements or other benefits to help employees achieve a better work-life balance.

IBM,4,23-Jan-24,Overall it is a good company,Application Architect,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Hong Kong,"In my experience with IBM, overall, it is a good company, as it provides adequate opportunities for professional development, and keeps promoting a culture of respect, inclusivity, and collaboration in the work environment for employees and different teams in the company. To help the work environment be more collaborative, it streamlines lots of internal processes to make them more efficient and effective.
There are some effective communication channels between management and employees via instant messaging and online systems. The management can provide feedback to employees on their performance for their self-improvement and growth in their roles.
Also, the company recognizes and rewards employees for their achievements and contributions to the company through a mechanism like currency exchange for gifts and services in loyalty programs.",One thing I would like to suggest IBM improves is offering more flexible work arrangements or other benefits to help employees achieve a better work-life balance.

Did you have vacations on those days? Who cares, go and change your plans that managment ask you to save 13 weeks before.
Work phone? What is that? Give your personal number to client so they can call you 24/7. Oh and if you need any help from the owner of the app go call him with your own phone.
They ask you to work 40 hours, and you only register 40 hours. But you are also obligated to work 48 hours if they want. No extra hours payment.
100 dollars penalization, if you don't finish in one month a course they ask you to finish in 4 months ( you can get 6 of them at same time)

SAP training is over-emphasized, but there are few available SAP roles for Associates. Expect to waste your time learning things that will be obsolete by the time you are able to use them.

2) If you are in engine development team and a developer then you are safe here.","1) IBM ISL Kochi is a Hire and Fire Company. They took many floor and hiring many people in Kochi. When we look at the Firing count it is same as hiring count in each year.
2) IBM culture is based on a Manager game. For all other location a technical person become as manager. Unfortunately in Kochi almost every manager is non technical and they will not take any challenging work which make visibility because they dont know about that and if he took that work it is manager responsibility to complete on time. IBM wants visibility on works and team. As manager is the master he is not looking back and just fire some people from his/her team and prove that they are not performing and that is the reason the team is not inventing some new features. Everybody knows the exact reason by it is happening from bottom to top and now it become as IBM Culture.
3) Every half year there is a performance appraisal and put some people to PIP. Here PIP means terminating employees, I never seen any performance improvement plan provided to them instead the company ask them to resign otherwise will terminate you. Due to termination complication most of the employees agrees to resign but getting another job is very difficult as IBM provide high CTC.
4) If you are okay with two year Job in IBM with high salary then it is good. But please dont go to a different skill set in IBM. Because IBM ISL Kochi will fire you within 2 year and that time you will struggle to get another job."

Salary rise was minuscule this year (for me it was like 4% despite being above the expectation, and it was +- like this for everyone in the team). Getting promoted can take anywhere from 3 months to 9 months (actual case of my coworker who got promoted after waiting for 9 months and handing in a notice right before getting it) Return to the office makes no sense (3 days mandatory at least) and if one year ago I could write that IBM has good work-life balance, now I am not so sure about that. It is still better, than in the companies that work fully in the office, but looks like IBM is going there as well. And it's not like the office is any good.

IBM,2,21-Nov-23,Major Benefit Changes and Return to Office,Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","Austin, TX","When you have a great manager that protects you from upper management nonsense, its great","Here's the real reason I'm posting.

1. They've stopped 401k matching (6%) and have switched to a ""Retirement benefit account"" that matches 5% of your salary. The downside is two-fold, returns in the RBA pegged at 3% and you have zero choice in how its invested. If you're early to mid career this is a massive loss. Also because its an RBA and not a 401k you don't have the same protections and choice if something happens to IBM, at least with a 401k its your account, the RBA stays withing IBM's control until you leave

2. The return to office is extremely sloppy, sites not having enough workspace, ""come into the office or resign"" ultimatums...all of this because of poor planning"

Salary rise was minuscule this year (for me it was like 4% despite being above the expectation, and it was +- like this for everyone in the team). Getting promoted can take anywhere from 3 months to 9 months (actual case of my coworker who got promoted after waiting for 9 months and handing in a notice right before getting it) Return to the office makes no sense (3 days mandatory at least) and if one year ago I could write that IBM has good work-life balance, now I am not so sure about that. It is still better, than in the companies that work fully in the office, but looks like IBM is going there as well. And it's not like the office is any good.

1. They've stopped 401k matching (6%) and have switched to a ""Retirement benefit account"" that matches 5% of your salary. The downside is two-fold, returns in the RBA pegged at 3% and you have zero choice in how its invested. If you're early to mid career this is a massive loss. Also because its an RBA and not a 401k you don't have the same protections and choice if something happens to IBM, at least with a 401k its your account, the RBA stays withing IBM's control until you leave

2. The return to office is extremely sloppy, sites not having enough workspace, ""come into the office or resign"" ultimatums...all of this because of poor planning"

IBM,1,31-Jan-24,IBM tells managers to come to the office or leave their jobs - CNN,Senior Developer,"Former Employee, more than 10 years","Poughkeepsie, NY","You get a paycheck, this week.","This CNN headline on 1/31/24 is exactly why I left years ago as these so-called leaders were doing the same thing; cutting staff under the thin veil of what they called ""co-location"". It is nothing more than that. My advice? Leave! Your quality of life and career will improve, drastically. Just ask anyone that took the leap they'll all tell you the very same thing. There are still entire teams that even when on site, work at great distances from each other across vastly different time zones; they are not working together even when in an office - it's a ruse. Those of us that built what used to be idolized as the great IBM of old, is long gone. We built IBM's reputation - not the recent leadership (if you can even confer that on them). Also long gone and buried with Old Man Watson (9-edge, face down as they say) is the company's original mantra - ""Respect for the Individual"" and ""Think"" there is no respect anymore - and these greedy executives don't and can't think; employment is purely transactional and employees became faceless widgets long ago. Current employees are paid just enough but have been loaded with FUD - too scared to leave and ridden by first-line managers that only carry out orders from above after getting their spine-ectomies. Those with skills and value can do far better elsewhere and avoid getting stomach ulcers from living under constant anxiety. The new generation and top talent demand remote work options. My advice to you is this: take a clue - exclude Big Blue from your short list of best places to work, unless you want to work under constant FUD. Don't walk away - run!"

Google,4,21-Jun-13,"Moving at the speed of light, burn out is inevitable",Program Manager,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Mountain View, CA","1) Food, food, food.  15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone.  Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks.  Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus).  Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available.  Bowling alley.  Volley ball pit.  Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV).  Free health/fitness assessments.  Dog-friendly.  Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation.  In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically).  In practice, not true.  

6)  You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry.  There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).","1) Work/life balance.  What balance?  All those perks and benefits are an illusion.  They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive.  I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations.  You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down.  I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us.  Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am.  It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.

2) Poor management.  I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence.  Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult.""  People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into.  So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.  Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.

3) Jerks.  Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same).  Years ago, that wasn't the case.  I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience.  I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.

4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.  So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing.  Google says, ""Don't be evil.""  But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices.  :("
Google,5,10-May-14,"Great balance between big-company security and fun, fast-moving projects",Software Engineer III,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","New York, NY","* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).
* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.
* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.
* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.
* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).
* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.
* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.

Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.
* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.
* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).
* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.
* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture."
Google,5,8-Feb-15,The best place I've worked and also the most demanding.,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,"Mountain View, CA","You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.

You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world

You'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management.

You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing

You'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable. 

There are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free.

Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.

Google cares about how it treats its employees.

The campus is like an academic campus in many ways.

There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.

You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.

If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors. 

The company is flexible - if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don't get me wrong - you'll work a LOT. But you don't have to do all of it chained to your desk.","I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.

Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.

You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning.  No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing - which is kind of hard.

After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear. 

It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.

When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you.  Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.

It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge.   I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out."

One of the most striking aspects of Google's culture is its unwavering commitment to fostering creativity and pushing boundaries. From day one, I was encouraged to think outside the box, experiment with new technologies, and challenge the status quo. The emphasis on innovation is palpable in every project and team meeting, creating an environment where groundbreaking ideas flourish.

Moreover, the level of talent and expertise among my colleagues is unparalleled. Working alongside some of the brightest minds in the industry has not only accelerated my professional development but has also inspired me to strive for excellence in everything I do. The collaborative spirit at Google is truly remarkable, with teams coming together seamlessly to tackle complex problems and deliver world-class solutions.

In addition to the stimulating work environment, Google places a strong emphasis on employee well-being and work-life balance.

Furthermore, the flexibility to work remotely has been invaluable, allowing me to maintain a healthy balance between my professional and personal life.","However, it's worth noting that Google's fast-paced environment may not be suitable for everyone.

The company's commitment to fostering a positive and inclusive work environment has created a culture of collaboration and mutual respect that I truly value. Google's dedication to employee growth, with ongoing training and development opportunities, has not only enhanced my skills but also provided a clear path for career progression.

Google's emphasis on work-life balance, reflected in flexible arrangements and comprehensive wellness programs, has contributed to a positive and thriving work atmosphere. Transparent communication from leadership fosters a sense of trust and unity, making Google not just a workplace but a community. In summary, Google stands out as an outstanding place to work, offering a supportive culture, ample growth opportunities, and a healthy work-life balance. I highly recommend Google to those seeking a fulfilling and rewarding career.","While Google is undoubtedly a remarkable company to work for, like any workplace, it's essential to consider potential challenges. Here are some cons to be aware of:

Intense Work Environment: Google is known for its fast-paced and dynamic work environment. For some individuals, the pressure and pace may be challenging to manage, leading to potential stress or burnout.

Large Organization Challenges: Being a massive multinational corporation, Google's sheer size can sometimes result in bureaucracy and slower decision-making processes. Navigating through the organizational hierarchy may require patience and persistence.

High Expectations: Google sets high expectations for its employees, aiming for innovation and excellence. While this can be motivating, it may also create a demanding atmosphere where meeting and exceeding expectations becomes the norm."

- Compensation (they aim for top 10% so there are definitely other options)","- Run by ex-McKinsey and 2008 financial crisis big-bank veterans
- The worst treatment of employees I have ever seen during their layoffs. Cutting off corp access abruptly, not disclosing to teams and employees who was let go from their teams. In many cases, blatantly lying to employees when justifying these actions 
- Employees on visas were severely mistreated and disadvantaged on their ability to collect severance during ""extended notice layoffs""
- Perks are being constantly removed and teams/projects cut
- Management seemingly has 0 control of their organizations
- Management of entire product areas are upward-failing and seemingly have no passion for their organizations. They lead organizations the size of normal companies and treat it like just a line item on a resume
- Once a leader in diversity/inclusion they have proven that they do not care about these efforts at all since they were the first thing on the chopping block. Even their diverse employees that are on visas were especially mistreated at the first sign of a market down turn
- Severely senior-skewing engineering. You will likely have no opportunities for career advancement"

The company provides its employees with exceptional benefits, including comprehensive healthcare, generous parental leave, and flexible work schedules, promoting a healthy work-life balance. Google's open culture encourages creativity and collaboration, allowing ideas to flourish and employees to grow their careers in diverse directions. Access to cutting-edge technology and resources enables individuals to work on projects that impact millions of users worldwide, making their work incredibly fulfilling and impactful.","Despite the many advantages, working at Google comes with its set of challenges. The highly competitive environment can be stressful, with high expectations and performance metrics to meet, leading to work-life balance issues for some. The company's size can sometimes result in bureaucratic hurdles, making it difficult to push new initiatives forward quickly. Additionally, the intense focus on innovation and constant change may not suit everyone, as it requires adaptability and a continuous learning mindset. For some, the culture of being always ""on"" and the pressure to excel can be overwhelming, overshadowing the benefits."
Google,4,12-Feb-24,A company with a strong engineering culture that is slowly stagnating from management,Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Chicago, IL","Google has a rich history of engineering excellence and brilliance. Even many years removed from the height of the company's innovation, some of this is still evident through a strongly ingrained engineering culture where things are mostly done in an engineering first mindset. Engineering excellence is obvious across the organization and the products/infrastructure built at Google are a testament to this.

Work life balance is, for the most part, extremely good and good work life balance is ingrained in the culture. I have never experienced pressure from managers to work more than 40 hours a week, and the vacation + holidays are decent (though maybe not the absolute best).","There is a clear lack of vision from top management as many of Google's recent ""big"" initiatives seem to be reactive to other tech companies (instead of proactive). When compared to top executives at similar large companies, the current management falls quite short.

A complicated performance/promotion process exists at Google in an effort to measure employees fairly across the large company, however this comes at the cost of wasted cycles and the gamification of the system. This, along with the large variation in teams results in non-uniform opportunities for promotion/career advancement."

Learning and Growth: Google provides ample opportunities for professional development and learning. As an L4, I found myself constantly challenged and learning new things. The company supports attending conferences, taking courses, and even has its own internal platforms for continued learning.

Talented Peers: One of the most enriching aspects of working at Google is the chance to collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the industry. The level of talent and expertise among colleagues is exceptional, fostering a culture of excellence and innovation.

Work-Life Balance: Google is known for its employee-friendly policies. The company offers flexible working hours, and there is a genuine respect for personal time and work-life balance. This aspect is especially appreciated in the tech industry, where burnout can be common.","Large Company Bureaucracy: Being a part of such a large company can sometimes mean navigating through layers of bureaucracy. Decision-making processes can be slow, and there can be a significant amount of red tape in getting things done.

Competitive Environment: While working with talented peers is a pro, it can also lead to a highly competitive environment. There can be pressure to constantly perform at your best, which might be overwhelming for some."

If you do large projects and keep your managers in the loop (like one should as L3 and L4), they say you need hand-holding. If you try to do things independently, they say you are being insubordinate. There's no one way that you can go. Managers outright lie in performance reviews. Add info or projects that were never delegated to you, and even if you escalate it, no one takes note of it, and you become the bad guy. They also like being boot-licked, and such people are showered with spot and peer bonuses for their regular tasks, tasks they were hired for. I will run out of examples, the fact is Google is a sham, and it's worse because they sell ""Googlyness"". It's laughable. No career growth and projects just don't launch. If there's more work and you end up working on a holiday, your manager will put that as your incompetence.

Perks and Benefits: Google offers a wide range of perks such as free meals, fitness centers, laundry services, and more. Additionally, their employee benefits package is often considered one of the best, including health care, retirement plans, and generous parental leave policies.

Learning and Development Opportunities: Employees at Google have access to various learning resources and professional development programs. This environment encourages continuous learning and growth, enabling employees to enhance their skills and advance in their careers.","Work-Life Balance Challenges: Due to the demanding nature of the work and a culture that often celebrates 'going the extra mile', some employees find it challenging to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

Competitive Environment: While being surrounded by highly talented individuals can be inspiring, it can also create a highly competitive atmosphere. This can sometimes lead to stress and pressure to perform at very high levels constantly.

Large Company Bureaucracy: As a large corporation, Google has its share of bureaucracy. This can mean slower decision-making processes, less autonomy in certain roles, and the potential for getting lost in the corporate structure, making it harder for some individuals to make a significant impact."

• The majority of employees are kind and respectful aka. ""googley""
• There are numerous product teams to try new things and grow 
• Lots of internal resources to grow one's career, leadership, and skill set","Google used to have an amazing company culture and flat structural leadership. It's what made Google unique and stand out from the rest. Google has since lost it's overall 'unique company culture' by squeezing out innovation unless its perfecting AI to beat out its competitors. Company moral has tanked, employee input no longer feels authentically heard, valued, and actionable, budget constraints have caused a slim chance in promotion - even when consistently demonstrating next level performance. It's also become difficult to transfer btwn different teams to grow one's Google career. Headcount and resources have been restricted, resulting in stiff competition when applying to new roles.
Google has become another heavy, top-down corporate enterprise using tall organizational structure for more leadership control.
I have truly enjoyed working at Google for many years. These past 2-3 years have really flipped in the opposite way. My hope is that Sundar and leadership revert to putting Googlers and users first, rather than stock and revenue."

Of course, with the size of Google now, at least you can change jobs and find new opportunities for your career without ever leaving the company.","Engineering development is more of a popularity contest. There is very little coherent product management, so the Engineering leads who can make the best product pitch move forward, until they get bored and lose headcount, then Google cancels the product. Software platforms aren't standardized, every team can re-invent the wheel. There is very little interoperability between products, so you can't even leverage what other people have built.
Let's add to that rampant ""brogrammer"" culture, and horrible mistreatment of women. As a woman, you have to have a thick skin to get by, but if you're too brusque and forget to be warm and nurturing you'll be accused of ""being a btich"" or ""not a team player"" or ""difficult to work with."""

You'll notice this immediately, even though management does not.","Workers are no longer valued. Those most knowledgable about Apple products, policies, and the culture of Apple, people who have been with the company 5, 10 even 20 years... are being quiet-cut, or cut altogether.... by the hundreds. You are managed almost entirely through cold automated systems, and management is really only there to help interpret. 

So called ""opportunities"" come in the form of temporary positions only, usually in a role that would be higher paying, but as a temp you will retain your pay rate, despite performing more advanced tasks. When they have gotten their use of you, you are shipped back to over-worked positions not desired by those who have connections you don't have. 

You'll be told that your reviews, your participation in projects and ""voluntary"" tasks will propel you forward, however even years of consistently exceeding expectations, accolades and involvement will never get you past the favoritism, nepotism, and cronyism.

Management has a complete disconnect, with those whom they manage. They essentially act as messengers at some-point in a grape-vine between investors, and staff. They will deliver a message, if you have questions, concerns, or disagreement, you will get the standard corporate speak ""We hear you, we understand and we'll be sure to send your concerns up"", but you will never hear back, concerns will never be addressed, you will just get fed those same corporate speaking lines. 

Workers have little to no input (this was not always the case, even at a company as large as Apple), if you call out any type of issue, you'll be gaslit and told the issue is really you."
Apple,5,14-Feb-24,It is very good,Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Minneapolis, MN","- Working on cutting-edge technology. Apple is known for innovative products and pushing the boundaries of technology. Engineers get to develop new and exciting technologies.

- Strong work culture and benefits. Apple is known for having a great company culture with healthy work-life balance, generous benefits, and perks like free snacks and devices. 

- Career growth opportunities. As a large and successful company, Apple offers plenty of room for advancement as new projects and teams are constantly being created.

- Product-focused work. Engineers work directly on Apple's flagship consumer products like the iPhone, iPad, Mac, etc. rather than more mundane backend systems.","- High expectations and pressure to perform. Apple is known for perfectionism and demanding high quality. This can add stress.

- Secrecy and NDAs. Much of Apple's future product plans are confidential. This limits what engineers can share about their work externally. 

- Bureaucracy of a large company. More red tape and process compared to a startup. Projects take longer to complete.

- Competitive hiring. Very difficult to land a job at Apple due to high number of applicants for each opening.

- Less flexibility andremote work. Apple's culture focuses heavily on collaboration in physical offices, limiting remote work possibilities.

- Potentially lower pay compared to top tech companies given current compensation structure.

Overall, Apple provides a unique experience for engineers to work on cutting-edge consumer technologies, but also comes with expectations of discretion, bureaucracy, and less flexibility than some other companies."

Apple,4,24-Nov-23,Best Retail Pay and Benefits,Specialist,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","San Diego, CA","It’s a fun, fast-paced environment. Specialists don’t work on commissions so we really get to enjoy talking about the products and services - because we believe in them! Wages increase each year. Benefits are generous with many choices and programs.","Scheduling is consistently a problem. It’s truly the only reason I have this job 4 stars. We are regularly given big promises to work with our life requirements, but policies favor young unmarried people with no kids. If you have any personal obligations other than being in college, prepare to fight for any real control over the schedule you are given. FORGET having set hours… I really do love working at Apple! However, I struggle to give my best work when I have to drastically rearrange my family life and spiritual life (which COULD be on a regular schedule) every two weeks. Apple says it has a diverse work force and all of their marketing promotes that, but their retail stores do not have that at all."

6. They’re strict about time off and your availability
7. No room for career growth, do not come to retail thinking you will become a manager long term. You can stay as a specialist for 10 years.
8. Raises have become 1-3% down from 6-10% per year.
9. Hard labour, you’re on your feet all day, they micromanage your breaks+how often you go to the washroom. They get upset if you need a breather when you’re on the sales floor.

5. You can make some friends after ramping together several products.","1.

2. No career development, you can stay as entry level for more than 10 years if not good at showing off or on low visibility projects. 
3. Visibility based performance, instead of actual deliverable. Senior leadership have no willing to understand what team's doing, and have little care of its people, feel just like being a replaceable tool.
4. Internal transfer is harder than external hire, same rounds of interviews + performance req + need notify current manager that you plan to leave before 1st round interview.

- no task will be completed without your manager double checking every single forecast you come up with as they don't trust your abilities and love to micromanage people
- when highlighting how bad direct management is to their superior, they just mask it as the employees fault, which means you are now ""black listed"" as difficult
- when you point out all the things you've done and how well you performed, managers will backtrack and say they never said the things they did and you ""misunderstood""
- they are also very biased towards Irish people and any expat will have to work twice as hard to see any recognition meanwhile you have to complete the unconscious Bias training on a yearly basis
- Apple will hire people above your pay grade with less experience and put them into senior positions, which means you will train them, do their work and yours meanwhile getting paid less and having to work harder to prove your senior status
- when you try to move departments to escape your management, your application might be blocked by said management and you'll be given excuses about you not meeting the requirements even though you are a native speaker and in fact the only person, who speaks the language they are looking for and already working with the team and knowing the job inside out

- Other employee benefits aside from healthcare are nice. 
- The campus is well maintained and nice
- The caffe has great food that is pretty inexpensive for what you get. 
- On campus gym (but it's getting more expensive for some reason)
- Discounts on Apple and third party products/ services
- Occasionally you'll get free swag. 
- Occasionally there are campus parties. Not so much since covid, and never as good as Cupertino.","TL; DR:

- Near zero growth opportunity within AppleCare, and very hard to be seen as a viable candidate to the rest of Apple.
- Career growth pacification programs that provide no real advancement or growth.
- Restrictive rotation and career experience programs. Rather than allowing you to flourish and apply for real world experiences from other departments as much as you'd like, you are restricted to once every six months to a year. 
- Every six months your schedule will likely change, upending your personal life.
- You get hired for a specific role, then get various other roles dumped on you with no pay raise.
- Management will randomly move you around to different managers, desks for no reason. 
- Management either does not care about you, or has no power to make real change when necessary, so they just BS around everything. 

Oh man. I've grown into a bit of a curmudgeon during my time here, so I've definitely got cons. Despite what some will ultimately believe is some sad sack who sabotages themselves into being where they are, that is not the case. I'm not saying that my feelings haven't spilled out over the years, but I mainly keep this stuff inside and uphold composure. All of this stuff is true. 

- Sadly, if you have a hunger and desire to grow your career and advance within Apple and you came to AppleCare (AC) thinking that this would at least be a nice starting place, you have chosen poorly. AC is where talented individuals get trapped within a sea of mediocrity and complacency. So many people are just ""meh"" and have no desire to advance, therefore you cannot advance within the organization, and since it's Apple, it's already extremely competitive, so when opportunities that you would qualify for (which are few and far between unless you're a hardware engineer or programmer with years of experience) open up, it's nearly impossible to stand out to a recruiter for them to even give you the time of day. 

- Because the executive and upper management level of AC know that there are next to zero opportunities due to the competitive nature of Apple, they have created a career growth program designed to make you feel like they care, like there is possible opportunity, and that this program will somehow benefit you, despite it not providing much in the way of anything. They have ""career coaches"" that have barely had a career themselves (seriously, they had the same job that you have right now, then became coaches. Give me someone who has actually advanced), they give you free access to Coursera, which is nice, but it does nothing to make up for the lack of experience or education most roles require, and it offers what are called ""rotations"" which is where you work for another team for up to six months getting real world experience likely doing a job that you'd actually want to do (but without the pay), however the likelihood of getting a job from a rotation is about as likely as you getting struck by lightning on a clear day in the desert as the majority of the orgs that offer rotations are given zero budget for additional headcount. They are perpetually stuck rotating new people in and out every six months. They hate it as much as we do. They wish they could hire some of us as much as we wish we could be hired. 

We're all restricted to one rotation per six months, so in the event to where you'd be amazing for a role that maybe, just maybe might just wind up being able to hire you, too bad so sad. You're stuck in your regular job watching someone else advance who's been there a fraction of the time that you have simply because they were in the right place at the right time. To rub additional salt into the wound, we get emails on the rare occasion that someone is actually hired off of a rotation, as if the career site had anything to do with it. Even better, they've barely even worked at Apple, going from a retail role to just skipping right over you making six figures easy. Now, I assume they're an amazing person who is killing it, but I don't know. What I do know is that I never got the opportunity to present like this person did because of this stupid ""one rotation every six months"" rule. 

- Once every six months your schedule will most likely change, potentially upending your life. It's Apple, right. If they put out a request for people to work odd hours, they would still get a crazy amount of applicants, but for whatever reason, rather than hiring for a specific shift, we all get judged by our metrics. These are metrics that are impossible to perfect due to the nature of our job, so no matter how hard one might try to get perfect metrics so that in turn you get first pick of your schedule, it won't happen. So, you might work from 7am to 4 pm half the year, then 11 am to 8pm the other half. Maybe you need weekends off because you have kids who are enrolled in sports and you want to be there to support them. Too bad so sad if your metrics weren't good enough to get first pick. Whereas once you may have worked Monday thru Friday, now you work Saturday thru Wednesday, or have two random days off rather than consecutively. 

- You get hired for a specific job, then over time you literally take on the job of several other organizations. Let's say you get hired to assist Mac and iPhone customers. Cool - two products (though, these products include all of the built-in apps and services). You can become a master over these two things and get amazing feedback from all of your customers, i.e. excel in your role. Then, the org decides that they want to take on a completely new products because they want to merge your org with what once was a separate org for ""reasons"", and it happens again, and again, and again... and no - you aren't paid more because of it. Now, you're supporting Mac, iOS, lets say Apple Watch, Apple Pay, Apple Fitness +, the Apple TV, Apple TV+, Apple Vision Pro, Apple whatever, therefore you knowledge gets very diluted and you are overall a less helpful person who to a customer doesn't sound like you know what you're doing. 

On top of that, management can't help but want to shake things up for no good reason, so you're often moved around within the office space itself, and you're often moved around to different managers, or to managers that you previously already had, then got moved from, and are now back under. It's like they have nothing better to do, or some budget that they don't want to lose access to and moving us around ""costs money"" or something. You create this fantastic working relationship with those around you, helping each other out, getting to really know people, then BAM! you get moved. Sometimes you get to start over and really get to know a whole new group of people that are awesome, but sometimes you get sat next to some guy that doesn't shower, sleeps all day only to be woken up by a phone call before attempting to nap again, or are sat next to someone who has anger management issues and slams their hands against the desk because every single customer frustrates them, etc. No wonder they treat AppleCare like children - it can be a daycare sometimes. I don't know why they allow this kind of thing to continue. 

- Management doesn't care about you. Any time you bring up a legitimate issue, you have to set up a meeting for when they're available, which can be weeks later sometimes, only to be given some really politically correct, BS response where nothing happens. It's like everyone is just biding their time, waiting to retire or die, and no one wants to ""rock the boat"". They want to talk the talk, but not walk the walk."

Customers are going to make you upset, the store will always be busy, and you will be asked to put on a smile at all times. Also, there are many employees and finding a full-time role is rare. In my case, the store leader and senior manager were mediocre and they only cared about themselves and their little clique. It was condescending and also ironic that a ""store leader"" and ""senior manager"" who did not know how any of the products work can tell you that you need to improve performance when they cannot offer help themselves. They would just hide in their office and ignore the madness of the store, especially during peak hours on the weekend (part of the reason why we were always behind on appointments). Additionally, we would be required to put in PTO a month and half or two months before the actual date while they were always out on vacation. It was demeaning and obvious that they did not care about the overall happiness of their employees. 

Also, the worst feeling about working at this store location is that senior management did not promote from within, when the store had so many talented people who could lead this location to success. There were so many employees who spent years working here that were overlooked for leadership roles when they 100% deserved it. Instead, it would be common for leadership to hire externally and bring on people who had no tech savviness whatsoever. Again, it would feel demeaning to have an outside hire manager/lead try to rate your performance when they didn't even know how to use an iPhone."

Apple,3,13-Jan-24,Its ok for like a year or two but don't expect many career opportunities,Specialist,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Melbourne,"The team are excellent, you make lifelong friends with most people, includes free private healthcare, university reimbursement (up to 5k per year) and 700 reimbursement for gym membership (but don't expect any free products).

The culture does teach you a lot about resilience, your journey can teach you even more about navigating complex issues (but expect to learn most of that on your own).

Word of advice, don't tell anyone anything (they will use it against you) and stay far AWAY from Experts and Pros they are not your friends, they're self serving paid snitches who tell managers everything.","The worst aspect is a customer review works as 5 starts is 100% BUT 4 stars is 50%... HOW IS THAT FAIR!? One review can absolutely NOSE DIVE your team member score... PLUS there is no tangible incentive (especially when you consider each PT team member can sell around $1.5-2 million in products annually) then they say you're not meeting expectations which is BS. When you consider the amount of sales team members do in a year, no bonuses are absolutely ridiculous... Not even a Christmas party! They'll provide chips and chocolate in the break room (cough cough where's the fruit)

The expectations of customers are absolutely RIDICULOUS! Customers expect you to know everything on a measly wage, can often be very demanding and just insist 'you do everything' and don't actually listen. Management doesn't empower team to say 'no'... Expect to be dealing with a lot of customers of ALL ages (Gen Z to Boomers) who are completely incompetent and not interested in learning the basics instead they come into the Apple Store with all their issues they could easily solve with the most basic problem solving skills.

Culture can feel overwhelming and fake, recently the culture has shifted to more results focused with no financial or tangible rewards, they manipulate you to pursue growth but it's literally IMPOSSIBLE to grow to their expectations unless you sell your soul to them.

Most managers are absolutely useless at providing any assistance when you're facing challenges with customers, will often bend to customers or reverse the question so YOU have to deal with them. But have to shout out to the few who work very hard and are incredible.

The stock program rewards staff with a 1.5k bonus with stocks each year but they vest over 3 years... So it's just another way to manipulate people to stay."

Once you off-board from a client project, you better pray to God that you find another one (and yes, I mean YOU because you are pretty much on your own finding one) because they only give you 35 days not being on a project and they give you the boot. This isn't considered a 'Layoff' where the news is concerned so it's a backdoor way for them to not have to tell the world/investors that they layed off a WAY bigger percentage of their workforce than they want to admit. I, thankfully have been on a client project consistently but how they have gotten rid of incredibly talented and valuable people based on this policy is a complete joke. I have zero respect for the leadership and I can't wait for the day that I find a better opportunity elsewhere. Another thing, they rate employees on a 1-5 scale at the end of the year and that is supposed to reflect in your raise, well, last year even people rated at a 4 & 5 (the highest) got the same size raise as lower-rated employees. So all of us who broke our backs for this company were basically told that we were worth the same amount as someone who did the bare minimum or even less. Total insult!"

They acquired Nuance 7 months ago and now another company is acquiring them. People who do not work basically get to do whatever they want. While the hard workers have to pick up all the slack. No raises at all. Refuse to pay any OT ever even when your clinic is busy.

Also, the teams I have been on have been pretty strong with smart people.","How much time to do you have? Years before the company I worked for was acquired by Cognizant, I worked on a team with other consultants, mostly from Cognizant. None had anything good to say about the firm and several, independent of one another, urged me never to sign on with Cognizant because they treat their people terribly. Well several years later the company I worked for was acquired and I had no choice. I tried to hang in there but it's clear employees do not matter. Now I understand why I was warned. 
A number of times last year, the former CEO sent emails first urging return to office, then stating he was disappointed to see so many offices. I was hired as a fully remote employee and was not the only one, yet there was no negotiation about this supposed The two clients I worked with last year were in a different time zone and I was the only team member in my city. Further, local offices sent out communications indicating that they had very limited desk space that needed to be reserved in advance. Why would I travel an hour from home to be the only one on my team at a local office, which may or may not be able to provide a workspace? For optics? No thanks. I never went in.

Recently Cognizant eliminated unlimited PTO and gave everyone across the board, regardless of tenure, less than industry standard PTO.

Another requirement that makes no sense is that employees are required to complete a week's worth of training - on their own time each year - in order to qualify for paltry increases. However, training is internal and absolutely a waste of time. No professional learns anything from their incredibly weak training modules, which by the way rarely run without timing out, even with the best wifi connection. One of the perks Cognizant likes to promote is that they will pay for up to two certifications per year, but even when approval is granted, getting it approved is a series of hoops that doesn't seem worth the frustration. When that is complete, getting a reimbursement is again, long, difficult, and exhausting. The team overseeing the reimbursements outright rejects complete and accurate requests over and over without review. When you escalate it, they approve only to reject it last minute before payroll is finalized, several times. If you survive all of this and have 3-4 months to dedicate, they eventually pay you back, but it hardly seems worth it at that point. (This is sadly not an exaggeration and happened to me personally 3 separate times. I have since just paid out of pocket for any certifications I am interested in. 

 There is little to no support from HR or management. Home managers change every few months with no warning. Even figuring out to who to talk to in various business units when you need internal support is virtually impossible. When an assignment ends, it is your responsibility to find your own next assignment or be laid off. I took a job as a consultant because my prior firm would task a manager to find roles in the pipeline that would be a good fit for your skillset or one that would grow your skillset if that's something you were interested in. Those days are long gone since we fully transitioned to the cognizant way of doing things. You are required to use an archaic tool that is supposed to do a skills match but gets it wrong about 95% of the time and managers rarely respond to job applications or close them because roles are indefinitely on hold or were earmarked for a consultant already on the project. You are either matched with jobs you have no skillset for - and pressured to apply - or get matched with jobs that are earmarked for outside recruiting. Meanwhile management strongly encourages benched staff to apply for and take jobs they are not qualified. For example, if youre a senior associate you are pressured to go for manager jobs, but most manager jobs are not marked for promotion, so even if you can manage the workload and skillset, you do not get a promotion nor the appropriate pay adjustment for the role. Billing the highest possible rate is is all they care about and when roles do match, they prioritize offshore resources (who they pay far less for the same work) and college recruits (who again, they pay far less for the same work). It is very clear the organization and individual business units are not invested in keeping talent. 

It is a lonely and depressing organization to work for. Do not do it. Run."

Also, the teams I have been on have been pretty strong with smart people.","How much time to do you have? Years before the company I worked for was acquired by Cognizant, I worked on a team with other consultants, mostly from Cognizant. None had anything good to say about the firm and several, independent of one another, urged me never to sign on with Cognizant because they treat their people terribly. Well several years later the company I worked for was acquired and I had no choice. I tried to hang in there but it's clear employees do not matter. Now I understand why I was warned. 
A number of times last year, the former CEO sent emails first urging return to office, then stating he was disappointed to see so many offices. I was hired as a fully remote employee and was not the only one, yet there was no negotiation about this supposed The two clients I worked with last year were in a different time zone and I was the only team member in my city. Further, local offices sent out communications indicating that they had very limited desk space that needed to be reserved in advance. Why would I travel an hour from home to be the only one on my team at a local office, which may or may not be able to provide a workspace? For optics? No thanks. I never went in.

All about similar age groups, so its pretty fun

Btw, saw many cons about the company or the team here...Honestly I think it varies from person to person and whether you vibe with your manager (works the same everywhere tbh)...and tendency for someone to get chased by managers or people is probably because you're always MIA, not replying on time or just not interested to be productive when you should. So if you're prompt and responsible, your life pretty chill tbh...just got to get your stuff tgth.

In simple words, at least for the cons I see here, chances are these people didn't perform very well and so they faced more wrath from their managers so their experience tends to be bad...but well, just my honest opinion. Chill yall, its actually pretty alright here :)","- True that KPIs and directions change a lot, but seriously what do you expect from an ecommerce industry? it is what it is, dont expect it to be like I dk, Government sector or NTUC where it's old school and stable. Because it's so competitive in this industry, you always got to adapt and go with a different plan."

Also the management push back hard on flexible WFH policies even though a lot of the employees requested."
Shopee,1,20-Jan-24,Terrible,Business Development,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Kuala Lumpur,"real life drama, can save money for Netflix subscription","-First time in my life, I ever heard of a company that doesn't assess employees based on KPIs.
-Pathetic benefits, only RM150 for optical. What stoneage year does a pair of spectacles cost RM150? Also company secretly change policy without informing everyone, hoping everyone will quietly accept it. It then caused a huge commotion btw.
-Lousy communication channels, mostly use messenger to communicate. Imagine staffs using the same group chat to gossip and comms work related stuff, you have to scroll 200+ msges to not miss out on work stuffs.
-forces you to WFO cause according to management this is more ""productive"". Then you get employees staring at the screen with nothing to do, play phone, sleep during working hours. 
-HR is useless as they are just there to ensure you don't sue the company. Everything is ""top management's decision"". Always be aware as they could retract your offer even after you signed.
-Gave employees food poisoning during annual celebration and their feedback for employees is to ""take care"". Still have to go back to office btw
-No career advancement. Managers prefer button pushers and block out all suggestions. Brown nose working culture as they spend more time to please bosses instead of making real changes."
Shopee,2,10-Aug-21,Only if I knew this beforehand,Analyst,Current Employee,Singapore,"1. People are generally nice, minimal/no office politics

2. Everyone is willing to share and offer help when necessary","1. Brief hierarchy of the company: Team Assistant (TA); Associate; Senior Associate; So on and so forth. If you just graduate from NUS/NTU/SMU, the entry level position offered to you will be Associate. If you're from any other local/private unis in SG, the entry level position the company deem suited for you is TA. So you may graduate the same year as your friend but they may be your superior because of your school:) These are applicable for fresh grads and majority of the teams only. 

TLDR, as a TA, you're basically everybody's assistant. You take instructions from anyone above your ""rank""

2. Your day end at 7PM, so naturally you will miss your usual dinner time with your family and friends taking into consideration the travel time. (Timing can never match with your friends unless they starve and wait for you)

3. OT is norm and not paid (you feel elated when you're able to get out of office on time and still see bright sky lol. dont try to plan anything outside of work cause tasks are unpredictable and you may be given a task at 630PM and they expect you to complete asap)

4. Managers check in with you time to time and after sharing your concerns, work are still given to you (mgrs check for the sake of checking, they also need to report mah)

5. People are still working on leave/after office hours. Receiving messages and emails at 12AM? norm

6. If you speak chinese
a) awesome cause you can 'blend"" in easier and mgrs are generally glad to hear that you speak their mother tongue language
b)boo cause you need to help your non-chinese speaking teammates (not their fault btw) with their work AKA translation. ppl from other teams will prefer to seek help from you than your teammate since they can communicate better with you in their language

7. No clear career progression, job scope not defined (always doing work with no background given)

8. Turnover rate high. around half of my teammates has left after staying for less than 6 months or before their 3 months probation. The burnout is real:)

9. Work is extremely manual. Time spent on Crtl C + Crtl V takes up your whole day, thats why the company needs TA

10. The only time you get to interact with your teammates is lunch time/ team bonding session (usually held after work but will still attend cause FOMO)"

No doubt you'll talk tech (mostly the MSFT stack) from enterprise to consumer - from PCs to phones to Xboxes - from datacenter to desktop.

2.  What were GREAT benefits are now VERY GOOD (took a small step down) but still probably better than you'll find at 99% of large corporations.  If you've got family - the value of the benefits is even higher.  401k match is nice.

3.  Even with it's struggles MSFT is still a cash printing machine.  This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work, you can have a stable job, pay your bills, feed your family, and not worry (too much) about layoffs.  The stock you own likely won't tank, but probably won't go up much either.  You'll get a bonus each year and some stock.  It's a decent life if you aren't looking to light the world on fire.","Brand on Your Resume:  After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there's 90,000 employees, don't think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies.

Managing Your Career:  Make you say this out loud so it registers - 90,000 employees work there.  Double that for vendors.  It is VERY hard to ""stand out"" and move up in the company.  Don't expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals - they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too.  Not familiar with the stack rank?  Check out the 2012 Vanity Fair article called ""Microsoft's Lost Decade""."
Microsoft,4,10-Feb-24,Can be a great place to work if you find a good team,Senior Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Redmond, WA","* Ability to switch jobs internally within Microsoft to work on all different kinds of projects in all areas of software. Different teams have different cultures and practices, so look for a team that's a good match for you.
* In general, the culture is improving on customer focus and growth mindset. Although management can be political and chaotic, the folks at the ground level generally are supportive of each other and stiving to make the best, most positive products that they can.
* Lots of resources to do things on a large scale and have a big impact.
* Microsoft takes ethics seriously and has a real commitment to doing the right thing.","* Difficult environment for innovation. Microsoft tends to be better at improving existing products than creating new ones. Microsoft puts a lot of effort into innovating, but it often reorganizes, changes directions, or cancels projects before things can pan out.
* Lots of meetings and process that comes with being a large company that has to coordinate between teams.
* Although this isn't generally the case, some ""old Microsoft"" teams can be very stressful and power struggles between teams and leaders are common."
Microsoft,4,7-Jan-24,Good company to work for,Senior Product Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"As far as big corporations go, Microsoft is one of the best ones to work. The company culture is overall great. They emphasize a growth mindset and try to care about people. They have strong emphasis on diversity and inclusion which helps everyone think about how to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment. The pay and benefits are competitive. Because of all the products they work on, you can work on different products and move teams without leaving the company. They’re also making a lot of great strategic decisions which gives me faith in the leadership and direction they’re headed.","While the company culture overall is good and they try to emphasize good values, it’s a huge company so you can have a vast difference in experience depending on where you work. If you’re interviewing, make sure you meet with your hiring manager, evaluate them and ask questions about the culture of the team. 
A lot of work is still Seattle centric which makes it difficult to be visible if you’re new and remote, impacting promotions, influence, etc.
If you’re getting hired for a PM position, make sure you understand what is expected from the role. It looks vastly different depending on the product and its needs. I would recommend staying away from products that aren’t growing, especially as a PM."
Microsoft,3,23-Jan-24,More of a Program Management shop,Sr. Product Manager,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Chicago, IL","Company employees are very nice, helpful, down to earth and very family oriented. Opportunities within the company are plenty; I also think though no experienced yet that the troubles you have to get into a type of Product role you don't have experience in, is not faced once you are within. However, you do you have to go through all rounds of interviews like external candidates except 1 or 2 rounds if you are within the same overall organization from the top.","Company still isn't doing true Product Management and is much more Program Management oriented. Don't get me wrong; I am sure there are few products that do run a Product shop but I had been hard pressed to find them. Also, organization is very siloed and broken up so there are so many dependencies across departments which slows down how fast you can generate impact."
Microsoft,4,22-Jan-24,Handled layoffs respectfully,Senior Software Engineer,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",,"I only worked at Microsoft for about 8 months after my company was acquired by them, but had a positive experience overall. A lot of nice benefits, good pay, and opportunities if you're able to find the right role for yourself.

My position was eventually eliminated and I was laid off, but was given 3 months of severance pay and felt that Microsoft handled the process with dignity. Obviously nobody wants to get that call, but it ended up being a good catalyst for my career and having the 3 months of full salary/benefits to take a break and job search was really nice.","As with other large corporations there's a lot of bureaucracy and rigid process. Hard for me to comment much further due to my short stint and unique situation with the corporate transition as noted above. They also were going to have us give up our MacBooks, which is hardly a surprise given that it's Microsoft, but that was very unpopular with most of the engineers coming into the organization."
Microsoft,3,15-Feb-24,Teams consist of people who've worked in the same team for at least 5 years,Software Engineer II,Former Employee,"Redmond, WA",They know in's an out's of the product.,"Good luck getting them to share openly. 
This doesn't speak for MSFT as a whole, but people who stay at a place longer tend to have set preferences, don't want things to change too much, can be hostile towards people who are new and different in their approach.
Good luck communicating with such folks.
MSFT has been a stable company where people tend to stay long. 
Its good for their stability, but there is a reason you need diversity."
Microsoft,4,13-Feb-24,Good place to work as a lifestyle job,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Atlanta, GA",They prioritize work life balance and give great benefits/vacation. The work has a global impact and the scale of the company is massive. They tend to have the smartest people working there.,"Very little authority to execute projects because of the influence-based culture. Consensus has to be reached before anything can get done, and then every step of the way there are people who dissent, question, push back, etc. It is also extremely challenging to switch roles right now, especially if working for a manager with whom you don't work well."
Microsoft,4,15-Feb-24,Working environment changes with whoever is running the show,Support Escalation Manager,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Irving, TX",Great pay and benefits. Opportunities to grow career at various global locations.,Inconsistent management styles in some departments lead to a toxic work environment.
Microsoft,5,7-Nov-23,Microsoft Recruiter,Technical Recruiter,"Former Employee, more than 10 years","Seattle, WA","Windows Operating System: Microsoft's Windows OS is widely used globally due to its user-friendly interface and compatibility with a vast array of software and hardware.

Good pay Good benefits If you are a good self-guided learner then you have lots of opportunities to learn and grow.,Executive leadership seems to have become disconnected from employee's needs and reality. Can easily get lost in the noise of the company. You need to always be selling yourself to show impact and value. RIFs happen and can be large numbers and your impact to the business can be ignored.
Microsoft,3,16-Feb-24,Lack of company culture ,Senior UX Researcher,Former Employee,"Seattle, WA",Still offers a lot of remote work options,Didn’t feel like it was easy to connect with the organization. First time it felt like wasn’t having fun at work

Customers tend to buy Microsoft products because this company also offers Office which is usually used in each organization.","The company is huge, so it's difficult to experience different work in a role."
Microsoft,2,9-Jan-24,"Great benefits and compensation *ZERO* Work, Life Balance",Marketing Director,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"Good team, most want to help when they can. Great benefits and compensation which is required when mental health suffers due to 7 day work week, laughable ""time off,"" and you need to leave for your own sanity.","If you're allergic to 70+ hour work weeks, don't come to Microsoft. GM's and CVP's will work you into the ground until you turn to dust and then just hire your replacement."
Microsoft,5,16-Feb-24,Highly recommend,Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Seattle, WA",A lot is traction is happening at MSFT due to AI.,"The tech layoff's, not easy to be distracted by what is happening."
Microsoft,4,10-Nov-23,Heavy Sales,Customer Success Manager (CSM),"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Minneapolis, MN","Microsoft has amazing products and services for enterprise customers, so many companies use them...creating a lot of opportunity. The culture as a strong learning mindset and encourages people to grow and try new roles, so it's always interesting and new.","Even if you're not in a sales role, you're expected to sell the latest stuff...even if your customers aren't there yet. Also, while the culture is very employee-oriented, encouraging, diverse, and focused on work life balance and wellness, it can be very stressful due to the demand to produce new sales. And they have their own internal language (and acronyms that have 12 different meanings) that takes a while to adapt to, on top of the fact that their products and features change so rapidly (including their product names) it's almost impossible to keep up. So be aware...onboarding is like waterskiing without skis; you get dragged while hanging on for dear life."
Microsoft,5,17-Sep-23,Microsoft is what others wish to be.,Director,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","Charlotte, NC","Microsoft is a Technology company built by engineers from the ground up and designed to be run by engineers. (Gates) The company had a dark period under Ballmer, but that’s because he was not an engineer and did not fully understand how engineers think and what they respond to and it was reflected in the flat stock for more than 10 years. We now have an Engineer at the helm again in Satya Nadella and the company is back on track to continue to do great things. Pros: -Great culture -You get to work with really smart people -Decent Salary -Good work life balance -Good top level managers placing the right bets at the right times.","-The Baller years were not great -Technical training is an issue -MSFT will let you work as hard as you want so your work life balance can get out of whack. -Some people do not like the employee ranking system but that is often because its not understood, its not terrible, but the company can do a better job of explaining exactly how it works. - The RIF's are always rough but sometimes necessary"
Microsoft,5,26-Jan-24,Everything everywhere all at once!,Technical Writer,Current Employee,"Indianapolis, IN","Great senior leadership, benefits, and work flexibility.","This is not exactly a ""con,"" but is something to consider: It's a huge company that comes with a lot of complexity and various ""work cultures."" You need to be able to navigate through ambiguity at times and advocate for yourself. Working for Microsoft is not for the faint of heart."
Microsoft,2,23-Jan-24,"It's improved, but still has a long way to go",Senior Software Developer,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","Redmond, WA","The culture at Microsoft has improved since the beginning of the millenium. A lot. The elimination of stack ranking was a good move.

Healthcare coverage is excellent, as are other benefits (Perks+, flexible working location, etc.)","There is still a lot of micromanaging that hurts employee morale and creativity. Many in mid-to-upper management are still learning to shift away from the old culture.

Microsoft's pattern of regular layoffs and then hiring new people is, for lack of a better way of saying it, cruel."
Microsoft,3,3-Jan-24,"A ""safe"" job",Software Engineer II,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Seattle, WA","-Pay and benefits are ok
-Company isn't going to go belly-up anytime soon
-There are some real ""world class"" technical problems to solve","-Pay and benefits are only ok for the size of the company

Also Premera insurance does not cover weight loss Rx (GLP-1) without extensive “try other methods” for 3 months PA requirement, which many of Microsoft’s competitors policies do cover. If you read up on GLP and employer plans covering them, Microsoft’s weight loss coverage is pretty archaic (will cover bariatric surgery at $30k but not GLP-1 which studies have shown, the current generations are just as effective as bariatric without all the risks associated with surgery)"

Microsoft,2,11-Aug-23,Morale circling the drain,PM Lead,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","Redmond, WA","There are still many good things about Microsoft. The compensation is fairly high (though not the highest), and the benefits are good overall. Many of my colleagues are smart, positive, helpful people.","The phrase ""do more with less"" is once again becoming toxic at Microsoft. First, it was do more with less, because Microsoft has been laying off people right and left — many of them totally unnecessarily. The work still needs to be done, but they just cut the teams doing it. My team was cut by 60% even though there is more work than before. Then, it was do more with less compensation, when Microsoft decided not to give raises to full-time employees (during high inflation, let's call this what it is: a pay cut). The, it was do more with less as Microsoft is reducing its budget for morale, equipment, travel, vendors, everything really. WLB has gotten worse. Compensation has gotten worse. Culture has gotten worse. Morale is the lowest I've seen in over a decade. And leadership appears not to care; worse, even to be daring people to complain, daring them to leave. It's not good lately."

Tata Consultancy Services,3,6-Jan-24,Worst Management I've ever encountered ,Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Newark, NJ",It's fairly easy to pass the interviews,"They force you to look for ""Projects"" that you are hired for. Like WHAT? That should never be an employee's concern, like YOU hired ME for work, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WORK YOUR COMPANY NEEDS! If you don't find a ""project"" within one month, they'll threaten to fire you! So you are frantically having to talk to your ""regional manager"" to help you find a project or talk internally to different team managers.
Even if you are hired as a ""Java Dev"", they'll completely disregard it and try to put you on a different project with unrelated experience.
Nobody knows what's going on in management and someone tried to make me go back into the office while I was covid-compromised until it was escalated with other managers. 
They play favors to folks and overwork newer employees to the brim."

1. Pay/Benefits are not competitive with Big 4 and some boutique consulting firms.
2. Dishonest senior leadership - recent layoff was done without notice, reasonable severance, or other common courtesies.
3. Lack of Diversity - all of the executive leadership team are Indian men...it trickles down to lower levels where other demographic groups are excluded from opportunities.
4. Lack of Advancement - there's been a hiring ""freeze"" for over 4 years now.
5. Lack of Identity (Low Cost Outsourcer vs SI/Consulting Firm) - TCS is stuck in bottom line mentality... leaning on low overseas labor as their competitive advantage. This leads to a lack of vision, investment in employees, and effort to differentiate or deliver quality products.
6. Many others... too many to list."

Meta,5,17-Mar-14,"Open, fast, no bs",Software Development Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Seattle, WA","It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is, but it's true; it's more open than any other place I've worked at. At a company wide-level, secret projects, public incidents, important non-public business metrics and the like are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them directly to Zuckerburg at the weekly Q&A. I think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect. This is much different from previous companies I worked at, where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that there's certain things that can't be discussed, and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a ""need to know"" basis, etc. 

This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc. The flipside of this openness is that you of course, have to be willing to receive the feedback, you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged, decisions have to get made, and actions and data are more valuable than words. At the higher level, since the company trusts employees with access to so much information, keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously.

It's a great place to work as an engineer. You're given a lot of freedom, but it's also a responsibility to make sure you're doing things that are valuable. You don't get much credit for working hard or being smart if you don't produce valuable output.

One cool thing about Facebook, in contrast to other comparable companies (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, though in truth, FB is much smaller), is how they have a pretty singular focus. Even with the differing areas (including advertising and such), they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible. I also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for. It seems like popular opinion has it that FB is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $-signs. From within the company, it didn't feel this way at all. I saw a lot of empathy towards users, and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit. The strategy is not complex. The thinking is that if they can make FB easier and more fun to use, then more people will use it for more time each day (which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it), then the advertising dollars will follow. Of course, it is true that FB wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well, but there are a lot of people at FB who care about privacy and security.

They have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code. They have a lot of cool internal tools, and what they've built is really impressive, and more importantly, it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved. Every software company tries to do this, but FB seems to have been more successful with it. Perhaps it's because they're still relatively small, but if anything, I can at least say it is very cool while it lasts.

The perks and work environment are great, unless you're one of those types that can't stand open office spaces. I've worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies. While I do think a private office has some benefits, I mostly think it's a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company. I'd much rather have the money go into other areas like salary, benefits, and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices.

Of course, you've heard about the food and snacks. They have an amazing selection of great stuff, and what I like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations. Sure, some days, lunch is better than others, but I really can't complain, and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing. It's not like you should work at FB just because of that, but it demonstrates FB's desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible.

You'll be surrounded by people who like being there. I can't think of a better environment to work in. If you have a giant ego, you may not like it as much. Respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry, and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees. However, if for whatever reason, you can't perform at the level expected, no one is going to care if you did this and that at Google or shipped ten things at MS, etc.

FB also has a lot of fun events, and I made a lot of friends working there, so going to the events was fun. Also, if you're older and worried that FB is just a bunch of 22-year-olds, and that you won't fit in, I wouldn't worry about that. FB does have a lot of young employees (who are really smart btw), and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college, but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like Google, MS, Amazon, etc.

Work-life-balance seemed totally normal to me. It may be different depending on your team, but I felt you could do 40-50 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine. It's about what you produce, not how hard you're working. Other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times. I didn't see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that. Of course, there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens, but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly, from what I observed. Now, there were many times where I chose to work late myself, but I never felt any pressure to do so. The caveat is that there are on-call rotations, and in addition, even if you are not on-call, you are expected to be reasonably available if the on-call person needs your help. However, again, no one wants this, and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations.

The best thing I can say is that working at FB is about productivity. I didn't experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it.","FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.

FB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be applicable elsewhere.

FB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and ""get with the program"" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point. The nice thing is that things are at least very consistent."

Meta,5,16-Feb-16,Pleasantly Surprised,Site Selection Program Manager,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","I'm a 55 year old working in a company where the average age is 28, and I've never been happier. I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the ""Pros"" as I see them...

- Leadership:  Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real.
- The Culture:  The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else.
- The People:  Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere.
- Management:  Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.
- Benefits:  Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.

Granted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.","Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off. Of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance, but it's not such that 10-12 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless. We do what we do to get the job done; no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.

Being able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue."

• Work is challenging but not overwhelming, and will absolutely teach you how to excel at any Big Tech or similarly mature company
• There is a proliferation of knowledge resources, workshops, and other (actually fun) social activities","• Similar to every huge company, it's very easy to do duplicative projects, spend months on incremental changes to a single feature or project, or find that progress on your work is heavily dependent on other teams' work
• What seems to be a simple change or improvement almost always snowballs into months of tweaks and approvals; you need an preternatural sense of organization to work here sometimes
• It's very hard to work on anything truly innovative or net-new unless you're prepared to go director-level with a rock-solid case

Everything was pretty good until 2023","The leadership within the recruiting team, particularly at the director level and above, appears to lack effective decision-making and accountability. The recent wave of layoffs affecting 21,000 employees is attributed to their actions, yet there has been a concerning lack of accountability. Furthermore, the promotion of the individual leader largely responsible for the layoffs raises questions about the company's commitment to both integrity and sound decision-making.

In response to the realization that the layoffs were excessive, Meta is now rehiring recruiters, albeit on contracts without RSUs or bonuses. The recruitment strategy appears inconsistent and uninformed, as many individuals with little previous experience at Meta, including notoriously low performers, are being rehired. Furthermore, they have decided to hire many new recruiters from external sources over rehiring numerous previous Meta employees with several years of tenure and consistent high-performance ratings, which is an absolutely disgraceful practice. While some rehired recruiters are extremely deserving, the overall process has negatively impacted many talented and loyal professionals, leaving an incredible sense of resentment for a company that I once held in high regard."
Meta,1,12-Feb-24,Toxic culture obliterates any upside,Researcher,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",,"- Opportunity to work on innovative future-facing tech 

- Fair pay and amazing benefits

- A lot of great, bright people - only a few will be pleasant to work with as well because of the corporate culture (see cons) 

- Learning opportunities with education and conference benefits (though these seem to have been cut in lieu of ""efficiency"")

- Surpassed expectations for work-life balance. Though, admittedly, this wholly self-controlled. But, if you want it, you can have it.","- Lack of trust - among the people you work with and upwards towards leadership 

- Lack of vision - typically product evolution includes both a business and a user perspective. Here you might get ""[Name] says we need to ______"" or ""We already promised [Name] to do ________"" without a lot of rationale or data to support anything. There was *one* business leader that explicitly called out this use of their name and said it wasn't an acceptable excuse to developing product in undesirable ways. Most leaders will relish in their ""influence"" at the expense of efficient, human-centered product development

- Managers, if you have one, are generally useless but protected by the managers above them. All are incentivized by growing their teams, regardless of if it makes sense for the business. 

- News and company perceptions can weigh heavily on you 

- Prides itself on operating as a startup still, but it's nearly impossible at meta's scale to operate like this. Siloing and duplicative efforts of people desperate to prove their impact are the norm. 

- Likability is a currency for success. Paradoxically, the performance system encourages a 'dog eat dog' environment of overachieving ICs riddled with fear and insecurity as they try to prove why they're better than everybody around them thereby killing any chance of community. Note, it's not really the ICs fault this fear-culture flourishes. No matter what the company states, there is a performance curve - and no matter how amazing the talent, a certain percent of people will have to fall below the line as not meeting expectations and getting performance plans to shove them out the door and meet quotas 

- Researchers can expect an expectation matrix of about 1200 bullet points and 5 different job descriptions in one. Many managers are not shy about saying they use these bullet points like a checklist to figure out where you're lacking. (A tangential aside - while your performance success is highly contingent upon your ability to influence, no other functions will have performance matrixes that require them to work effectively with research) 

- Lack of follow through and commitment to employee experience and well-being. You will be asked to provide feedback on the company, re-assured of why you are so important to the company, etc. but 1) feedback is rarely acted on (though you will have to participate in biannual ideations for leadership so they can solve their own problems - and after you've wasted time on that, nothing will change and you'll do it again in 6 months) and 2) when the tides turn, you'll realize your input, feedback and value are essentially null and they won't hesitate to cut the cog out of the machine. It's business. And they'll likely provide enough threat (additional employee cuts or harsh policies) or incentive (extra bonuses) to make everybody else forget about that time they threw their employees under the bus."

This aspect of the job is genuinely exciting and provides a great learning opportunity for anyone passionate about the future of tech. Comp, benefits and perks are great.","Unfortunately, the experience is significantly marred by poor leadership and senior management. There is a noticeable lack of solid direction or a coherent point of view, which makes strategic planning and execution very challenging. No one wants to make a decision here. Major group think issues largely due to poor leadership POV. 

The approach to decision-making is not data-driven, often seeming haphazard or impulsive. This ""shooting from the hip"" style contributes to a sense of uncertainty and inefficiency within the team.
A significant concern is the inability of leadership to make decisive and timely decisions. This indecisiveness not only hampers progress but also contributes to a frustrating work environment.

There is a widespread (justifiable) lack of respect for the marketing leadership of Reality Labs across various departments, from marketing, strategy, and creative. I think about 80% of the colleagues have openly voiced their concerns. It's actually alarming. This lack of respect is alarming and raises questions about the sustainability of current leadership. I never worked somewhere where it's more obvious and openly out there that the leadership is NAF. 

The choice to collaborate with BBDO as an agency partner has been a controversial move, casting doubts on the upper management's decision-making capabilities—and is emblematic of the leadership's misjudgments and disconnect from industry standards.

The overarching issue seems to be a disconnect between the Reality Labs org and the practical realities of the market and our audience. It's concerning how out of touch the leadership appears, prompting serious questions about the Meta's Marketing direction and vision for Reality Labs."

My only ratings at Meta were 'meets all' or above and I was pushed out by my out-of-touch manager because he needed a few people off of his team to meet quota. The culture has devolved into people being so afraid of getting laid off that they work around the clock (ex. 1: My PM team all talked about how they worked until midnight every day ex 2: One of my coworkers cut her maternity leave for her first kid short by two months so that she could be around for end of year reviews and next year planning) and backstabbing - no critical feedback is ever delivered to you, it is only ever 'back channeled' to your management chain so that it can be used against you in reviews.

Meta,5,1-May-15,Landslide win over Google for career growth,Software Engineer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Menlo Park, CA","I just left Google and joined Facebook, and felt so much happier. The reasons are:

1. The real impact
At Google I joined a team whose product is only used by less than 1000 people, and even for that product I was assigned to do a peripheral part, whose functionality actually doesn't matter at all. Just for that module, I had to write unit test for every silly part of the code, and took long iteration cycles. I admit those are good engineering coding trainings, however taking precious time in my life to work on something that doesn't matter is just a waste of my life.

In Facebook things just move so much faster. There are standard software engineering review process but not as rigid. Just during training (boot camp) weeks, I had tasks to change very important part of Facebook's core code, and the second day after I check-in my code, it got shipped to almost 1 billion people. As a software engineer I cannot recall a moment I felt better for my job.

Then I joined a team that's extremely important to Facebook's revenue. A mistake in the code I changed could cause Facebook million dollar a day. However Facebook just trusted us, allowed us making mistake and having quick iteration cycles to test ideas fast. If I make a coding mistake in my team in Google it might cost Google nothing in terms of revenue as my product was small, however the development process was so strict I could not have chance to try my innovations or test my ideas. But in Facebook that's all possible.

2. The organizational structure
Google's organization is now very structured and hierarchical. Facebook is having more layers, but the working style is still flat, and social-network style. Speaking to people in different teams, form an idea, lead a virtual team and complete it, this style is still valued. My boss is more like a mentor helping me navigating through the ideas, rather than an authority telling me what to do.","1. I don't quite like the office decoration style. A little bit stressful and factory like.
2. The compensation is better than Google but not as good as other smaller companies.

Hiring manager seemed excellent, direct colleagues were mostly collaborative and kind. Some high quality talent, and leading research in many top fields.","Part of the November 2022 layoffs, Meta recruited me from a role I enjoyed so I was essentially ""hired to fire"", morale was absolutely horrendous with ample signs of project hoarding out of fear, territoriality, and overall gloominess, the number of management layers (back then) was almost comical, including Director-level middle managers of very questionable experience (e.g. Director A with background in politics and no tech experience acting like the stereotypical ""I'm type A""-tough, Director B who was key for specific projects yet acted like their calendar was presidential-grade and never showed up, etc.).

There is a complete lack of transparency and everything can change on a dime, which it makes it difficult to have stability in your own life, which thus makes all the 'perks' that bit more redundant.

It is a highly political environment, in the sense that it is more important who you know, than how you perform your work. The performance review was a jock, with senior management getting into the tool and changing performance ratings without even knowing who the employee is. Meta  terminated 21,000.

Meta,5,1-May-15,Landslide win over Google for career growth,Software Engineer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Menlo Park, CA","I just left Google and joined Facebook, and felt so much happier. The reasons are:

1. The real impact
At Google I joined a team whose product is only used by less than 1000 people, and even for that product I was assigned to do a peripheral part, whose functionality actually doesn't matter at all. Just for that module, I had to write unit test for every silly part of the code, and took long iteration cycles. I admit those are good engineering coding trainings, however taking precious time in my life to work on something that doesn't matter is just a waste of my life.

In Facebook things just move so much faster. There are standard software engineering review process but not as rigid. Just during training (boot camp) weeks, I had tasks to change very important part of Facebook's core code, and the second day after I check-in my code, it got shipped to almost 1 billion people. As a software engineer I cannot recall a moment I felt better for my job.

Then I joined a team that's extremely important to Facebook's revenue. A mistake in the code I changed could cause Facebook million dollar a day. However Facebook just trusted us, allowed us making mistake and having quick iteration cycles to test ideas fast. If I make a coding mistake in my team in Google it might cost Google nothing in terms of revenue as my product was small, however the development process was so strict I could not have chance to try my innovations or test my ideas. But in Facebook that's all possible.

2. The organizational structure
Google's organization is now very structured and hierarchical. Facebook is having more layers, but the working style is still flat, and social-network style. Speaking to people in different teams, form an idea, lead a virtual team and complete it, this style is still valued. My boss is more like a mentor helping me navigating through the ideas, rather than an authority telling me what to do.","1. I don't quite like the office decoration style. A little bit stressful and factory like.
2. The compensation is better than Google but not as good as other smaller companies.
3. Despite good acquisitions for solidify the position in social media, social networks, there is still uncertainty about the future of this company."

Some people create projects to serve their own purpose and pressure everyone else to meet their targets. Sometimes people would create a large project and leave for better offer. It can be very chaotic. This company does not seem to value running a smooth operation, they expect everyone to perform like a unicorn. 'Meets all expectations' somehow is not good enough, everyone is striving for 'Exceed' ' Greatly Exceed' or 'Redefined'. It can be very exhausting and disingenuous.

No longer were you acknowledged for the amazing work you do or the teams you are building from the ground up, but based off of who on the VP team likes you. You were praised for how much noise you made VS the actual work you were able to accomplish. ""Year of efficiency"" and focusing on ""impact"" means that important work was either being cancelled or forcibly distributed amongst other teams.

One good thing is if you are a recent graduate here you can get some experience granted they find a decent project for you. Get ready to lie. Yes lie! Infosys’s managers will ask you to bump up your experience, even if you have none, just so they could charge clients more for your spot.","Does not matter how hard you work your work will not be appreciated. Yes you will get a pat on your back but that’s it. Does not matter if you spend extra time after work hours, does not matter if the client is super happy with you and keeps sending emails to Infosys praising your work. None of it matters you will only get your standard 1.5 or 3% increase. Which to most people will be around 1700-1800$
 Actually if you do good and client is happy with you Infosys will charge the client more after first 6month and they will keep increasing charge without rewarding you.
They typically charge 3 to 4 times of what they pay you. Yes you are reading it right. Infosys will pay you around 30$ per hour BUT will charge clients 90-120$ bucks per hour per one fresher and then at the end of the year they will give you 0.45 cents increase.

- Uncertain living expectations; depending on contracts you may be expected to move anywhere within the country within days, and you will need to pay for this upfront. Be sure to keep all receipts as they are terrible about reimbursing for things that they do not have multiple proof of purchase artifacts for. They also have limits to how much they reimburse which you have to find on your own.
- They do not help very much with career advancement. They have certain classes you can take that give you badges, but these classes often feel like a waste of time as much of what you need to learn on a job is gained through experience.

Infosys,2,9-Feb-24,The worst communication,Consultant,Current Employee,,"Paid on time, job is secure due to high turnover.  Managers are flexible with time off.","Leadership with no leadership or soft skills. Managers do not want you to go to them but that ypu like crap if you go above them. Nothing is communicated but team is expected to know the things that are not communicated. No written processes or good on boarding or training plans. Low to no raises, no bonuses. Required to pay for things and told I'd get reimbursed and no reimbursement. You're required to contact someone in India for laptop issues. It took 38 calls and over a week to get a resolution. Huge headache."
Infosys,5,1-Jan-24,Overview experience,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Bengaluru,"Pros of Infosys working culture include a strong emphasis on learning and development, a global work environment, and opportunities for career growth. Cons may involve high workload at times and challenges related to maintaining work-life balance. It’s essential to consider individual preferences and priorities when evaluating the overall fit with Infosys’ culture.","Cons of Infosys working culture may include occasional high-pressure work situations, a fast-paced environment that might not suit everyone, and the need to adapt to frequent changes in project assignments. Some employees may also find the hierarchical structure challenging. It's crucial to assess these aspects based on personal preferences and career goals."

Infosys,5,15-Oct-23,infosys pros and cons,System Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Pune,"Global Presence: Infosys has a widespread global presence, with offices and development centers in several countries. This global footprint allows them to serve clients from various regions. Reputation: Infosys has a strong reputation in the IT industry for delivering quality services and innovative solutions. Their track record often attracts large enterprises. Talent Pool: The company hires some of the best talents in the industry, ensuring that clients have access to skilled professionals and experts in various domains. Diverse Services: Infosys offers a wide range of services, including IT consulting, software development, maintenance, and outsourcing services. This diversity allows them to cater to different client needs.","Price: Being a prominent IT company, Infosys' services can be relatively expensive for smaller businesses or startups. Cost-effectiveness might be a concern for some clients. Dependency on H-1B Visas: Infosys, like many other Indian IT companies, heavily relies on H-1B visas to bring skilled workers to the United States. Changes in visa regulations can impact their workforce and operations. Workload and Employee Pressure: There have been reports of high-pressure work environments and long working hours in some Infosys offices, which can lead to employee burnout and dissatisfaction. Competitive Market: The IT industry is highly competitive, and Infosys faces stiff competition from other global IT giants. Adapting to market trends and staying ahead of the competition is a constant challenge."

Oracle,5,2-Jan-24,Excellent Learning Opportunities,Principal Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Raleigh, NC","Oracle offers great opportunities for learning new skills. Tuition reimbursement assists with higher education costs outside of the company. Internally, employees have access to a multitude of training modules. Work-life balance is important to the culture.",Moving to another department generally requires approval from your current manager.
Oracle,4,21-Oct-14,"Great benefits, good people, slow innovation, no raises",Technical Analyst III (Support),"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Denver, CO","Every group/division can be different in how they treat their employees, but I'd say overall there is very good atmosphere of trust and fairness. There is a strong focus on education, and they reimburse for outside classes taken (Up to 5k/year I think). Benefits are good, and I'd say quite competitive in the market. Good 401K matching (they'll contribute a max of 3% of your 6% or greater). Free drinks in the breakroom. Flexibility to work from home at times. (If you live 50+ miles away from an office you can work full-time from home...policy).","They don't try to make the workplace anything special (maybe a pool table and arcade game are cliche or gimmicky?). In the 10 years I've worked there, they've given 2 measly %1 cost of living raises (this is the same with most everyone I've spoken to, some don't get any raises). You will not get a substantial raise ever, unless you leave then get rehired on (they will not match offers, better to leave). New employees that you train will make 10 - 20K more than you several years after you hire on (not just me, they do this to all tenured employees). They will give these untrained, less experienced people higher titles (again this is done to everyone not just me). You learn pretty quickly that you're dispensable. The company has billions in cash and they don't re-invest in their employees, just in acquiring new companies and hiring new people that know nothing that you get to train."

OCI and Apps","Old guard is the weakest link if they have never left to experience other companies’ culture, management styles, and returned to Oracle. 

HR empowers and protects short-sighted, insecure, transactional Toxic Management at the cost of sales flight risk and long term customer satisfaction 

Senior Management P & P are inconsistent and transactional. They are not monitored by Sales Excellence for consistency in Oracle culture, communication, and team KPIs. 

Constant layoffs and reorgs

Quarter close is transactional; steamroll 

Customers are valued as a transaction not as a strategic investment 

ASMs are constantly rotated through accounts 

Tenured employees are intentionally paid low base salaries unless they leave Oracle and return 

Cutthroat culture: no trust among multiple product lines, Cloud, ASMs, BDRs, and cross product leadership

Club is held in Vegas immediately before Vegas-based Users Conference. Many multi -year club winner ASMs and many Sales leaders are boycotting it, since Oracle post COVID is refusing to properly invest in a Tier 1 Club nor to pay for “significant others” to attend. 

Quotas don’t take into consideration that in some industries, Customers are fed up with siloed cutthroat Oracle go-to-market. Many legacy customers are instructed by procurement to go out to bid for lower cost options, supported by customer-friendly account management and value-based commercial terms."

Make sure your managers love you and you will be loved back. When the stress from upper mgt trickles down to you, just say ""you're right and thank you for pointing that out"". it's that kinda org...","Mess up? prepare for hell and daily threats of getting fired with reminders of how useless you are. Their training programs are ineffective, you only learn from yourself or your peers, you have to pave your own way. 
It doesn't get any more traditional in terms of climbing up the ladder here, You have to keep a bragging report of your achievements, and network your way in. And people have to like you to get promoted, your numbers are not enough.. people with less achievements have gotten early promos that don't make sense. Stress is insane here.. you can see fear in your manager's eyes and tone... Your managers will tell you one thing and deny it the second their upper manager tells them otherwise because everyone is THAT afraid to make a mistake here. Employee Morale is continuously surprising us how low it can go, Goooooooooooood luck :)
Also forget bout taking holidays because you'll need the numbers to prove it & even if you're fine.. you'll be terrified about how to compensate the days 'wasted' on rest."
Oracle,3,30-Jan-24,This company will slowly take advantage of you as your career stalls and workload increases,Business Analyst,Current Employee,"Austin, TX","Good pay, many of our support teams are remote, and you don't need much tech knowledge. Aside from Excel, most of our tools are built and developed in-house, so you don't need a degree in IT or coding knowledge to work as a business analyst with finance and sales data","It's a well known ""secret"" that the only way to get a pay increase is to leave the company, then get rehired for the same role as an ""outside hire."" This is mind-boggling and leads to a massive brain drain throughout the year. One reason for this is because bonuses and raises are not a thing; you do not have a performance review and there are no career milestones to work towards (leading to, effectively, a dead-end job). Finally, most operation teams are seriously overworked. This is caused by people leaving (probably to seek more pay) and management ""temporarily"" giving their workload to someone else on the team while they ""find a replacement."" This never happens; I know some teams that shrank from 10 to 6 analysts and stayed like that for years. And no, we do not get more pay with these increased workloads (trust me, I've asked)"
Oracle,2,2-Feb-24,Average Big Tech Experience,Principal Program Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Washington, DC","Depending on which line of business you work in, you might get unlimited PTO. Which makes the North American winter break period a plus instead of a minus.

Benefits are decent, with notable extras like gympass. And a decent amount set aside for training. 

Employee Resource Groups are an excellent way to network and meet other colleagues in the MNC.","Oracle has a tendency to buy up everything and just hope for the best when it comes to integrating those new companies into the new parent company. What you end up with is a hodge podge of fragmented businesses that don't know how to work together.

Also, Oracle loves doing silent layoffs to keep out of the news. So they cut just enough to not activate the WARN Act -- usually right before a quarterly earnings call or during the beginning of a new fiscal year. If you work here, always keep your resume updated."
Oracle,5,14-Feb-24,Love This Company,Contract Administrator,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","San Antonio, TX","Working at Oracle provides a unique and positive experience due to its hybrid model. This approach allows employees the flexibility to balance work and life effectively, fostering a healthier work environment. The unlimited sick time policy demonstrates a commitment to employee well-being, ensuring individuals can prioritize their health without added stress. Moreover, the culture of treating employees like adults creates a sense of autonomy, promoting a collaborative and respectful atmosphere. Overall, these factors contribute to a workplace that values work-life balance, health, and a mature approach to professional relationships.",The only downside of the hybrid model is having to come into the office twice a week. The volume of work can get overwhelming at times due to complexity and dollar value. Quarter end months tend to be extremely busy and can leave you feeling completely drained.
Oracle,3,16-Feb-24,"Terrible management, terrible compensation",Senior Principal Consultant,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,The benefit package offered was good. There was an opportunity to learn a lot and develop skills.,"Coworkers who had less experience were hired in at higher rates. When I tried to negotiate based on this knowledge, I was not offered anything better. The consulting practice manager would brag about his bonuses and how he was able to order fancy cars, high end watches, and build additions onto his home. It was completely inequitable.

Opportunity to learn about excellent but very complex products. Great resume entry. Good insurance and stock buys options. Oracle used to have the philosophy, “Find all your smartest friends and get them to come work here.”, but I haven’t heard anyone say that in more than a decade.","In the 15+ years I was there, most of the time we had headcount and salary freezes. I started as a trainee, but despite more than qualifying was never given promised non-trainee status and $25k raise because of constant freezes. Getting re-hired for an open position took eight months because of freezes. To get a promotion I had to leave the company for a few years. The team I came back to never saw raises, not even COLA, and our team was paid noticeably under professional averages. I had some great managers, very admirable, who also weren’t getting raises. Constant posturing and direction changes for Wall Street but not much substance support. Frequent layoffs so no one felt secure. Toward the end of my tenure they removed support for a large percentage of paying customers who didn’t want to move to the Cloud (often for very good reasons). Oracle will take all of your time if you let it - it’s up to you to draw life boundaries and hope your manager will support you. It used to be a much more diverse place, but once the post-1990’s layoffs started it’s become whiter and more male."

Oracle,2,8-Feb-24,"NetSuite - Decent Compensation, Highly Questionable Culture",Emerging Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"Excellent introductory sales training, accessible leadership, young energetic workforce, lots of company networking events, multiple offices, strong compensation plan. You can make a lot of money at this job, just be prepared to work extremely hard as an account executive.","There are a few things that really soured my experience working at this company.


Territories are wide open and NetSuite places hundreds of reps in a free for all in each territory. This breeds a cut throat culture amongst the reps. If you take this role you will be subject to reps trying to steal leads that fall out of your name. If you are an outside hire you are at an immediate disadvantage as internal promotes have had years of practice within the CRM already and are akin to taking leads from their peers and finding ways to funnel new leads away from other reps just to themselves. 

Which brings up another part of the job that really brought down my motivation. Top performing reps in recent time figured out ways to funnel hot inbound leads away from our inbound queue that is supposed to fairly distribute each of these leads as they come in and had them only funneled to themselves. Either by creating searches to get in front of these leads unfairly before they were distributed or getting an assigned BDR to do it for them under the table. 

It was revealed that all of our top performing reps had been practicing this. Which lead to around 10 or so reps per region closing all the large inbound deals leaving the rest to fend for themselves and scrape up anything they can. 

Finally, only around 20% of the entire sales team hit quota last year, partly due to top reps gaming the CRM system and funneling every single good inbound lead to themselves. 

Leadership fully ignored this and instead of punishing those reps in question, gave them a slap on the wrist and promoted them. 

NetSuite is a sink or swim company with surface level ""nice guy"" corporate behavior to mask the deeply negative leadership backroom politics that take place. Favoritism, lead sniping and inbound engagement malpractice run rampant. 

I guess this can come with being such a large company. After the Oracle purchase NetSuite really evolved from a cool start up type company to a corporate beast where you're more focused on infighting with your co-workers than actually closing business with prospects on the outside. 

On top of they have an extremely keen focus on tracking metrics and micromanaging your day to day. There were leaders who were 2-3 levels above managers looking at reps day to day performances. Also, you're ability to move within the company is currently very limited. You can apply to 10+ roles within oracles opportunity market and not get a single chance to interview even if you personally reach out to the hiring managers. 

Be cautious when accepting a role here. It's a smile at your face while stabbing you in the back culture grindfest and it will not be fixed any time soon."
Oracle,2,9-Jan-24,"Good potential, falls way short",BDR,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"Great coworkers in the BDR program, and good training. All the benefits that come with the job and great as well.","BDR management is awful. The entire process of working here has been frustrating. Even if you hit your quotas, serve over your supposed tenure, and overachieve in qualifying / bringing in new business, it won’t help you get promoted. Leadership plays favorites from what was once a “promote everyone” mindset. They over hired unqualified people, and now that sales are down (due to a combination of external factors as well), the rest of the BDR organization has to suffer. BDRs are deceived into thinking they still have a chance at promotion before getting handed an excuse that there were only 2 spots that went to more unqualified leadership favorites (this happened pretty much monthly). I’d rather have committed to a different program if I had known how unreliable NetSuite was."

I was promoted quickly from a BDC to Inside Sales Rep. There are some great leaders in the company who truly care about others and their success. World class sales training program and plenty of good people. The 12 week training is perfect for those shifting from college into the workforce.","I worked in the public sector organization. The women on the team made $19000 less base salary than the men on the team. ($52500 versus $71000 approx). Total commission 2-3% on deals worth from $1-$250000). With other factors such as tenure, experience, and average age of the team considered, I still found this to be a striking difference in pay. Another note, Oracle always will pay a higher base to those hired externally at the Inside Sales level and up (about 15-20%). Also, the products/services don’t always work."

Meaning that if you don’t work there for at least 4 years, Oracle is entitled to take back a majority of their matched contributions to your 401k. They made sure to emphasize the company matching % all throughout the hiring/onboarding process, but did not put the same energy into emphasizing that you only get to keep it all if you work there for 4 years. It just rubbed me the wrong way a little. Since this is many people’s first job out of college, many if not all of my former coworkers that I talked to were unaware of this."

Oracle,1,17-Oct-23,Stay far away!,Customer Support Technician,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,Offers the typical corporate benefits that all other companies offer. Nothing special.,"Leadership: The leadership at my site, Baptist Health, is the worst I've ever witnessed in my long IT career. Decisions are based on C-suite knee-jerk reactions to minor incidents with total disregard for any other high-priority projects. This causes much frustration and confusion for the teams that actually do the work and do not sit in meetings all day. Pay: The pay is insulting and way below par for the work performed and the industry. Unless you are in a ""leadership"" position. Also, there isn't a pay raise in sight. Opportunity: There is no training provided for any current role and they seem to only hire from the outside versus hiring those ready to move up in the company. If you are lucky enough to obtain a position internally, you will not receive a pay raise of any sort. Communication: Each day is served with several fire alarms because nobody communicates regardless of all of the meetings about meetings.

The role in micron is my first full time job after college. And I have felt challenged at work along with at peace at mind. Micron has given me several opportunities to showcase what I can bring to the table and to the big picture, along with providing me necessary feedbacks and pats on the back whenever necessary. The availability of the variety of challenges I can take on, the youthful peer group and workforce, senior managers and directors always there for doubt clarification and guidance, all have added to my very good first 6 months here.","For someone who wants to escalate quickly through the ranks of corporate world, Micron might be a little slowpaced.

You've been warned,Yield Enhancement Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Manassas, VA",You get paid every 2 weeks and may learn a thing or two about semiconductors. That's the only pro you get working here.,"The culture is EXTREMELY TOXIC with ass-licking coworkers and micromanagement to the highest level. Plus layoffs now and then.

Coworkers can't communicate to save their lives but are constantly in your business and gossip a lot. They would rather go to your boss about an issue that involves you than come to you directly to discuss it. So Childish! Everyone is out for themselves to get promoted (which rarely happens) and will find a scapegoat to bully for that. 

Diversity? lol. They purposely hire a bunch of foreigners hoping to trap them with sponsorship and will delay it to keep them stuck due to high turnover. lmao. 

The cafeteria food sucks. The interior of the building is so old, it's depressing going to work. The tools at YE break down constantly and they ship down old used tools from other micron sites to replace them. A company worth billions can't even afford a microscope, it's hilarious LOL. Your 12-hour shifts will be spent waiting on a broken tool that can't take clear images. And they'll make you feel like micron is all you have and that you won't be able to get any opportunities elsewhere. YOU WILL!

The best thing I did was leave quickly and take a better opportunity elsewhere. I get good benefits, work-life balance, AMAZING coworkers, and higher pay at my new job. 

For new grads, take it, stay a year or two, and get the hell out!"

Stable job.","I did not think Micron will have cons, but comparing to Infineon and Globalfoundaries which are also in downturn and doing badly, Micron has developed many cons in last 2 years
1. Salary is VERY low compared to market. 
2. Micron prefers fresh hires and don't adjust salary compared to youngsters or Fresh Hires. This pay revision cycle I got 3% raise compared to my junior who got 9% raise. Both of us no promotion and but of us high rating of 4. So you can see clear differentiation. 
3. No OT allowed to enter, even if you work extra hours. No time-off and no compensation of any kind. 
4. No Micron points (Bravo) anymore. So if you collaborate with other teams, the maximum you will get is a stupid email of appreciation. No spot bonus also. 
5. Biggest issue of all: no FAIR promotion. The people who get promoted are those have HIGH visibility and those who impress bosses. Cliche roles like automation which do not see immediate gains, will be ignored."

SAP,3,22-Jan-24,Leadership is failing its employees in 2024,Director,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",,"Over 10 years at SAP and I have found my colleagues to be incredibly smart and dedicated. The work is fascinating. Up until this year, I would have also (and have) said top leadership generally strives to take care of its employees as much as it can though that is no longer the case, sadly.","The executive leadership has completely disconnected itself from the reality of the post-COVID workspace. They lost all compassion for employees and now follow their own desires and feelings of how work ""should be"" rather than considering actual data when it comes to making decisions that affect the lives of their employees and their work productivity. They have abandoned SAP's sustainability goals. They have abandoned SAP's D&I goals."
SAP,1,10-Jan-24,Betrayal at SAP,Sales Advisor,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",,"I've loved SAP for the last 15 years. They typically do a great job with DEI, purpose, health and wellness, etc.","The SAP Executive Board betrayed its 100,000+ employees on January 9th, 2024, at 12:02 Pacific Time. We received a notification that employees must work in the office three days per week even though we have been a remote culture for at least 15 years. 

Most employees at SAP joined, at least in part, because we had a remote culture. For many years, our LOBs actively supported remote work. We've never discriminated against WFH employees. We had a remote work culture before COVID, and it was critical to the ease with which we navigated the pandemic. Nobody expected the executive board to betray our culture and people like this.

Realistically, I suspect this is all an attempt for SAP to avoid laying people off two years in a row. If they institute a 3-day-in-office policy, they darn well know that a significant percentage of its population will quit. What a shame. I'll probably be amongst them if this policy goes into effect for real in May.

Workday and Oracle Recruiters, get ready! You'll have your pick of the litter as soon as this policy goes into effect. Many of us will probably jump sooner.

SAP, prepare for the brain drain. What a shame. I loved this company."

- if you’re in the first 10 years of your career there is tremendous opportunity to move into different types of roles
- when layoffs happen (inevitable in tech) they’re very supportive to affected people and include transition assistance","- re-orgs every year
- if you love your role it could change even if you don’t want it to

- there is no CRM or knowledge of accounts - it’s excel.
- there is no strategy regarding territory assignments
- they have eliminated spiffs and accelerators
- the culture has gone from okay to terrible
- customers are being bludgeoned to select RISE erp even when not a fit and the company has truly only released only smoke and mirrors innovation since 2020."
SAP,4,31-Jan-24,Nice place to work,Product Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Palo Alto, CA","Working at SAP offers numerous advantages, including its global presence, commitment to innovation and technology, and a diverse and inclusive workforce. Employees benefit from career development opportunities, comprehensive benefits, and a strong emphasis on work-life balance. SAP's corporate social responsibility initiatives contribute to a positive impact on communities and the environment. The company fosters an inclusive culture that values the contributions of all employees and promotes collaboration. SAP's recognition and rewards programs, continuous learning culture, and innovative workspaces further contribute to a positive and fulfilling work environment.","Cons of SAP may include complexity in implementation, high costs for small businesses, potential for system customizations, a steep learning curve, and occasional challenges in customer support responsiveness."

SAP,2,12-Jan-24,"Used to be awesome, seems to be going dowhill fast",Senior Consultant,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","New York, NY","My colleagues and managers. Most SAP employees are incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, and fun to be around. Worklife balance historically has also been pretty good. Although I fear that with recent changes, the culture will change for the worse.","Recently released a sweeping mandate requiring ALL employees globally to be in-office 3 days per week. Will be implementing a stricter performance review policy, and they effectively eliminated our employee appreciation tool. Feels like the company is regressing to an ""old-school"" culture, as they are doing away with everything that made SAP a great place to work. The historically very positive culture is deteriorating fast, and morale is low."
SAP,2,30-Jan-24,Change is needed in the sales org,Sr Sales Executive,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,Large company with a significant amount of internal support for the sales org. The benefits are very good in my opinion as well. Sr leadership has a decent vision of where the company is going and needs to get to. SAP hods a high amount of dominance in the ERP space globally. The partner network int he US and globally is very strong as well with a lot of options and niches available to the diverse portfolio of companies who use SAP products.,"Sales mgmt needs a complete overhaul. It's still very much a ""boys club"" with an extreme amount of corporate politics. The goals are unrealistic, yet the company still shows it's making their number. This is due to the company placing a higher quota on the sales org than the companies anticipated financial performance. There is a significant gap in the ""haves and have nots"" amongst sakes reps. 
Not all territories are created equal by a long shot. It takes a long time to build up a pipeline and close deals. If you are not making your number or very close to it within a year, you WILL be managed out, even if you're on the uptick. Managers will remove s significant number of reps on their team and the company will not even consider looking at the leadership qualities / styles of its sales management. Lastly, the training is lacking. The expectation is what I would call, trial by fire. In my first year, I wasn't shown a demo of the core product itself. The HR department is negligent at best. HR complaints almost always side with the company even though they boast of policies in place to support and protect employees. Extremely hypocritical. I've witnessed numerous cases of this in my 5+ years with SAP. Lastly, you're expected to work 40+ hours consistently. I was told numerous times since I've been here...this is NOT a 40 hour a week job, period."" There is little to no life balance, but yet we are told this is ""being worked on"" at Sr leadership levels. Certainly NOT in the sales org."

Dell is known for its commitment to technological advancement, and this role allows professionals to actively contribute to groundbreaking ideas and solutions.

Cross-Functional Collaboration: Working closely with cross-functional teams, including engineers, designers, marketers, and researchers, fosters a diverse and dynamic work environment. This collaboration encourages the exchange of ideas and perspectives, leading to well-rounded product development.

Career Growth: Dell offers excellent opportunities for career growth and professional development. As a Product Innovation Specialist, you have the chance to gain expertise in cutting-edge technologies and play a crucial role in shaping the company's future direction.

Impactful Work: The role provides a sense of purpose, as professionals in this position have a direct impact on the products Dell delivers to customers. Bringing innovative solutions to market can be highly rewarding, knowing that your contributions enhance the lives of technology users.","High Expectations: With a focus on innovation comes high expectations. Pressure to constantly generate novel ideas and solutions can be demanding, and the need to meet ambitious targets may lead to stressful situations.

Uncertainty: The tech industry is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. This can lead to uncertainty in the market, which may affect job stability, especially if innovative projects face unexpected challenges or market shifts.

Work-Life Balance: In the pursuit of innovation, professionals in this role may sometimes need to work long hours or deal with tight deadlines. Maintaining a healthy work-life balance can be challenging during particularly intense project phases.

Resource Constraints: Innovation often requires substantial resources, and there may be constraints in terms of budgets, time, or available talent. Finding creative solutions within these constraints can be a demanding aspect of the job."

- The work from a software engineering point of view is probably the worst thing about the company. Depending on team, like the one I'm on, the tasks and features are so basic and require such little engineering skills that you become worse as a developer. This is a big problem that many have come to realise and for someone starting out in their career can be damaging when you want to soak up as much skills as possible. You just won't get that here!
- IT constantly make changes and updates which block you from doing work and can take weeks to sort out.
- Principle devs have a habit of pushing un-reviewed and untested code which causes so many problems. Literally weeks are lost each year because of this.

Some leadership is cool and will listen but for the most part, your manager cant' save you.

The senior VP constantly brags about how much money he makes and all of the vacations he takes while the rest of us are barely scraping by to pay our rent. According to him we are the ones to blame for the state of the company, not the fact that their constant bad policy updates and high turnover rates make it impossible to move up and succeed. It is an absolute miracle if you make it through your first year at Dell. Don't expect to make money either, even if you over attain your unrealistic quota you're making 60k at best.

This is the company when they need to cut the cost they remove all their technical people first and those who are not licking boots they will be first to let go. In my last 12 years never saw any Sr. Dir or Dir's asked to let go. Most Org's have incompetent resources and they are just there to conduct meetings. Most Senior Architects are there to take credit of Junior Resources. The year 2024 Buzzword is AI and GenerativeAI and all Directors and Sr. Dir's keep taking the same buzz words in every call and after 1-2 year everyone start talking about some other things.

In addition, there is clear favoritism/outright fudging of numbers and cheating that almost everyone participates in to meet their assigned metrics. Very low lead count with many being terrible and outdated leads. Other red flags include Dell being so pro-remote only to take that away this year even though sales peaked in COVID, required work outings, and more that I'm sure I'm missing.

I am an experienced executive with several years in my professional career and I can say with confidence that this is the most negative experience of my career. 

Capgemini is incredibly dysfunctional which I attribute to its size and quality of its leaders. Everyone is incredibly uncollaborative, unsupportive, and outright unprofessional. Don't expect any meaningful onboarding, you are expected to just ""figure it out"". Once you do have a few months under your belt, collaborating with anyone is incredibly challenging. No one is motivated to work with one another, no one returns emails and phone calls, and leadership models this negative behavior on a consistent basis. 

Beyond this, Capgemini is predominantly South Asian (I would venture to say over 90%). As such, if you are not a part of that clique it will be difficult to be treated with respect and given equal treatment. If you are a more junior employee, you will be treated like one. Your perspectives and experience will not be valued. More so, you will have client access restricted and skipped over for opportunities. I observed this to be even more severe for females."

It’s goes beyond just unpleasantness and being “toxic.” I wish I had spoken to an employment lawyer during my time at Cap. The project leads are usually narcissists who have no qualms about lying to your face and making you responsible for their mistakes.

They will lie and tell you that you gain increase in pay upon positive annual review... What they don't tell you is that even if you do get a good annual review there's no guarantee you get pay raise... might as well expect it to simply not happen unless you get promoted instead... but to what when there's no roles available to get promoted to?

Salesforce,4,9-Jul-14,"Still a lot of opportunity to learn, connect, and chart your own course, but Big Company culture is encroaching.",Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","San Francisco, CA","I've spent over 8 years with Salesforce in various management and individual contributor roles, all customer or partner facing. Some of the pros:
- vibrant, fast paced culture 
- smart, fun, aggressive colleagues
- management is focused on latest tech trends and staying or becoming a leader for many of them
- by and large, customers and partners are very positive about the technology
- good benefits and perqs
- hip urban culture at HQ
- a chart-your-own-course mentality that rewards those who aggressively seek out the job they want and pursue it, or sometimes even create it","After my long tenure and many Dreamforce conferences, I'm nearly fried. To say the culture is fast paced and the focus is always changing is an understatement. The reason Salesforce always seems on top, and chasing the latest trend, and in the press, is because employees are expected to run harder, carry more, cheer loudly, and pivot constantly. It's the world's biggest startup in behavior. But at the same time, with the recent influx of top career sales leaders from Oracle and what appears to be a board-level mandate for doubling revenue, employees are being asked to do even more with even less, fill higher quotas with smaller territories, less help, and the big company bureaucracy is rearing it's ugly head. 

Worse still is the politics. When you hire a bunch of smart, aggressive people, and put them in an environment of outsized expectations, throw in a bunch of re-orgs and changing management,  and sprinkle with uncertainty and constantly changing priorities, you inevitably get people back stabbing each other and throwing others under the bus to appear smarter and more worthy of promotion. 

The few at the top will get very, very rich. The rest will lose the sense of personal ownership and start to wonder why they've given up health and family"

- generous maternity/paternity leave. Although this will affect your likelihood of be promoted","I came into Salesforce like every rep, excited and eager to get my “MBA” in sales. Working here you’ll have to be prepared to give up everything just to stay afloat. In the first year you will most likely be given a terrible territory and what you do with it will decide your future here. Things you will need to juggle effortlessly or will lead you down the road of being let go are:

- Activity- lots of calls. People who fib numbers here are celebrated by leadership but frowned upon by reps
- Opp rigor- the amount of fields you will need to update are mind numbing
- Pipeline- with a terrible territory be prepared to pipe aspirational pipeline that will be highly scrutinized
- Prep meetings- there are endless prep meetings before calls. Due to schedules each person involved will require a prep meeting, leaving your day with little time for anything else.
- Team selling- be prepared to sell with folks much junior than you and not held to as high of standards. If the deal falls through, it’s on you. There are a few coprimes that are skilled sales reps
- Your “brand”- It’s important to maintain appearances, even on bad days. Your brand is determined by how involved you are in diversity, volunteer work, and leading the team, which requires tenure.
-Manager 1:1’s- these are a trap to look out for. Salesforce preaches trust as one of it pillars, but beware that everything said in those meetings will be used against you when they have soured on you
- Time management- working a 12 hr day is table stakes. There are endless distractions you will need to navigate and make hard decisions on “brand”/ appearance maintenance vs selling

The work/life balance is very heavy on the work side. The exec team repeatedly say their biggest regrets are not spending enough time with family. This will never change if they don’t take it serious. There is a lot you can learn here but at the expense of your self confidence as some managers make you feel worthless when your awful territory isn’t performing. If that isn’t enough to make you steer clear, the pay is very low and less than 20% of reps hit their annual numbers

The “Ohana” culture is a mirage. There is nothing remotely familial about the culture. It is an ultra competitive pressure cooker. I just had such higher hopes for my experience left disappointed..."

Exceptional Colleagues: The company is home to an incredibly talented pool of individual contributors, who are not only skilled in their respective fields but also collaborative and supportive.

This can hinder innovation and responsiveness to market shifts.

Misaligned Prioritisation: There's a noticeable emphasis on meeting sales targets and quotas, sometimes at the expense of truly addressing customer needs and ensuring their success.

Salesforce,2,21-Jan-24,"Used to be good, now toxic",Lead Member Technical Staff (LMTS),"Former Employee, more than 5 years",,Mostly good co-workers and interesting way to platformize products and solve multi-tenancy.,"Salesforce used to a be good company but changed a lot after the layoffs. Product is scrambling to ship solutions with very little market research. This results in engineers being told that the work is very important but once shipped, these products have 0 customers. There is also a culture of fear- our PM would tell our team that if we don't ship fast, we are all going to get laid off.
Weak and ineffective eng management- did absolutely nothing to address problems and like other reviews have mentioned, any complaints to HR results in a PIP. HR does not care about you or the toxic environment, they will protect your manager. I regularly had things made up about me that were easily refuted by slack conversations and work item comments. No one cares. Your manager can and will destroy you if it furthers their own career. Asking questions is seen as insubordination and will get you fired. As others have pointed out, not a safe place for women who want to further their career. If you are early in your career and ok with working nights and weekend because you are told your product is necessary, only to ship it and have it not sold, this place is for you.
The tech stack is old and can be frustrating at times. I am so glad to be gone. Also, I would be highly skeptical of the 5 star reviews- Salesforce is an aggressive marketer of both its products and culture."

They've also made a huge effort around pay equity. A great place to learn the tried and true industry strategies that work.,"Can be very political. Many middle managers vying for their next promotion instead of coaching their teams and helping them grow in their careers. Depending on the team, promotions seem to be based on who's liked the most and who the squeaky wheel is rather than merit and potential. For many teams, the layoffs have led to losing invaluable product knowledge and organizational chaos. No transparency about how layoff decisions were made. Lots of change management, re-orgs, and title changes causing employees to be forced into new roles they don't want if they want to stay employed. Salesforce shifts gears like a startup - could be good or bad depending on your perspective.

The work is interesting and there are loads of resources to grow personally and professionally… if you have anything left over emotionally to invest in yourself.","Everyone is scrambling to still justify their roles, work and departments to mid level leaders that seem disconnected from the top line decisions being made about programs, people, and layoffs. The result is a “report on everything” culture of micromanagement and having to spend so much time documenting the job it’s hard to find enough time to do the job- let alone engage with ERGs, personal development, or outside of work board positions and volunteering. This period of uncertainty and change makes it hard to get your footing- many people including myself had had 2-3 managers in just the last 8 months."
Salesforce,3,22-Jan-24,Changed Significantly through Covid and beyond,Solutions Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,#NAME?,"- Leadership has been very weak since layoffs, too afraid to stand up for their team or themselves due to fear of layoffs.
- Upward mobility is extremely difficult, be prepared to do the job of a Principal while being compensated for much less. If you want to move up in a company, I cannot suggest Salesforce as it is typically luck of the draw or how you were hired.
- Role expansion with no compensation
- Benefits every year get worse and worse, they are taking things away slowly
- Management/Leaders only care about ""managing up"", be prepared to get minimal assistance from those above you"

Salesforce,1,4-Feb-24,Good luck,Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Seattle, WA",It's a large company with seemingly endless opportunities. The benefits are great.,"Pay leaves a lot to be desired.

There is very little training and development in place within certain orgs, so you need to be self-sufficient.

There are a million levels of middle management, so everyone is a VP of something, and nobody is good at their job.

People in all levels of management within certain orgs are completely incompetent. The Peter Principle is how it is best described.

Everyone there thinks that because they work there, their (blank) doesn't stink. The arrogance is obnoxious.

If you ever need help with anything, don't expect to get helpful answers from anyone. Plan on searching internal systems and learning on your own.

Forget product training. Better use Google and YouTube.

Managers are not your friends, nor are the other employees. If you say something to someone, trust that everyone will know, so keep it related to work.

The people there are only in it for themselves and will happily stab anyone in the back to get what they want.

If you aren't in the inner sanctum, you will feel like an outsider. Very clicky environment."
Salesforce,5,4-Feb-24,Exceptional Employee Experience: A 5-star Journey at Salesforce,Lead Solutions Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","San Francisco, CA","As a proud member of the Salesforce family, I couldn't be more thrilled to share my incredible journey working with this esteemed company. From day one, I've been immersed in a culture of excellence, collaboration, and support that truly sets Salesforce apart as an employer of choice.

1. Generous Employee Benefits: Salesforce's commitment to its employees shines brightly through its comprehensive benefits package. The 6-month parental leave policy is a testament to the company's dedication to supporting work-life balance and family values.
2. World-Class Office Spaces: The work environment at Salesforce is nothing short of breathtaking. With beautifully designed offices and top-notch amenities, every day feels like a step into a space crafted for success and inspiration.
3. Outstanding Work Teams and Culture: One of the standout aspects of working at Salesforce is the opportunity to collaborate with exceptional colleagues who are not just coworkers but also mentors and friends. The culture of inclusivity, innovation, and empowerment fosters personal growth and professional development in ways I never imagined possible.","While my experience at Salesforce has been overwhelmingly positive, it's essential to acknowledge that, like any large enterprise, there are challenges. One notable area for improvement is the complexity of navigating the team structure. At times, it can be daunting to understand where to go or who to connect with, but with the right resources and support, these hurdles become opportunities for growth and learning."
Salesforce,1,12-Feb-24,All time high profits and still doing layoffs!,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"You might get a barista in certain offices. The downside is RTO (despite the data stating people are more productive from home, it's better for their wallets, better for the environment, etc.)","Salesforce will lay off hundreds or even thousands. They won't make any internal communications about it. That's what Salesforce means when they say ""Ohana/family"". After these quiet firings, you can find Tableau executives saying that people upset by the layoffs are children in the wallstreetbets slack channel. 0 emotional intelligence.

Profits are skyrocketing and at an all time high. Yet the greedy executives still want more for themselves and less for everyone else.

Raises are anywhere from 2-7% in my org. High performers get a few measly percents more than everyone else. No RSUs for new hires. What a joke."

They have regular assessments during the probation which adds to the stress of the job. The company undergoes many reorganizational changes regularly which means you could end up with three different managers in a span of two months which causes a strain during onboarding but it is not considered during your assessments. I received a threatening message at 8pm on a friday letting me know that if I fail the assessment I will be fired. I felt lost most of the time and felt like they dint care too much about their new employees. I was regularly made aware that if make a mistake during my probation I will be creating a long lasting bad impression. In the end, I did not fair well in the assessment as I felt the task was set to make me fail. The process felt premeditated with the outcome already decided. I was let go after 3 months of joining.

The culture here is so supportive. PTO is flexible, really depends on your manager but they don't babysit you. As long as you are hitting your numbers, they aren't looking over your shoulder. I am in the SMB new logo sector (arguably the hardest sector for a BDR) but I love the challenge. My manager and director are some of the nicest people I have ever met, and I always feel supported to reach my goals.

Everyone at Salesforce wants you to win (or in my experience) I even flew out to Irvine to meet my AE's and VP's, they all vouched for me and how excited they are for me to get promoted.

Customers who end up purchasing soon realise that it becomes too expensive to implement. See Trustpilot reviews
- Even if you managed to get it running, you will realise that you now need to hire an army of ""Salesforce certified"" developers to operate it. 
- 90% of all SMB accounts sold become red accounts in less than a year and thats when they refuse to pay their bills and send their lawyers to get out of their contract.
- Hit and run deals. You will never hear from the AE that sold to you again. Ask for a free trial of the product not a ""scripted demo"" and to speak to customers as references."

Almost every experience has been scarring. I got to Salesforce with high hopes, but low expectations. I have been here for almost 8 months now, and I could cry because I actually feel like I got it right this time lol. I enjoy coming to work every day- even look forward to it?? The culture here is so supportive. PTO is flexible, really depends on your manager but they don't babysit you. As long as you are hitting your numbers, they aren't looking over your shoulder. I am in the SMB new logo sector (arguably the hardest sector for a BDR) but I love the challenge. My manager and director are some of the nicest people I have ever met, and I always feel supported to reach my goals.

Everyone at Salesforce wants you to win (or in my experience) I even flew out to Irvine to meet my AE's and VP's, they all vouched for me and how excited they are for me to get promoted. I have never been apart of something like that in my life, it just feels good knowing I have a team I can count on.

If you stay organized, hit your metrics, and are continuously hungry to learn... you will thrive here.",Trying to push in office culture a little too much lately. Not allowed to work remote without taking PTO (not sure how long that will last)... that whole bit is confusing.

However, my dissatisfaction primarily due to the flawed Revenue Recognition system, especially within Salesforce where the distinction between Core AE and Specialists AE creates issues. 
Specialists focus on specific solutions, but their numbers are negatively impacted by attrition on unrelated solutions within the same account. This results in absurd scenarios, such as a Pardot AE losing out on revenue recognition despite significant efforts, thanks to attrition in other areas. 

Besides that, the organizational decisions, like unnecessary retrenchment followed by rehiring, showcase a lack of coherent management strategy. 

Additionally, blatant favoritism and frequent restructuring further contribute to an unstable work environment, prompting many to leave due to perceived lack of sales potential and the discrepancy between external appearances and internal realities."

Through roles involving team management and exceeding production standards, I showcased unwavering dedication to excellence. Active participation in client meetings underscored my commitment to client satisfaction, while contributions as a Buganizer demonstrated problem-solving skills. Achievements, including promotions and recognition, reflect consistent performance and acknowledgment as the Best Employee. Eager to leverage this multifaceted skill set, I am ready to contribute to new challenges and future successes.","While my tenure at Wipro has been rewarding, it's important to note potential challenges. Balancing work-life flexibility, especially with varied hours, has been demanding. Client satisfaction, though crucial, introduces a dependency on fluctuating client expectations. Meeting stressful production targets, while showcasing commitment, may impact overall well-being. Limited autonomy in decision-making, particularly as a Single Point of Contact, poses challenges for implementing innovative solutions independently. These cons, however, have been opportunities for growth and continuous improvement."

If you are kind of person who doesn’t want to be bothered by people in organisation then it is heaven to you because then you can follow the culture to not to respond to chats or emails for ages.

If you are applying for management role like Project Management / Account Executive then it is heaven to you because then you have full control and support to use technical resources as puppets.","No professional growth in technical domain in Australia, because there is no dependency on technical peoples here as company has army of technical peoples in India, and you can easily be replaced by offshore people.

There are high chances that you will forget what you used to perform in earlier jobs as there is no real current technical work.

As a full time worker, once your current project is completed, it is super hard to find new project in Australia, high chances of getting redundant."
Wipro,4,12-Jan-24,Unlocking Tech Marvels: TIBCO Developer Gig is a Wild Ride!,Tibco Developer/Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Hyderābād,"High Demand: TIBCO developers are in demand across various industries, ensuring a steady flow of job opportunities.

Versatility: TIBCO's suite of products allows developers to work on diverse projects, gaining expertise in various aspects of integration, analytics, and business process management.

Integration Mastery: TIBCO's strong integration capabilities make developers adept at connecting different systems and technologies seamlessly.

Scalability Challenges: Tackling large volumes of data and transactions in enterprise-level applications provides opportunities for developers to hone their skills in building scalable solutions.

Diverse Toolset: Working with a range of TIBCO tools and technologies exposes developers to a diverse set of skills, contributing to their professional growth.

Competitive Remuneration: TIBCO developers often receive competitive salaries and benefits due to the specialized nature of their skills and the demand for their expertise.

Global Opportunities: TIBCO is used worldwide, offering developers the chance to work on international projects or even consider relocation.","Continuous Learning: Staying current with evolving technologies and industry trends is essential, requiring a commitment to continuous learning.

Specialized Skill Set: TIBCO skills may be highly specialized, limiting career flexibility compared to more general programming languages or frameworks.

Complexity: Handling integration in complex enterprise environments can be challenging and requires a deep understanding of both business processes and technical systems.

Dependency on Company Adoption: Job opportunities may be influenced by the extent to which companies in certain industries adopt TIBCO technologies.

Niche Focus: TIBCO development may be considered niche, potentially limiting the variety of job opportunities available compared to more mainstream technologies.

Project Variation: While some may find the variety of projects exciting, others may prefer a more consistent and predictable workload."

This can help QA testers advance their careers and become more marketable to other companies.
Varied work environment: Wipro has a global presence, so QA testers can work on projects for a variety of clients in different industries. This can provide a lot of variety and help testers to develop a broad range of skills.
Good work-life balance: Many reviewers reported that Wipro has a good work-life balance, with reasonable hours and opportunities for telecommuting or flextime.","Compensation: Some reviewers reported that the compensation at Wipro is not as competitive as at other IT companies.
Bureaucracy: Some reviewers reported that Wipro can be a bureaucratic company, with a lot of red tape to navigate.
Lack of upward mobility: Some reviewers reported that it can be difficult to advance in your career at Wipro, especially if you are not a ""yes man.""
Overall, working at Wipro as a QA tester can be a good option for individuals who are looking for a company with a variety of opportunities for growth and development.

In reality, your career opportunities are dictated to you by a team in India that has zero interest in your passions or skill set. Diversity is shamefully disappointing. Teams do not embrace diversity of backgrounds, and my new ideas were not welcome. Culture is rooted in bullying. I would routinely finish my work by the late afternoon and receuce missed calls from my manager while working out, living my life, etc. To quote the manager, “you get 30min for lunch. 30min for dinner. And the rest of the day you must be available.” He should have simply stated, “you are always responsible for others being terrible at their job.” Senior management is the most pompous, self-important group of people. Even recent hires are guilty of bureaucratic management practices. They’ll spend the entire day peacocking to their bosses boss, manufacturing stress to their direct reports and adding negative value."
Wipro,4,8-Nov-23,A Rewarding experience at Wipro Technologies,Project Engineer,Current Employee,,"Innovative Environment: Wipro places a strong emphasis on innovation, providing employees with opportunities to work on cutting-edge technologies and groundbreaking projects. Learning and Development: The company invests in employee growth through various training programs, workshops, and certifications. This has allowed me to expand my skill set and stay up-to-date with industry trends. Collaborative Culture: Wipro fosters a culture of collaboration, where teams work together seamlessly to achieve common goals. This has created a supportive and friendly work atmosphere. Global Exposure: Wipro is a multinational company with a diverse clientele, providing employees with the chance to work on projects with a global impact and interact with teams from different regions. Work-Life Balance: While the workload can be demanding at times, Wipro generally values work-life balance and provides flexible working arrangements when needed.","Workload Intensity: At times, the workload can be demanding, especially during peak project phases. This may require employees to manage their time and priorities effectively. Hierarchy and Bureaucracy: Like many large organizations, Wipro has a structured hierarchy, which can occasionally lead to bureaucratic processes and decision-making. Client Dependency: Some projects may require extensive client interactions, which can lead to varying levels of engagement and expectations from different clients. Limited Autonomy on Project Selection: As an IT consultant, I found that project assignments are generally determined by client needs and organizational priorities, which may limit personal preferences for project selection. Competitive Industry: The IT consulting industry is highly competitive, and Wipro faces stiff competition from other major players. This can sometimes lead to intense pressure to deliver results."

Good benefits
Career opportunities - New Technologies
Talented individuals are recognized and given good opportunities and benefits.","Mandatory 3 days WFO is Great! but people who commute on bikes are very likely to meet with an accident in cities like Bengaluru where there is huge Traffic problem and employees who commute by car are most likely to spend 3 to 4hrs on road due to traffic. 
And the infrastructure cannot be modified or altered immediately. All IT companies smart heads should get together to find a solution for it. If not, people should be allowed to work from home at least 3 or 4 days a week and be productive, By doing this even the Traffic can be reduced."

I would not work in this company even if they offer me a million dollar. It is like all the roadside labors are just dressed well and working here.
2. You cannot even sleep. Logout at 11pm and login at 5am. Frequent shift changes. Shift changes twice a week = Zero work life balance.
3. Managers are bunch of jerks and they do not know what US client is saying and they ask their subordinates to translate in Telugu what was said by client.
4. Managers glory themselves saying that they work 16 hours and many idiots copy this unhealthy practice to look good. Work same 16 hours and resign due to health issues. 8 hours healthy work is enough. Utilize employee in the shift hours.
5. Open discrimination of contractor employees.
6. Managers cooks stories when US Client ask why so and so person is not in the meeting. Even if the employee is trying to join the meeting, these cunning managers say 'he is on leave today'.
7. No basic support to disabled employee. The wheel chair and security guard are lying wasted near the gate and when disabled employee ask the wheel chair just for a 5 meter distance, they make him more late by asking to send an email and bla bla.
8. You can join this company to experience how bad the work culture can be."

No work life balance. Managers don’t know the art of saying no. Even a small escalation is treated as if it’s life threatening.
Culture has only degraded over the years. It’s no longer the strength of this organization.
Compensation is a joke. Salary parity is an even bigger joke. No one is laughing though. Management is always crying about shortage of funds but ready to hire at insanely high salaries or restruture compensation for a select few (e. g MBA hired) without any regards to the general population."

Complex Organizational Structure: Due to their extensive service portfolio and global operations, their organizational structure can be complex, which may lead to challenges in communication and decision-making. Data Security Concerns: Given the nature of their services, data security is a significant concern for both Wipro and their clients.

I'm a US Citizen and live in New Jersey.

Opportunities for Growth: Wipro provides employees with ample opportunities to grow and develop their skills. The company offers various training programs, mentorship initiatives, and career advancement opportunities to help employees reach their full potential.

Collaborative Work Environment: Wipro fosters a collaborative work environment where teamwork and knowledge sharing are encouraged. Employees have the chance to collaborate with colleagues from diverse backgrounds and expertise, leading to a rich and stimulating work experience.","Work-Life Balance: Like any fast-paced organization, maintaining a work-life balance can sometimes be challenging at Wipro. The nature of the work and client demands may require employees to put in extra hours, which can impact personal time and well-being.

Communication and Transparency: I see the need for improved communication and transparency. Clearer communication channels and more transparency in decision-making processes would enhance employee satisfaction and engagement.

Workload Management: At times, employees may face high workloads and tight timelines. While it can be an opportunity for growth and learning, it is important for the management to ensure a balanced distribution of workload to prevent burnout."

But they are so low as not to announce you being fired, they are forcing you to sign a mutual agreement, where you have to give up your unemployment benefits. They try to do this with zero information given to you, it's impossible to get explanations from HR department even if you ask clearly (it's actually one person and very unqualified). They do not have other projects to assign you, they don't want to deal with legal obligations as to fire you officially, they do not communicate anything openly whilst some of their company values are Transparency and Openness and Communication.

Cisco Systems,4,13-Mar-15,The grass isn't always greener...,"Manager, Network Services","Former Employee, more than 3 years","San Jose, CA","I decided to wait almost a year after leaving the company before posting a review.  The primary reason being is that when you decide to leave an organization it is usually because there is something there that isn't aligning with you or what you want anymore however, the grass is not always greener someplace else.  This has been my experience.  In fact, the appreciation I have for the company has grown so much in my time away that I would really like to return.

The company truly believes on promoting within and as an employee you are encouraged to grow your career within the organization and learn new skills by taking different positions.  Benefits are excellent.  Cisco is the industry leader for networking and now cloud.  It is sometimes easy to forget that on the daily grind but you are working for the company that everyone looks to for network and infrastructure standards.  Culture within the business units managing product lines give you a lot of freedom to be innovative and creative in your approach to your role.  In most cases you are given a fair amount of autonomy and control over how you do your job provided that it aligns with the strategic objectives.  Benefits, 401k match, RSUs and ESPP are amazing.  And while the salaries aren't the top of the industry, they are above market and pretty competitive.","Cisco can be a machine.  There isn't an overt demand for all of your time (even the time outside of work) but more of a subtle, slight encouragement to always be on.  If you are not careful, you will live, sleep and eat Cisco 24x7.  Don't get me wrong, this is 100% a choice and if you are aware of this subtlety in the culture it is very easy to set appropriate boundaries that will be respected by the company and leadership team.

If you don't like where you are in Cisco or what you are working on, give it 6 months because you will be reorg'd.  While it is sometimes necessary to realign the company to meet competitive threats or market demands, reorganizing the company once a year is excessive and tends to create a distrusting environment for the rank and file which makes being a leader in the organize challenging.  There is a loss of momentum and motivation that occurs a few months before and a few months after reorgs so this leaves the company being effective at delivery and execution only about 70% of the time.

While Cisco attracts some bright, motivated people the truth of the matter is you are either cut out for the company and its culture or you're not.  If you aren't it will be painfully obvious to you and those around you.  Sadly as a leader it is hard to cut dead weight from the team and the only really accepted way is via layoffs, which is why the company reorgs once a year despite the company line about the reorgs."
Cisco Systems,3,8-Feb-24,Unpredictable Goals,Account Manager,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Raleigh, NC","The benefits of working at Cisco are what keeps people in seat. Great healthcare, great stock options, great wfh atmosphere. The many different products that Cisco makes allows for account managers to hit their goal from one of their many product lines. The products that Cisco makes are phenomenal.","As a sales rep, you really have no control over what territory you cover, and what accounts you have this year to next. If you are not Enterprise sales rep, you could spend the entire year trying to develop a relationship with an account, only to find out that you no longer cover it when the new fiscal comes around. The goals drastically change, with no warrant to why or how they came up with this number. Finance also will regoal you and keep all your money. Mid-level management also has little to no control or say into how things are managed or done. Cisco sells against itself. Some products compete with each other, as well as some of the programs like NFR give products away."

The management is terrible, incompetent, and unprofessional. They have no clue what they are doing and they constantly micromanage, criticize, and undermine their employees. They also gossip and talk behind people's back too much, spreading rumors and lies about their performance, behavior, and personal lives. My ex manager was a walking HR violation and have made some suggestive advances towards me. They have no vision, no values, and no ethics. 

I would not recommend anyone to work here. They are a nightmare to deal with and they will make your life miserable. They are the worst management I have ever encountered and I hope they get exposed and fired soon"

My (2) teams were comprised of decent folks and I don't think they meant any harm, However they also seemed too busy or unwilling to help me through understanding certain aspects of my job and instead opting to do things themselves giving me very little to do and, thus, not much to learn.

Cisco Systems,4,6-Feb-24,Growing pains,Cybersecurity Specialist,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,Great team and great culture. Generally feel like I have job security in my BU,Cisco acquires a lot of companies and then tries to mesh them all together. This comes with a lot of issues for employees. I've now been here almost 3 years and every single month has been filled with change. I'm fine with change and reasonably adaptable but my org and my job have changed dramatically from the job I originally signed up to work. Our commission payouts have been messed up for over 6 months and the structure has changed to where we make less money than we did in previous years
Cisco Systems,4,21-Nov-23,Great benefits and flexibility,"Leader, Customer Experience","Current Employee, more than 5 years","Chicago, IL","Cisco lives up to a lot of their promises and top level leadership leads by example in encouraging their values. Cisco provides a lot of resources and opportunities to explore what you uniquely bring to your work, lead with your strengths, practice mindfulness, and keep balance and flexibility in your life. It is a place that strives to be welcoming and supportive of diverse communities with a lot of employee resource groups to help. Their benefits are great and receiving 80 hrs per year to volunteer is simply amazing. I hope they don't cut that back.","The PTO is 20 days per year, but you are forced to use 3-4 for those days during the mandatory holiday shutdown period, so the PTO is effectively 16 or 17 days. 
They have had a lot of unannounced layoffs or ""restructuring"" since I joined.
And like any large corporation, a lot of the internal processes and requirements are like navigating a maze to follow. 
It is also very slow to move and coming from an acquisition this was a hard transition. Also, when we were acquired, we thought we would get more resources to help, but that was not the case. 
Despite the ideals for how to be a good leader and make Cisco a great place to work, individual managers may or may not follow, leaving much variability in the working environment on a particular team."

Employee Recognition and Feedback:"
HCLTech,1,17-Jan-24,DONT JOIN HCL EDTECH,Technical Trainer,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",Pune,Good work from home. That’s it.,"My time here was disappointing. Salary was unsatisfactory. Hard work you put in gets no recognition, but being agreeable will. HR here lacks competence. Don't expect to raise a concern because they get defensive as though you have personal issues with them. The worst part is that you can't take leave even if you're entitled to, as you have a balance. They treat you badly like as though you did a bad mistake and if you take leave and will call you even for something unimportant. They expect you to work during weekends with no compensation or extra pay. Working here feels challenging; never join this EduTech in HCL because the leadership is unstable and toxic. You don't know who your client is or what is expected, but they want things delivered quickly without giving decent time to think and gather resources. Planning is so poor that nothing ever anyone does will actually be useful, and every work that you have been breaking your head for will go into the dustbin. Employees below band 3 are treated poorly. My work as a trainer involved travel, and the hotels they book for us are very very bad. Spending a little more won't damage your company financially, especially when you boast that the owners are the richest in India. Treat employees well. Don't keep hiring retired people who contribute nothing, while those doing the hard work are worked like donkeys and have to slog for peanuts. Invest in good people, and you will automatically have good clients. Don't treat youngsters like cheap labor."
HCLTech,5,6-Feb-24,Data Analyst,Data Analyst,Current Employee,,"Global Presence: HCL Tech has a strong global presence with operations in multiple countries, serving clients across various industries. This global footprint allows them to tap into diverse markets and gain insights into different business landscapes.

Innovation Focus: HCL Tech has a strong focus on innovation and has invested significantly in research and development. They have dedicated innovation labs and centers of excellence that focus on emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, and IoT, enabling them to deliver cutting-edge solutions to their clients.","Cultural Challenges: HCL Tech has faced criticism in the past for its work culture, which some employees and observers have described as intense and demanding. The company's emphasis on performance and results can sometimes lead to high-pressure work environments, which may not be suitable for everyone.

Dependency on Outsourcing: Like many other IT services companies, HCL Tech relies heavily on outsourcing, particularly offshore outsourcing to countries like India. While this model offers cost advantages, it can also pose challenges related to communication, coordination, and quality control, especially when dealing with geographically dispersed teams."
HCLTech,1,8-Feb-24,Very bad experience with HCL,System Administrator,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Pune,There is not anything good to say,"I had a very bad experience with the HCL Management team Pune....they hired me as per my experience and aligned with different team at the client location....Also they didn't inform me about the HCL probation policy that we need to serve a 3 month notice period in probation time and when I ask the HCL RM, he is telling me there is no probation period in HCL.

They hire many freshers with non technical skills/degree or BCA degree, who do not have the right vision/attitude towards work and ultimately staling the who IT industry. My RM was having BA degree and that person was managing multiple roles with absolutely no sense, and she was promoted to RM due to other benefits.
2. Management likes favouritism.
3.Very less to learn new things i asked multiple time to my manager to give me more tasks as i was having more bandwidth to do things but it all went in vain."
HCLTech,5,31-Jan-24,Empresa muito inclusiva,Service Desk Analyst,Current Employee,,"Meu projeto é home office e foi a minha primeira experiência com esse regime de trabalho. Ao passo que muitas empresas não aceitam um ""novato"" para o trabalho totalmente remoto, a HCL aceitou e foi/tem sido uma experiência gratificante para mim. Até então foi o melhor ambiente de trabalho em que já estive. Não existe intencionalmente um estabelecimento de cultura da empresa sobre isso (pelo menos não com treinamentos e palestras), Creio que seja muito fruto da equipe da qual faço parte.  Além disso, eles dão vale alimentação, vale refeição e plano médico sem coparticipação.","Sou um analista trilingue, creio que o salario poderia ser mais alto. Outro ponto contra, mas que faz mais parte do meu cargo, é a falta de flexibilidade. Apesar de ser remoto, não posso trabalhar de onde quiser. Posso apenas trabalhar em território brasileiro."

After gaining experience and moving up, this experience from here will support you better.","1. No proper communication from HR & RM
2. No increment, shift allowance or bonus.
3. U will be demanded for 24/7 availability, which is humanly not possible.
4. No nyt shift allowance n depends upon project u joining up.
5. Poor management & attitude towards team mates from leaderships.
6.No holidays in IND calendar or for u. Which means no CH allowance, the least we expect if we work on that day."
HCLTech,2,16-Jan-24,A black dot at the career,Lead Analyst,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Bengaluru,Nothing much apart of salary at the end of the each month,"Its terrible work experience with this organization, they hired us for collection process and never assigned to us. Instead of collection, we begin with some backlog clearance process.
Lack of coordination with employee and manger, no basic facilities at the office premises like lunch or dinner, snakes etc. very poor maintains in washroom and nobody will listen your issues, they will simply ignore if you raised for anything."
HCLTech,1,5-Dec-23,"Bad experience, lots of micromanagement, toxic work environment ",Lead Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Noida,"Nothing at all, they will cut your salary, they install sappien software to track your laptop and will ask you to complete 9 hours in sappien. No hike, only manager enjoy their life","Guys, remember this. Maybe many of you will face a similar situation. My laptop was issued from the Chennai office, and then I moved to Noida. In my notice period, they asked me to work until the last day and submit my laptop on the last day only. When I went to submit my laptop, the IT team told me to either submit it in the Chennai office on my own or send it by courier with my own arrangements. They also mentioned that if something happens to my laptop, they would charge $1200. I tried escalating the issue up to the VP level through email to get help so that I could submit my laptop in Noida, but nobody cared. I ended up sending my laptop by courier, paying Rs. 2500 from my pocket. They didn't inform me about this cost in advance. So submit your laptop at least a week before the last working day. This level of cost-cutting is disappointing. The management and politics at HCLTECH are very poor. I would advise against joining HCLTECH in the future."
HCLTech,1,26-Jan-24,This company is horrible,IT Engineer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Worcester, MA",There are none. People think that they are going to retire from here. That is a joke.

The management is terrible and out to save themselves.,"I have heard that there is an U.S. Federal investigation into the racisim of one of the U.S. teams and their management, a team lead and others. This is indicative of how they operate. These people talk about their executive team who are Indian behind their backs and suck up in their presence to keep a job and resent the indian leaders. This is not a place for advancement, it will derail your career. Good luck, you will need it."

Sometimes it takes months to resolve a simple pay query. Compensation is split over multiple components which you have to constantly fight to be renewed. Senior managers spend a lot of their time simply chasing the bloated broken HR machine instead of focusing on their projects."

Conducive work facilities","Situated in industrial area, lack of food amenities, need to take company shuttle or eat in company cafetaria or a nearby small foodcourt which has limited options. 

Career progress can be slow, depending on the leadership and project management skillset of the leads, many who want to take the credit for themselves instead of looking at recognising the efforts of team members. Can feel left out.

Personally, the role and level of experience i had applied for and the role i got did not match (felt conned by HR), and this was also evident from the compensation (no 13 mth bonus by default, and performance appraisal was not fair). 

Please ensure that the job description in the role match what is assigned, if not its better to consider seeking better roles during the probation period itself."

Many training courses available (though may not always have the budget or time to sign up)","It is quite a shock that the company has been existent as a SI for so many years, but there are no established processes and knowledge management content and hence, standards differ very much among similar projects. Though there are training courses available, but they are not made mandatory to some crucial roles like PMs, where many don't even know what are the basic tools or processes in the company. 
Cost cutting is strictly observed for the sake of doing it and there are no replacement of headcount even there are resignation cases and only when customers start banging tables and escalate to the sky, then the replacement request will be acceded. There is no investment in building the capabilities nor retention of good staff, but yet management will question why projects are not won.
Internal politics struggle among team in meeting their own agenda and revenue targets, and there is no synergy working among teams to leverage on each other's offerings and strength.
There are no KPIs enforced in performance appraisal and top down goals replicated from management to the staff. However, revenue targets given to the team are usually unachievable and unbelievable."

Also, there are plenty of people who somehow manage to find time to sleep at A2 and the rec room, so if you want to kun, you can go there.","Lots of politicking so work performance doesn't matter. Some departments do not set out KPIs at all for the year, so your performance appraisal totally depends on how much your boss likes you. So in spite of working hard for the company, at the end of the day, it's obvious the 'high performers' are the ones who go out with the boss for breakfast, lunch, coffee, smoke break, dinner! 

Also, the English and grammar used in this company is atrocious. When you pick up any brochure at the lobby to read, you have no idea what they're trying to say because it's all a bunch of IT jargon put together and you still don't know what the product is. It's pretty embarrassing especially when you have potential foreign clients.

Please do yourself a favour and try out at an MNC if you want to go into IT. At least they have KPIs and legitimate appraisals."

He informed me during the interview that when I joined the company and deployed to the site, he would provide onsite assistance as BAU (business as usual). At that point, the interviewer left. Because of the lack of manpower for this new project, after working for three to five months, you felt stuck in your position because the job scope was so narrow. It is quite terrible for an interviewer to lie like that. perform in bulk, but there is little diversity The manager and the assistant monitor employee performance. essentially means that when you're not good in a given area, it's not helping you or your team on. and you will only be performing everyday engineering work, which is extremely restricted and has little room for advancement they will do their own job among themself... If you are a fortunate senior like you, however, you will be able to learn beyond the limitations of the engineering function. overall the Manager and Senior engineer is not bad to work together...."

Note:
1) If you're considering joining, Insist on a written guarantee that ensures I am assigned a project from day 1.
2) also same for work from home","1) Lack of Growth and Opportunities for Developers

2) Absence of Development Projects; Existing Projects are on the Verge of Closure

3) Job Insecurity for Bench Employees due to a Severe Lack of Development Projects

4) Company is Predominantly Service-Based; Project Assignments Primarily Involve Support Tasks

5) Poor Management; Uninspiring Work Environment; Discrepancy Between Written Commitments to Work-Life Balance and Actual Practices. Some Leaders Mistreat Employees, Claiming an Unwarranted Authority and Often Taking Credit for the Employees' Work in Front of Higher-ups.

6) Challenges for Freshers in Getting Billable; High Risk of Layoffs After a Year of Bench Period

7) Annual Increment Ranges from 0 to 7% at Maximum; No Annual Bonus, Despite Inclusion in CTC

8) Contributions Beyond Project Work Not Considered in Annual and Quarterly Reviews

9) Strict 8-Hour Workday; While There's No Screen Monitoring, Entry and Exit Times are Recorded for Office-based Work.

10) Skills-Based Hiring Does Not Necessarily Align with Project Assignments"

The ARQ business caused divide and even more divide with NCS not knowing what they want and just wasting time on meaningless processes that go no where.

The market opportunities are really solid compared to many other startups. Senior leadership is (in my opinion) really pro-active and competent in growing the business.

There's quite a bit of mess though, but mess represents opportunities to have a big impact, so long as you can come to terms with that. The corollary is that you reasonably can expect to have better (i.e. easier) opportunities to have a larger impact than some of the more mature tech companies in Seattle.

Founders are truly passionate, and do take concrete action in trying to create a good culture.","Grab has been suffering from relatively high turnover and attrition. While building an enduring engineering organization is one of the OKRs, but I've seen very little attention given by upper management and concrete plans communicated on what steps the organization is taking towards this. All the oxygen is spent on outcompeting in our strategic markets, growing the business, or keeping our service up. 

So... amongst other things, forget about any sort of training on things like ethics and compliance, diversity and inclusion. It results in situations such as there being (large) teams in Seattle which suffer from extreme homogeneity in race/country-of-origin... and where if you're not a member of this race, you're part of the out-group... 

... and unfortunately, being part of the out-group has very real repercussions beyond the social aspects..."

The dedication to a commendable cause is a driving force that fosters a sense of collective commitment.","Leadership Immaturity: Grab has witnessed immature leadership, marked by knee-jerk reactions over the past two years, leading to an uncertain work environment and abrupt changes that impact overall stability.
Diversity and Inclusion Concerns: Non-local or non-Chinese employees may experience racism in day-to-day conversations. Additionally, data on hiring and promotions raises concerns about an unfair skew towards Chinese ethnicity, necessitating urgent attention to foster a more inclusive workplace.
Bullying Complaints Ignored: Formal and informal complaints about bullying, supported by evidence, appear to be consistently ignored. This lapse in addressing employee well-being contributes to a less-than-ideal workplace culture. Particularly alarming is the prevalence of bullying among senior leaders, indicating a systemic issue that demands immediate intervention. Concerns raised via whistleblowing channels seem to be disregarded, exacerbating the problem.
Strategic Deficiency: The company tends to be more tactical than strategic, emphasizing immediate actions over long-term planning. This impacts Grab's overall effectiveness and requires a reevaluation of the strategic approach.
Cost Management Priorities: Grab's approach to cost management raises questions, with decisions seeming less thoughtful regarding retaining valuable leaders and choosing advisors. There's a notable tendency to make sweeping changes while simultaneously investing substantial sums in campaigns, leading to concerns about resource allocation.
Flawed ""Grab Life"" HR Vision: ""The Grab Life,"" a HR vision document, is perceived as ineffective, reflecting a misguided focus on the wrong aspects of employee experience. This highlights another instance of leadership immaturity, as the emphasis on such initiatives might be diverting attention from more critical factors for driving success."

If you have P&L responsibility, you will be asked and expected to do unnatural things with forecasts and financials in order to drive the stock price. This company is not looking out for the best interest of their retail partners, end customers, and certainly not their mid-level employees. It's a serious shame given that it used to be an excellent place to work and one that valued morals and doing what is right. Advancement is limited unless someone quits, retires, or dies. You will be strung along with the promise of moving up when in reality they expect you to take on more work and more responsibility, including training and mentoring, while taking pay cuts. Additionally, their benefits are disproportionately expensive for such a large company and the pay is not competitive to other tech."

I am given a lot of freedom in what I work on. People are generally nice. They encourage career cross training across orgs. They do have business networks which throw events which encourages people to talk to others they may not normally get the chance to. Unlimited time off (depends on the management though.) I think if you’re trying to gain experience and show career growth for your next company it’s a solid place to work.,Pay is middle of the road. The priorities are all over the place. There is a new organization every day. So many teams it’s hard to track down how to fix something. A lot of “well this isn’t my job” and lack of ownership. Conflicting business objectives across the board. Employees are used to development tickets taking 6-7 months to be completed. New product focus with low resources for products in the field. So many people that have been here 20+ years. It’s hard to push for modernization when some people are stuck in the “this is how it’s been” mentality. Lack of industry best practices knowledge shows in business objectives and software.

Leadership from Senior Director down is very good.,"You can’t trust HR, they are here to protect the company, not the employees. Senior management is the worst I’ve ever experienced, and it keeps getting worse. They tell the employees what they want them to hear and then do something completely different. Managers are only allowed to promote 10% of their team each year. So a team of 10, only 1 promotion this year. Hey new intern, it’s going to be 10 years before you get a promotion. Quotas on annual reviews. Only 10% can exceed expectations, 80% will meet and you must have 10% that fail to meet expectations. Why can’t we just be honest and rate people the way they deserve."

Hybrid WFH could be worse (some people like it, some people don't, so it's probably a good balance - they just need to clear a few things up)","Cybersecurity leadership is horrible. They are more interested in making the person above them look good so they can get promoted at the cost of security and doing the right thing to protect customer data. I had a Director take an idea I worked on and present it as theirs alone, which is not a way to inspire more ideas. 

I also have multiple directors I need to report to because there is an outdated idea that you need someone local to report to.

I've even heard one leader yell and swear in a conference call with their leaders (not sure exactly about what, but I have my suspicions it was a around a self identified gap that would make their boss look bad).

And return to office metrics make no sense. They have some weird math to calculate how much in office is 50%. I've had more than one colleague get burned by it not being clear. To be clear, they were not let go, just a nice stern talking to (their words)."

2.) ""Nice"" people and leadership

3.) Autonomy (at least, in my role)

4.) Interesting problems to solve","1.) Dishonest leadership, dishonest ER / HR

2.) SECURITY HOLE! My former immediate supervisor uses a non-corporate WhatsApp account, for communication between international offices / engineering teams, instead of the communications / conferencing tools Visa licenses and provides. I'm fairly certain there is neither corporate oversight, nor even permissions provided, to do so.

3.) A spaghetti nightmare of websites / webapps and navigation, for everything from access requests, internal tooling, software, service requests, to employee benefits. Absolutely the most expansive and least-well organzed of anywhere I've worked, over my nearly 20-year career. 

4.) (Minor) fewer extras / amenities than what other tech orgs offer.

The start of my short tenure at Visa was good, but ended horribly, in a way endemic to the tech industry's false narrative of diversity, inclusivity, empathy, and transparency. 

Unfortunately, my time with Visa was interrupted by a prison gang who targeted me, and my home, for harassment, stalking, and, at one point, attempted abduction, for nearly four weeks. This occurred day and night (and I have both still and video evidence, as well as police reports). This also, of course, impacted my productivity, as my safety and well-being were being threatened, and I safeguarded myself. 

Unfortunately, also, it brought out some ugly true colors, methinks, of Visa, as an employer and as a culture - at least in technology.

During this time of harassment, Visa Employee Relations (ER / HR) placed me on administrative leave and subjected me to two psychiatric evaluations, which Visa ER leadership stated were being conducted so Visa could best support my situation, esp. given I have both pre-existing high-functioning autism and PTSD.

Visa Employee Relations Leadership lied the entire way. It was made clear, by both psychiatrists, that the intent was, actually, to determine my suitability for continued employment. Empathy and transparency fail. Honesty fail. 

Ultimately, there was no feedback provided, nor result declared, regarding these psych evals, nor were they used as reasoning toward my termination. Not surprising, considering what was happening to me WAS REALLY HAPPENING.

I have requested the documented results of my exams, from the psychiatrists, only to be ignored. Likely, this is tangential to why such results weren't considered in my termination. Likely, there was nothing there to suggest I was unsuitable. This falls under HIPAA, so, denying me access to my records is illegal. 

While my severance payout was OK, their initial severance contract was, essentially, a ""hush"" contract, which would have nullified my rights to speak or write of any of what is here, the contents of the contract, or, even, the contract itself. This would also apply to my family, as the initial language also bound them.

However, the Nation Labor Relations Board had already set a legal precedent, by declaring, via court ruling, in Feb 2023, that EMPLOYERS CANNOT FORCE EMPLOYEES TO SIGN AWAY THEIR RIGHTS FOR A SEVERANCE PAYOUT. 

That last bit is in all caps, as other employees should probably make note. Per the above, Visa was forced to heavily modify the contract, being forced to remove large portions of its text, and reword others. Otherwise, I wouldn't be legally permitted to write this review!"

Visa Inc.,2,45230,Culture heavily depends on team,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,Overall good culture and above average benefits company wise.,"At accounting, C-level leadership's vision is very hard to get grounded from middle level management down, such as ""everyone can be a leader"". Managers and certain employees have been at the company for years, and it is very difficult to make changes due to top-down directive type culture from leadership. The opinions were not valued or supported and people managers' skills are extremely lacking in many teams and they simply do whatever upper management asked them to do. Especially in my org, it's a very restrictive, political culture, micromanaging culture, with no diversity at all but all asian managers and employees. There has been a while when several leadership kept repeating ""doing the right things"", ""open door policy"" ""no politics here"" as there might has be some legal issues arising, but they didn't really mean it as they are very political and not being honest. They don't really accept ""challenging the status quo"" and manage up. I have seen many people don't have psychological safety to voice up and worry about backfire among different teams, people have different opinions with the leadership and eventually had to leave due to repercussion, from junior level to VP level, and I've also heard other people moved from finance to accounting and got burned out. Burnout is rampant as teams are under resourced and not supported by management. Higher level employees can bully lower level employees like throw tantrum on them when they are stressed. Managers didn't really want to help employees succeed and develop their careers but want them just keep working. Nepotism and favoritism is very popular in my team if you can be an upper management people pleaser. Career development can be very hard as managers don't know how to hire the right people, and they hire unqualified people and let the whole team suffer. Managers won't do much to low performance employees as long as they are managers' pleaser. It's also hilarious that they keep enforcing RTO but a lot of high level finance leadership and even HR are telecommuter who are located from nowhere and never go to the office. They don't embrace diversity and inclusion. You can survive if you know how to playing games or a working machine."

The health insurance plan is particularly noteworthy, as it covers 100% for employees. While there may be some cost-sharing for family coverage, the company still contributes significantly towards it. Additionally, the 401k matching program is a valuable perk, helping employees save for retirement. These benefits demonstrate the company's commitment to supporting the financial well-being and security of its employees.","As a full-time employee, it's important to maintain a healthy work-life balance. However, in this company, the workload can be overwhelming, even in a hybrid work setup that was intended to provide flexibility. It seems that the wellness hours, particularly on Fridays, are not respected, and there is a possibility of being asked to work on evenings and weekends.

Bloomberg,3,45167,Used to be better,Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","London, England",#NAME?,"- since they drank the scrum koolaid, micromanagement has worsened and it’s night on impossible to be entrepreneurial or innovative except for very limited and managed one day a fortnight “10% time” - pointless return to office is being enforced with no exceptions or consideration for train strikes, childcare needs, etc. despite the last 3 years having proven the teams can work just as effectively (if not more in many cases) remotely. - return to office is slowly creeping up from 3 days to 4 every week. - no justification or explanation given for RTO, it’s just “policy” - hypocrisy of big internal marketing signs and slogans up marketing “Bring your kids to work day by Bloomberg Working Families Community” while at the same time being told the small work from home allowance left is explicitly not to be used for childcare emergencies or needs, and talk of “the days of seeing kids in the background of zoom calls” being over (I mean how petty can you get - we want to pretend our workers are automatons who aren’t humans with lives outside work, so we can’t even see traces of any humanity or children- you must appear a corporate drone at all times). - Disastrous loss of morale with the RTO attitude and hypocrisy."
Bloomberg,3,45303,Mostly a good place to work if you are in the right team...,Sales,Current Employee,"London, England","Very good benefits, amazing office, travel for business in absolute comfort, very good pay and increases, global mobility, absolute job security, access to cultural events, plenty opportunities to move within the firm to other areas.","Micro-management, No WFH flexibility (1 day allowed, soon to be removed altogether) and they would have you in the office 24/7/365 if they were allowed. Long working hours 8-6. Different rules across teams and leniency towards female staff, males have to beg for, and not get, the same privileges female staff receive without question. Poor management and leadership from team leaders who have zero power (everything driven from management many levels above) or know-how to make decisions or manage a team - they are mostly yes men. Enterprise products usually inferior and a lot more expensive than competitors, with zero room for negotiations which puts strain on business relations."
Bloomberg,3,45160,Draconian approach to remote work,Editor,Current Employee,"London, England","- Decent pay, especially when you first start - Some level of job stability compared to other media owners - Lots of perks (free snacks and things - not the kind that constitute company culture)","- The big one is the return to the office. Bloomberg is making all employees come in for 4 days a week. Never mind that many of us are more productive when working from home, never mind that the office is so big it takes 10 minutes just to get a coffee and another 10 to go to the bathroom, never mind that the office has so few meeting rooms it's impossible to get a private space for client calls and meetings, never mind that employees are happier and healthier when they don't have to get up at the crack of dawn to commute into an office, never mind that neurodivergent colleagues struggle to concentrate with the noise and lights of the office environment, never mind that there's a cost of living crisis and it costs thousands extra per year to travel in and out, never mind that the planet's on fire and commuting causes more emissions even though Bloomberg supposedly cares so much about climate change. They just want us in the office! And the worst thing is, they won't even be honest about why. As a consequence, a lot of us are looking for other jobs - which I suspect is the goal. - It's also a very flat structure so there isn't much chance of progression - A lot of middle management have been hanging around for 5, 10, 15 or even 20 years. They do nothing and leave the work to everyone else, whilst openly hoping for a redundancy payout."
Bloomberg,2,45323,Avoid if you can,Analytics and Sales,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",,#NAME?,"- Long hours and glorified version of customer support

Depending on the team, you need to code in fortran and work on solaris/aix machines that vscode does not even support. - Lots of internal tech which are not pleasant to use. Almost nothing related to the Bloomberg terminal is mordern. - Development workflow is extremely lagging for lots of teams. No CI/CD, no linting, no formatter, no docker. Your service will run on a barebone vm instance. Be ready to spend lots of time on figuring out how to build and ship your code. - Most teams adopt the scrum methodology so expect daily standups. Some teams have standups like 2-3 times a week. - Opaque performance evaluation and salary bump. People say there is a magic formula to determine your salary increase. - You badge in/out time show up on your profile and after your email address."

Bloomberg,2,45316,"Pay Is Decent, But Don't Expect To Learn Anything Valuable",Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","New York, NY",#NAME?,"- Coworkers are pretty mediocre and do not care about quality.
- The brightest people who actually care tend to be new-grads who don't know how bad things are because it's their first job.
- Things are done in the most backwards way possible, no real technical leadership (imagine layer upon layer upon layer of tech debt spanning decades) .
- There is an insane amount of process to do the most simple of things, like pushing a Docker image to a repository requires submitted numerous tickets, privileging oneself, etc, likely a day or two of process just to run a single command.
- Bloombergers seem to pride themselves on doing things the backwards way, with onboarding material conditioning new-hires to expect doing things the backwards way (""Don't bring up how your past company did it, we do things differently at Bloomberg!"" ... so you don't care how other companies do this because ... why?)
- Do no expect to use common industry-wide practices, tech, etc. You will use old, outdated tech, libraries, practices.
- As a result, you will learn Bloomberg-only skills and you won't be as hireable at other companies.
- They dogfood the Bloomberg Terminal everywhere; instead of using normal software like Slack, a normal email client, etc., you have to use 1980s technology (the Bloomberg terminal), which runs in a Windows VM and crashes (literally) 4+ times a day.
- Minimum of 2 years before you can change teams. I was hired for one thing and they put me into a different role I have 0 interest in doing which is detrimental to my career.
- They're oddly cheap about a lot of things; no free lunch, the snacks they do provide are simple things like Doritos.
- Laptops are old and worn out with a long process to get something not 3+ years old.
- The company is so big that decisions are made from non-stakeholders on the other side of the company who have no clue what is going on."

Buracratic non-sense is real (even if they try to argue it's not). Office is new and modern, but kinda lifeless. 90% of the time, no food. When there is food, it was a bowl of soup, and ppl line up 100 ft waiting 5 minutes, feels very depressing. The ""values"" just feel like a bunch of fluff to make everyone feel good and feel like theyre doing a good thing. The Bloomberg Philanthropy is a lot about the PR. It all kinda feels dystopian. There's not enough room for everyone to get ahead (naturally, not their fault). To get ahead, you'd need to spend years (even if they say you dont need to) just bc there are no positions available. And... there will be others just as good as you who are qualified. The terminal is old and annoying. It's cool at first, but it gets old real fast. You never actually learn how to use the terminal like a finance guy. There's no real training/on-boarding to teach you the Bloomberg ecosystem (which is important)."

Don't trust HR or any Diversity Advocate / outside agencies / charities. Especially if they say its anonymous. They are all there to protect the company in case of litigation / media attention. 
Get a lawyer/solicitor instead.

All comes from the founder, Micheal Bloomberg.
No surprise he came up with stop-and-frisk, which was then copied by the UK with stop-and-search."

Bloomberg,4,45277,Mixed feeling about the company but can’t complain as it could be so much worse for my skill sets,Sales,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","London, England","- higher salary relative to the industry, see cons for reasons. 

- even if you don’t meet the quotas, if you have good reasons, they will take those into consideration (your customer going out of business for example). 

- envious office. 

- relatively easy work. 

- middle of the pack get the most benefits.

- your interpersonal, tertiary, non transferable skills are tested at great length.

- rarely fire people unless you are consistently at the bottom.

- freedom to make your own calendar.

- founder owned, everyone else just employee.

- there is brand value that originates from the 80s and muscle power. 

- your salary increases with the number of years you are with the company.

- abilities to run your own campaigns and ignore to a great extent campaigns imposed by management because they don’t apply or work in your region/customer types.","- long hours (contracted hours are at least 25% more than industry average) with no flexibility. If you adjusted the hours, the pay would be on par with competitors. 

- if you are a high performer, they will find something you didn’t do well and punish you (same doesn’t apply to those in the middle of the pack)

- no innovation or new products (this is the biggest turn off for me). Terminal is our greatest strength and at the same time greatest constraints hence weakness. 

- meeting for the sake of meeting

- always need to manage managers not customers (great showmanship required)

- when they do fire, absolutely no mercy, they will fire by the minimum legally required standards which translate into at best couple of weeks of your salary (even if you worked there for 10+ years or longer, even if you are a manager). 

- never have enough time for you to explore other career paths in your spare time.

- after 10 years, you might end up with not much tangible skills if at all.

- a lot of vanity projects like deliberate D&I or industry events."

Culture and people is good.","The company preaches that you are paid according to the market but in reality only your salary curve may be similar to the market. Your actual base salary is usually 30% below market. Salary increases and performance bonuses are poor regardless of how well you perform or even how well the company performs. Promotions? If you really like what you do and are trying to get a promotion within the same role, forget about it. Not going to happen. Only way to land a promotion is moving internally to a different role but then, HR is able to see your current salary and will cap your salary increase to keep you really low within your new salary curve. Last but not least, every 12-18month the company goes through re-orgs that usually focus on cost saving and translates to work force reductions."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise | HPE,3,45286,"Good company if your college age or connected, not 30+","Director, Business Development","Former Employee, more than 10 years","Tampa, FL","Perks, culture, etc. is some of the best in the industry","Every 12-18 months, the company undergoes a ""reorganization"" aimed at redirecting priorities and reducing costs. While skills and performance are cited, these reorgs disproportionately target higher-paid, veteran employees. The real intent is to cut costs not really care about their veteran employees.

I was with the company for 25 years before being released due to a recent reorg. My department lost funding and could not maintain my salary - one of the highest due to my tenure. No other departments could take on my compensation either.

This pattern indicates a strategy of replacing experienced, skilled employees with entry-level hires purely to cut costs. While legal, it systematically pushes out veteran expertise. Employees should be aware that loyalty and performance may not protect against being cut solely due to higher salaries.

The company could be more transparent about the financial motivations behind these reorgs. And it risks losing critical institutional knowledge and skills. While some cost-cutting may be necessary, there are likely better ways to achieve savings while valuing and retaining essential experience."
