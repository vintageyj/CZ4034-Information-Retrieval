Robert Bosch,4,3-Feb-24,Internship & working student job in Feuerbach,Full Stack Developer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Stuttgart,"- Good transport connections
- Supervisor always had confidence in students and encouraged them to contribute their own ideas
- Good pay
- Good opportunity to gain experience with new technologies (Oracle database, Jira, Red Hat OpenShift, ...)
- Good canteen food","- Many (mostly unnecessary for my area of responsibility) compliance trainings (partially introduced as a response to Dieselgate)
- No home office (at least before Corona) for interns & working students
- Old office
- Company computers run only Windows (i.e., no Macs) with very restrictive configuration (installation of Google Chrome, for example, was only possible with my supervisor's approval)
- Internal hosting of web applications is outsourced to employees in India who were overwhelmed by many technical problems
- Partly unmotivated colleagues (early retirement, partial retirement & severance payments were frequent discussion topics among the german workforce)
- Not the best prospects (Feuerbach site) due to the transition to e-mobility"
Robert Bosch,2,30-Jan-24,Industry average,Software Engineer,Former Employee,Ho Chi Minh City,"Bosch shows a great example of what a multinational organization is, and how multi-level management is arranged. 
Working at Bosch provides opportunities to work with expats.
Since Bosch is an average performer, working here shows a glimpse into the software industry -> a good career starter for most.
Salary is average.
Functional equipment.
Mixed background workforce.
Bosch's contracts in Vietnam are mostly mediocre (standard), but I luckily landed a great one, so all great.","Most frameworks used are either internal - which means knowledge is non-transferable - or extremely dated which also means the same thing.
Most Boschers are literally code monkeys with really high specialism but relatively weak in term of managerial prowess.
Poor English overall, in all divisions.
Offices are really muted and unmotivating.
Career opportunities is sufficient.
Continuous propagandas about Bosch displayed and mentioned by low-tier managers."

There's always some new machinery to check out, you've just got to argue with the production engineers a bit to be able to see it.","""Youthful team"" is a great buzzword, but most departments were staffed with 30-35 year olds that acted like old farts. Curiously the guys over 50 were the best to be around, because they didn't give a single f anymore on a comical level. Every process is riddled with useless steps that were introduced by grifters, just so they could delay actual work with paper pushing."
Robert Bosch,1,13-Feb-24,Very disappointing and toxic workplace,Digital Expert,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Budapest,"German brand
Good market position and product portfolio","Recruiting will promise good salary and benefits and later you learn it was not true
Very toxic leadership - The international team plays games with each other and normal employees are suffering
They have a ""This is not a democracy"" policy and decide over matters concerning employees
Very bad salary expectations and annual raises are half of the inflation.
German strategy and tactics are made for the German market so it is hard to perform in Balkan countries."

Robert Bosch,1,18-Oct-23,Don't join JMP!,Junior Managers Program (JMP),"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Budapest,"The new office in Budapest is nice, but it lacks a personal touch. Too big, feels like a modern way of keeping slaves.","You go through 6 rounds of interviews, including a personality test, which takes a long time. HR promises you everything, and reality settles in shortly after you join. They lie about the contract, fail to mention important details and deny to address them once you sign. The whole concept of JMP in Hungary is flawed. HR hires for positions where receiving departments have no headcount but would like some. It's a mentor roulette - HR sells the whole program as a great opportunity, with you taking the lead on setting up your stage plan (4x6 months rotation plan) with the help of your mentor - only for this to turn out to be false. My rotation plan was already set in stone, and my so-called ""mentor"" was not interested in my needs or opinion, only their own. If you get a mentor who sucks, you're stuck with them for 4 years. They will try to intimidate and blackmail you into staying, and if you decide to speak up honestly, they will fire you - just like it happened to me. Currently, about 80% of JMPs leave Bosch after the program ends. Senior management does not care about JMP as they are too occupied with investigating whether employees pay for all items at the restaurant. If you're okay with being a corporate lapdog and keeping your mouth shut, feel free to choose Bosch Hungary."

TikTok,1,20-Dec-23,Don't work here,Cash Management Specialist,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Los Angeles, CA","Free food, snacks, and gym","Right from the beginning, the job I was hired for never indicated in their job requirements that Mandarin was needed. On my first day, I come to learn that all training documents are in Mandarin, all the group chats for my team are in Mandarin, and the system that I am working on 90% of the time is completely in Mandarin. There was also little to no onboarding, so I had to hit the ground running with what little Mandarin I knew. 


Being only 1 of 2 people in North America in my team (the rest are in China), it meant that any help or questions I had could only be routed to this team member, who was extremely unhelpful and hostile. It almost felt like I was a threat or burden to her, so all questions about how to do certain things were met with questions back (ie. ""Does this make sense?"" or ""What do you think?"").

After bringing concerns of this to my director, I was gaslit and told that the job did ask for someone with proficiency in Mandarin. I threw the copy of the job description (nowhere did it indicate Mandarin was required) in their face and called it quits from there.

tl;dr - Don't work here. Extremely toxic environment that revolves about the people in China (who are the ones who make decisions), a lot of gaslighting, and the working culture is horrendous."
TikTok,1,6-Feb-24,Covert Racism,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Austin, TX",Pay and benefits are in alignment with most tech roles.,"If you are not a white male you will not be allowed to promote within TikTok. Most, if not all senior leadership have no experience working with other black leaders thus creating consistent bias in their perceptions and reviews of black talent. Look at TikTok's structure and question why the white employees are promoted to higher levels of leadership within 1-2 years while black leaders and employees are off boarded within the same time frame consistently. Hiring other minorities within the company is not a way to ignore the underrepresentation of African American leaders. Most of the decisions do in fact roll down from China with the disguise of other leaders making the decisions. These leaders are not based in the US either. Promotions are for those who talk a lot with no proof of impact."
TikTok,1,13-Nov-23,Chinese bureaucracy - low pay and morale,Client Solutions Manager,Current Employee,,- You get a stable paycheck - Snacks are decent when they're available - People seem nice on the surface for small talk,"- Top down leadership that enforces whatever comes down from leadership in China. No surprise there but don't expect to have a voice in the company - No career growth opportunities unless you want to play politics by constantly shouting out people and ""proving value"" by going way above and beyond your job. Good luck with that given the workload everyone faces. - Rapidly growing yet internal processes and headcount is insufficient. Expect long hours at sub-par pay given the stress and constantly moving goalposts - Forced RTO has been increasing across the industry, but Tiktok is quickly going from 3 to 4 by next year, and it's only a matter of time until 5. Tracked by badge swipes showcases no trust because at the end of the day, leadership just wants people in seats. - Silent layoffs. People have been cut in small groups with no mentions by leadership or team meetings. Overall, I would truly not recommend working here unless you have no other alternatives. Constant change mixed by people working in silos, beholden to any sudden changes by leadership, and morale continues to tank. We have some smart people here but it's quickly becoming evident that this is a sinking ship, and that's not even factoring in the political landscape."

Constant re-orgs on a monthly basis, randomly shifting who reports to who based on who speaks Mandarin and who is in the pocket of leadership. Treats other companies horribly and bullies them to always get what TikTok wants. Entire focus is on pushing Shops, which is not working and advertisers don't want to use because they do not trust the company (as they shouldn't). They bait and switch every program to get advertisers to trust the platform but the long term vision is to become Douyen and Star Maps and cut out any competition in the market."
TikTok,1,22-Dec-23,Worst Company with hostile work environment,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,Maybe free lunch and dinner,"Worked for over a year and the team I worked for, backstabbed me and I lost my job because of the evil team and immature and evil management and the corrupted HR. The manager was the worst and most unprofessional manager I have ever worked for. This is not a made-up story, the environment is extremely toxic, controlled by CN based people and too much politics and backstabbing. They expect you to work 12+ hours like a slave. There is absolutely no empathy, sympathy for the employees especially if you have family / kids. 
If the company feels like you will open the facts to the public or complain (saying the truth), they will throw you in a S..hole. They make your life so miserable that you have no other choice but to quit. They use the performance review technique to give you a poor performance score that puts you on a one-month probation which you either need to resign or they will fire you anyways. 

Don't fall for the name and fancy stuff you hear, this is not a place you want to work, you will regret your life."

Firstly, the concept of work/life balance seems non-existent. Meetings commence at 7:00 pm and often extend until 10:00 pm due to the involvement of many colleagues based in China.

The organizational mentality deviates significantly from what one might encounter in a Western workplace. Recognition for excellent work is not a norm; it's considered a part of your responsibilities. However, any inability to complete the numerous day-to-day tasks is met with blame rather than constructive feedback.

An additional critical success factor here is proficiency in Chinese/Mandarin. This requirement goes beyond language barriers; it extends to the importance of networking within the company."

TikTok,2,13-Oct-23,Sad to say this but in my experience there is a consistent & underlying pattern of gaslighting,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"- THE PEOPLE. People who work there are genuinely so talented and nice. That's why I and, I think most people stay(ed). - Its awesome when having a @tiktok.com email opens any doors or inbox to you - Its an awesome brand and the product is exceptional - Great events, very unreliable but cool swag - Many of the leaders are genuinely awesome","- There is a pattern of consistent and underlying gaslighting at TikTok that I have witnessed over my many years working there. I think this is largely driven by poor HR practices. You see this cascade through levels of management where leaders and individual HR members are complicit in continuing it down to their directs & stakeholders in order to do a good job at their roles and keep discontent from employees at a minimum.Examples of this: convincing employees that they are wrong when they come with comp concerns, setting unachievable goals or moving the goal posts, changing policies that they'd previously indicated, over-relying on top performers to carry teams but not rewarding them, giving individuals management roles but stripping their autonomy to make decisions at it applies to their business, leaders who aren't really making decisions but are having decisions dictated to them - Culture of individual self promotion externally - Comp & benefits is truly subpar, the current stock buy back program is evidence of this. ByteDance already devalued RSUs for employees last year to ""make the company more attractive to future hires"" and has further devalued stocks by offering a different buyback price for former employees than current. Their value just keeps getting lower and lower. I genuinely think many people hold on because they keep hoping it'll pay off rather than just cutting bait on something that's actually becoming less valuable over time - The ""360"" performance review isn't real and it takes most people about 3 review rounds to see that. Your success is determined by your manager, their sway, their results, whether or not they like you, and the overall forced distribution - Performance review is used as a chance to change the levels of employees who have been ""promoted"" in the middle of the period, rather than actually reward high performance - No merit increases. Your performance ""raises"" or any raise from a role change (unlikely to happen) slowly get eaten up by inflation. It's very difficult to tangibly increase your comp - Pockets of bad bad lack of work life balance"

The company culture and ideals are generally more evolved, diverse, and more relaxed than the usual kind of corporate set up which I'm thankful for particularly given the nature of the work, even if the company does at times too much hark on this sort of fake cool corporate family vibe. Still, the people I work with are nice and there is some attention paid to mental health (although often inadequate).","The nature of the work is often tedious even if it's rarely boring and watching hateful and violent videos on an hourly constant is not great for anyone’s mental health and the company (like most big corporations) are a little flippant in regard to that toll on employees but attempt to put up a good front with what are ultimately mediocre benefits and incentives. I'm also not too excited that the company has recently caught the dreaded RTO bug that's been going around, but I guess I should not be surprised that capitalist ableism wins out yet again.

TikTok,1,29-Nov-23,STAY AWAY FROM this toxic place,Strategy Manager,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","San Francisco, CA","pays well, but you are over worked. So it doesn't really pay that well.","The most toxic place I've ever been. Here's my experience as one data point. 
1. Manager A, whom I've been working together with for more than half a year. Every one-on-one session is basically me providing additional tutoring to him. There's no planning or contribution to my work from him, not even a sense of direction. He doesn't offer any input, leaving me to conceptualize the scope for each bimonthly project on my own. He neither supports nor opposes any proposals I put forward. If I succeed, he takes credit; if I fail, it's on me. Throughout this period, he hasn't contributed anything. He doesn't assess my work independently but relies on the opinions of people from a parallel department. Resources are always said to be ""in the process of negotiation,"" but in reality, they are not provided. I've interviewed dozens of candidates, and some promising ones get stuck when they reach him. I don't understand why, if we're not hiring, why wasting so much time of mine, the recruiter's, and the candidates'. I have no idea what he's busy with; he has never produced any results himself. When asked, he claims other areas need him to put out fires.

2. Clearly lacking top-down direction, Manager A says I ""lack entrepreneurship."" At this point, my mind is clear, and I find it amusing. I manage four or five projects simultaneously, discovering opportunities, designing, and executing them on my own. Yet, he says I lack entrepreneurship.

3. For the past half-year, I've been working overloaded, 14-16 hours a day. Being in the U.S. West Coast, I need to collaborate with teams in China, attending meetings at 5:30 am, 6:30 am, and often extending meetings until at least 10 pm during weekdays. Meetings frequently go into the early hours of the morning, and I still have to do my own work afterward.

4. After more than half a year, Manager A brings in Manager B. This person has no relevant experience whatsoever, not even remotely related.

5. I end up tutoring B for almost a month, explaining the situation to them. I don't want to dwell on why this person became my boss; I'm just relieved to have someone to share the workload.

6. A month later, I ask B about her plans for my work as my boss. B says, ""Just go with the flow, take it easy."" Then, she turn around and tell Manager A that I'm not in good shape, not actively working.

7. B assigns me to lead a project, let's call it Project Z. Anyone with experience would know this project is impossible to complete. During the planning phase, I point out that both internal and external conditions for this project are not mature, suggesting we wait until they are more favorable. B insists on proceeding. Since B doesn't listen to advice, I reluctantly follow her instructions, and the results are naturally not satisfactory. Later, two different people took over Project Z, one resigns after a few weeks, and the other transferred to a different team. (It's clear that the insistence on doing project Z was A and B's problem.) Eventually, Project Z becomes the sole basis for B to claim that my ""judgment is lacking.""

8. B openly wants me to leave. The reason is, ""My team cannot have two senior people,"" and the next day she said, ""My team can have two senior people, but you are not suitable."" However, due to visa issues, I can't resign immediately. So, I'm witness some more horror.

9. My relationship with the counterpart team has always been good. This is why, even when it was tough, I persisted in this position before B arrived. One day, B requests that I stop having one-on-one meetings with people from the counterpart team. She told me ""Don't attend these meetings"" (but those were meetings organized by me), and ""Don't have one-on-ones with XX.""

10. After another month, Both managers, along with HR, tell me that my performance is poor. The main accusations are ""lack of judgment"" and ""trust with the collaborating team cannot be repaired."" At this point, because I haven't had direct contact with the collaborating team for over a month, I start doubting myself. After talking to several people from the collaborating team, I realize that this is completely baseless nonsense.

11. B says I have a ""perfectionist tendency and am not suitable for this environment."" Unable to come up with anything substantial, they repeatedly criticize my personality, making vague and ambiguous remarks. When I ask for specific work-related examples, they accuse me of being defensive (attacking my attitude, attacking my personality, refusing to discuss work)."

DXC Technology,2,24-Jan-24,HR sucks,IT Technician II,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Philadelphia, PA",Experience in industry. Working with large companies,Mostly every aspect of the job is a con. No member of management really seemed to care for your well-being. Penalized for having hospital emergency and had HR meeting to find ways to deal with my poor attendance even though it was 2 sick days and one hospital visit. Many people quit without notice because of poor treatment from HR. My direct manager was a good man. Everyone else in the chain was very rude at every interaction. Was given 2x original work duties as reward for my good work. No extra compensation associated with it and nothing to show for it. They have a reward system in place but it was strongly biased to client facing employees. So many of the harder working employees never saw any rewards for their work. While one single employee would receive rewards multiple times each week.
DXC Technology,1,21-Dec-23,Bad Managment ,JEE Web & Middleware,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Sofia, Sofia (city)",No Pros from the management during the most economy hard times in the world.,"I would like to share my feedback regarding my tenure at DXC Technology, where I worked for nearly three years across four different projects simultaneously.

During my time at DXC, there were numerous instances where concerns were raised during meetings, particularly by Peter Mrazik, regarding the unavailability of bonuses and the removal of the merit process. These discussions were often delivered in a less-than-ideal tone, which, in my view, contributed to a less positive work environment.

In addition, despite my commitment to putting in many hours of overtime, my recognition was limited to occasional expressions of appreciation, and after nearly three years of dedicated service, I received a modest 10 percent salary increase. This was not reflective of the significant effort I put into my work and the multiple projects I managed concurrently.

Furthermore, there seemed to be a disconnect between the information shared in direct manager meetings, which consistently conveyed a positive outlook for the company, and the financial statements released every quarter, which indicated a less optimistic reality. This disparity raised concerns about transparency and communication within the organization.

One of the public discussions that raised eyebrows was the decision by Peter Mrazik to halt promotions, allegedly due to personal preferences against promotions in Bulgaria. Meanwhile, it was disheartening to learn that our direct managers were reportedly receiving bonuses based on the money saved by the company, which appeared to be incongruent with the challenges faced by the employees."
DXC Technology,3,25-Jan-24,Sometimes great sometimes a nightmare,Senior Business Analyst,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",,"I worked with some truly spectacular colleagues, oh some fascinating projects. I learned a great deal. Colleagues were mostly very open and supportive. Management mostly gets out of the way and lets you do. your thing.","In almost 5 years I got a 3% pay raise. Not per year. TOTAL. VERY stingy raises. I was promised a promotion for a year by FOUR different managers. It never happened. Then they laid me off claiming there was no business.

I worked with a lot of great people at DXC but the pay is below par, opportunities for advancement are few and 6 years on, DXC is still dealing with the fallout from the CSC/HPE merger in ways that hamper the company with things large and small."
DXC Technology,2,29-Nov-23,I would not recommend working here,Senior Computer Operator,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Tulsa, OK","The people who worked beside you are really great and helpful when on the job. 
The direct supervisors were not only helpful when learning new things, they are also have a wealth of knowledge.
The pay was decent.","The upper management doesn't care at all about the employees.
Upper management will often force decisions down that you know are bad for the system. Even if you voice your concerns, they don't care.
They've had to duct tape the system together so much that nothing is consistent. This is because of TPF changing over the years, but also because of upper managements lack of foresight.
The hours are horrible. A rotating 7 day schedule isn't easy to do.
TPF is going out of the IT world pretty soon. So learning anything about it won't benefit you very much outside of a very niche market.
There's no opportunities to move up in the company because upper management won't hire new employees.
They recently announced that they were having ""financial issues"". Due to this, management has forced down cost cutting measures and put off hiring much needed help for the desk."

However, I only know this via rumors, since I myself haven't spoken with anyone that has received anything for the whole history of the company (since the merge that created the company on 2017), I haven't received or seen anyone receive any merit increase. This is despite being consistently graded on my performance reviews with good results, including the last 3 years being among the top performers. The last time this was discussed on a town hall the CEO got mad, because of people questioning and confronting him about the topic, and was the last we heard of him for literally years, until he was replaced, a few weeks ago.
- You might lose your job at any moment. Unfortunately, the only consistent strategy this company has to make the bottom line and appease shareholders is cost reduction via layoffs. This is done without regard of your performance and most of the time whether or not your job is needed or not, regardless of any impact for your client.
- It seems this company exists only to make their top executives richer: Look up a Register article, ""Despite declines, DXC Technology boss awarded $20.3m in 2023"", cannot paste the link here due to GD policies."

high turnover of employees and management
difficult to connect with other departments even when onsite
constant rolling layoffs 
no raises
Excessively high insurance plans with low coverage even when purchasing the highest available tier

This was my first official IT role after deciding to pivot from the commercial airline industry to IT so I didn't know what to expect. 

I also only stayed as long as I did to the COVID shutdown and not wanting to job hunt during that time. The vast majority of my coworkers were former military, which led to a lot of solid SMEs and structure in the dept when I 1st began, but I soon realized the issues of this place was due to a poorly executed corporate merger. The processes in place and communication were just poor. I know mergers can take years (I've experienced three with previous companies), but this one seemed to be excessively poorly planned. Promises were constantly being reneged on. Some employees ended up filing lawsuits due to this. I was hired but did not start the actual role until 6 months later, which was bizarre considered all the security clearances I already had. I stayed because I really wanted experience working with DOD contract companies. Most people hired found other jobs and never actually started. I used that time to wrap up a business that failed during COVID and get some IT certs. I think the company culture in general wasn't great before the merger at HPES and does not seem to be restricted to certain departments. CSC was definitely the more employee centric company before merging with Hewlett Packard ES to form DXC.
Once I found a better role and the covid restrictions were lifted, I left."

Everyone I interviewed with was extremely polite, patient, and knowledgeable and gave me a fantastic initial impression of the company.

From a technical perspective, the internal software architecture of PayPal is a mess. In addition to being the most siloed organization I’ve ever seen, there are far too many individual services that make up their system. This has the side effect of making even the simplest debugging or coding task almost impossible for any new hire from outside of PayPal to accomplish, regardless of their technical ability. Without at least several years of PayPal proprietary domain knowledge, you will be woefully unequipped to deal with most tasks you are given. The only preparation you have in this regard is a litany of online documents to review during your first few weeks, most of which are very detailed, but still cannot give you enough perspective to understand PayPal’s overly complex flows.

With regard to management, despite knowing the complexities mentioned above and how difficult they are to understand for new hires, they don’t seem to really care when it comes to allocating your tasks. You will likely be overloaded with tasks that you clearly aren’t well equipped to deal with yet, and your manager will likely just ask you to handle it anyway. On top of this, there seems to be a culture of trying to shift blame and “kick the can” around to different teams for incidents regardless of what the data says."

PayPal,3,6-Oct-23,A constant shining star that’s lost its luster,Principal Engineering Manager,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","San Jose, CA","For the first 4 of the 6 years I worked there, PayPal was a place that strove to do the right thing even if it was hard. It was a place of growth and learning and opportunity.","In the last 2 years of my tenure, it had become increasingly toxic inside. The pandemic turned it from a job or good work life balance into excessively long work hours and high turnover. I managed two charters with over 50 people working for me. I stayed as long as I could stand it, for them. By the time I left all I needed was anything else less toxic. I’ve heard of only little improvement. It’ll be another few years before the company can start to do the right thing again for its people, let alone its customers. And that’s if they work for it."
PayPal,5,5-Sep-23,Great Company,"Sr Manager, Marketing","Current Employee, more than 3 years","Timonium, MD","I love working at PayPal. The people are smart, hard-working and care about one another. The company treats employees really well and has amazing insurance and PTO. The work is interesting and solves real life problems that most people can understand. I'm motivated by working on products I use and love in real life and I really love the company's overall mission.","The company can't seem to align on a larger strategic vision. Lots of re-orgs and changes that are really disruptive and make it hard to just get things done. If you don't like process, this is not your place. Every team and org within the business uses their own tools- what seems like it should take 30 mins ends up taking 3 days. If you want fast, don't work here."
PayPal,1,16-Dec-23,Toxic developer culture of non-cooperation,Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,"The pay and benefits are good, vacation time is untracked, and you're unlikely to ever get heat for anything because there's very little accountability","All I can say is that PayPal suffers from an intransigent culture of non-cooperation among development groups. Every piece of vital development, deployment, and project nanagement infrastructure is (GitHub, Jira, Jenkins, Slack, Node.js, and on and on) is completely siloed, and the team running within that silo is far more interested in keeping everyone else out of that silo than they are in cooperating for the common good of development teams.

If you ever have a suggestion or a request for a change to one of these infrastructure items, whether it's a direct necessity for one of your project requirements or just something you thought of that would benefit the development experience of everyone using it, the team running that silo will put a truly impressive amount of time and energy into preventing it from happening. They generally go down this ladder of stonewalling tactics:

- Make it as difficult as possible to find out what team is managing the item in question
- Make it as difficult as possible to contact anyone on that team
- When contacted, avoid responding to the inquiry
- When forced to respond by upper management or public pressure, explain how team policy makes it impossible to implement the request (and hope they don't remember that your team policy is self-imposed)
- Perpetually claim to be understaffed. Luckily, it doesn't matter how many dedicated team members you actually have, because nobody will ever call you out for not really being understaffed.
- When some new VP of something or other joins the company and decides to implement a major change and it's all hands on deck, claim you are currently dedicating all resources to that VP's new pet project, regardless of whether your team actually has any connection to the project.
- If all of the above still fails to deter other teams from making requests or suggestions, then just stop responding to them. There is no escalation procedure for interteam conflicts that reaches anyone with any actual authority, so no team is ever held accountable for refusal to cooperate with other teams."

Qualcomm,2,1-Feb-24,Review - Qualcomm,Test Technician,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","San Diego, CA",#NAME?,"-Corporate environment, no visibility to upper management to showcase hard work or credentials.
-Titles are meaningless here, it is very hard to get promoted and to get promoted it likely means you have networked more with staff than proven your worth.
-Future outlook on your job is very unstable with layoffs and temporary employees that come in for a few months and their contract is not extended - in essence, it sucks when people you think are very productive and smart are taken away from the team and then you have to pick up the slack.
-No merit increases for all employees in 2024, a lot of the work is getting outsourced to Taiwan, India, and Mexico so employees seem disposable to management."

The environment used to be one where hard work and creativity were recognized and rewarded, contributing to a vibrant and productive culture.

Lately, however, the atmosphere has shifted. The rise in office politics has made it increasingly difficult for individual achievements to shine through. Remote work, while flexible, has introduced challenges in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, with late-night calls and meetings becoming the norm. This has made it tough to disconnect and recharge, impacting personal time and overall well-being.

Moreover, there’s a growing trend towards relocating projects to the India team and layoffs for cost-saving reasons. While understanding the financial aspects of business decisions, this move raises concerns about the long-term implications on quality and team dynamics."

Because of this, employees have been conditioned to believe they're the best. They're really quite mediocre yet they act like they are better than others. The management consists of engineers internally promoted into management. Stay there long enough and you become Director, Sr. Director, VP, President, etc. The majority of management has no leadership experience outside of Qualcomm and Qualcomm doesn't value training its management. The result is poor leadership that doesn't understand the importance of diversity of thought. The monetary compensation/benefits (salary, bonus, RSUs) is not as competitive as it used to be. The culture has continually degraded over the last decade. A decade ago there was much more innovation happening at all levels, everyone seemed happy around campus and enjoyed talking to each other, and the company provided much more for the employees. After the major 2015 layoffs people started staying in their offices. The fun seemed gone and has never returned. Many fun innovation initiatives were cut.

Excellent benefits. 15% discount stock plan with a lookback. Fantastic health insurance.","Regular late night and early morning calls with India. Work life balance is poor. 

Targeted layoffs for employees over age 50. They claim they don't discriminate based on age, but if you look around at who gets laid off every cycle.... 

Promotion track is extremely political. The promotion from entry-level to journeyman to mid-level is just based on time in seat, but after 10 years exp, you need to be the right guy's friend to advance. 

Management is promoted internally, which means that nearly every manager and director is either a member of the pre-2010 old boys club or the winner of the latest departmental cage fight. 

Incredible amounts of infighting at the director level. Work teams are sabotaged or outright destroyed by Game of Thrones style politics a level above them. 

No training path for juniors. They are just expected to figure things out themselves. 

Morale is in the toilet. WLB and consistent layoffs have the office feeling like a funeral parlor. 

Offshore teams in India are coming for the San Diego workers' jobs, and the SD employees all know it. 

Zero innovation. The same products just get recycled over and over again. QCOM is stagnant technologically. 

Repetitive work. No real career growth. After staff level, you pretty much either just rest and vest, or start playing politics to get on the promotion track. 

If you join Qualcomm in San Diego, simply plan on being laid off in 3 to 5 years. Either you will tick the wrong guy off, your director will tick the wrong guy off, you will age into the danger zone, or an economic downturn will have the C-Suite offshoring your job to Bangalore."

I took that to heart and took every training opportunity and educational assistance so that I could to keep relevant. 

By my 10 year point, I transitioned to Factory IT Engineering. 

17 years of being on the cutting edge of semiconductor technology and providing the IT services to enable the whole thing, I retired as a Senior IT Engineer.

Great Teams throughout Factory IT.","Long hours, I worked with teams all around the globe. Early morning meetings with Europe, late evening meetings with Asia the same day happened every week.

Late and sometimes no acknowledgement of the work to bring up a new factory. 

The expectation that managing systems in 7 small factories is less impactful than managing systems in a mega-factory."
Intel Corporation,5,23-Jan-24,Love working for Intel,Maintenance Technician,Current Employee,,"In my role, there is a great work life balance, I work compressed shift, meaning I work 3 day 12 hours shift and one week 4 day 12 hours shift.
Great benefits, bonuses each quarter, of course this is predicated on ""earnings"". A standard bonus yearly.
Great match in 401K, Restricted Stock, Employee Stock Purchase 2X a year at 15% discount. Sabbaticals, 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Non-Exempt has floating holidays, which are generally used as vacations. We get 112.5 hours.  
I really love my job.","Recognition is lacking. Adding equipment at a rapid rate and expecting the same amount of people to do the extra work due to hiring freezes. This is leading to burnout.
Ability to take time off. Example I work Shift 5, you can only have a maximum of 2 people off at the same time. The max time you can plan ahead is 90 days. So, you need to have plans ready ahead of time if you need to take off."

World class talent and teams at higher levels of technical ladder. Strong emphasis on cultural aspects like inclusion and diversity, work-life balance (at this site). Generally friendly work environment. Some flexibility in hybrid work model (depending on role). Compensation is competitive for the area, enough to live comfortably.","Sublinear career development, have to be here 10-20 years to get anywhere internally. Seniority valued, esteemed, and promoted more than talent. Compared to higher profile sites in Oregon and Santa Clara, treated like 3rd class citizens in terms of overall compensation and quality of onsite amenities- site heavily hit by cost cutting at the expense of quality of life. Most managers will not go out of their way to help develop your career or you personally, many more task managers than mentor types. Escalation ladder is unhealthy for interpersonal disputes, often encouraged to go straight to HR instead of emphasizing paths through individual and manager level."

Middle management will only get in your way for growth as a lot of manager are there only for their growth and not for the ICs under them. Not all managers are like this but there are enough of them. 

You will get stuck into your role, takes a long time to change area even inside the organization and in comparison, to other semiconductor companies, you get so specialized at something that you are not useful anywhere else. 

Old legacy tools. Organizations are trying to modernize the tools but we are behind about 8 years in easy. Management is hesitant in spending time on improvements.

Non-Merit promotions, most promotions are because of the years that you have been in the company."

There are still many pockets of this kind of culture, though upper management is trying to change it. It would be good to try to get an inside opinion before joining, if possible, so you can avoid the bad groups.

-SOME interesting innovations happening around the company","-Big company = YOU as an individual worker are insignificant to the operation of the corporation; also lots of hierarchy and internal politicking.
-MANY lame projects happening all over the company;
-This ancient giant has been receding in profits thanks in part to their ""fixed-cost"" accounting model (not sure if GAAP or non-GAAP), so the past year plus they've been scheming how to pinch pennies and keep their reported quarterly profits appearing non-negative. Unfortunately, due to said ""fixed-cost"" accounting model, one of the few things they can adjust to reduce forward reported costs is to reduce total company expenditures on compensation, be it through bonus/salary cuts or ""corporate people movement"" of thousands of workers OFF of the payroll and OUT of the company. Rather than fully embracing the rapidly growing trend (and need) for general-purpose CPUs being accelerated by more specialized and efficient co-processors (e.g., FPGAs from that company Altera y'all bought a few years back), Intel's leadership under Pat Gelsinger has decided to press forward at full-steam towards becoming the TSMC of America and Europe, rather than truly compete with the modern Tech Giants of NVIDIA & AMD, who now dominate the processing IP market. Instead, Intel has decided to DIVEST a **non-controlling** stake in the ownership of Former Altera (The Programmable Solutions Group, or PSG, as Intel so cleverly named it with their acquisition) to the public, in order to raise funds for Intel-main; their strategy is to leverage the most profitable pieces of their conglomeration into ""separate"" (but not independent) companies in order to let the public markets support those effective pieces without having to buy into the stagnant INTC main stock. Besides spinning off the useful pieces of the corporation as contractually Intel-dependent side hustles (rather than truly integrating them into core operations), they are also selling them for their ""parts"" so to speak, as they sell off tech campuses which have housed dedicated employees for decades, without a worry in the world for what this might do to their lousy workers' lives and morale. In fact, anyone who doesn't seem up to snuff to handle such rapid and unpredictable changes is ripe for the chopping block, as the company continues to hunt for any excuse they can find to cut more workers from their books. Intel will be looking to hire thousands of ""new"" workers in ""new"" jobs they will create, but don't expect a fancy tech salary, as those will not be offered to the construction and mass Fab roles they will be trying to fill in Ohio and Arizona. Hopefully their CHIPS Act funding doesn't fall through with this next elected cycle of Government...."

Doing similar PM’s everyday can get pretty repetitive and boring. Initial onboarding training is not job specific and about three weeks long.

My family and I get free health insurance that almost covers all routine visits. They are fully reimbursing me my tuition as I work on getting my Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. The factory bonuses are spotty but it does help when they come through.,"If you want to get raises/promotions that actually reflect your experience and that keep up with cost-of-living increases, the only way truly is to change positions by applying for and receiving a new job offer. It's hard to go up by even one pay grade by staying in the same job, while other shifts in your module may be hiring on at one pay grade higher than you. That creates a lot of internal movement and teams are constantly cycling in fresh staff to replace the senior staff who have accepted better offers elsewhere in the company (again, sometimes even just by changing shifts). The career opportunities for growth are there, just not by staying put (ie loyalty to a particular module, which is a shame)."

Your manager is the single biggest influence on your own success, stability, and career. Good manager = good career (converse is also true)","Intel is the 800lb Gorilla in the industry. They do what they want. While they pay lip service to ""employees are the foundation of our success"", that's all they do. Their actual foundation is apparent shareholder value, and their federal gov't contracts.

Good RSU compensation
Depending on the organization & VP you report into, great work-life-balance and meaningful work","Autodesk is constant change of reorgs with VPs departing, orgs being merged, and new VPs arriving. This makes for a fractured company culture and as an employee, its up to you to roll with the changes, often this can make for significant changes to your day-to-day. 

Within PSET (there are a few orgs within Autodesk), there is a top-down leadership culture that is suffocating. Its interesting that Autodesk is considered an innovative company, the pattern over the last few years has been to disempower engineering creativity, push out talented engineers, and replace engineering talent overseas. Cost cutting has been a fixture of Autodesk strategy, not investment in innovation. 

This has created an inefficient engineering culture and a slow pace of delivery. Its recommended to avoid any teams related to the Analytics Data Platform, the VP and the leadership team are unethical and toxic. The VP openly talks about being a 'dictator' (his words), says inappropriate things, often laughs about HR, and plays petty politics. There is a strong vibe that performance is more about 'kissing the ring' than building anything durable and reliable."

I met many of amazing people and had some great mentors to help me grow through the company.,"In the end I had a terrible manager that after 15 years I decided to leave. It was once a company that promoted growth/leadership but over the last 5 years of my time there, it was more about pushing sausage through the factory and just doing what you are told. It lost the creative element I once loved there so I moved on and have been pretty happy so far."
Autodesk,5,11-Nov-23,"Change is hard, but we're well positioned for it!",Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,"In a sea of toxic tech companies, Autodesk remains a uniquely positive and inspiring place to build a career. Goals are lofty and change is a given, but at every level of the org, from the very senior ranks on down, there's a sense that everyone is up for the challenge. Top-down vision from leadership is clearly defined, and a lot of space and opportunity to define the ""how"" if you're willing to raise your hand. A lot of new leadership within our C-suite and VP ranks, particularly in Marketing, charged with driving change and transforming Marketing into a growth engine for the company. Despite that challenging mandate, I've found them to be clear on the vision, comfortable in making challenging decisions, and open to pivoting when new information becomes available. No business transformation is ever easy, but as someone who's been through *many* I've been impressed at the leadership's ability to thread the needle between maintaining the culture that makes Autodesk so great and driving the business forward in a meaningful and uniquely different way.","The culture can be very relationship-driven, and because of this, there are areas in which it can feel quite process immature. Getting better, but still present."
Autodesk,3,28-Sep-23,Culture code does not resonate in all teams,Candidate Support Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","New York, NY","I worked at Autodesk for many years in the Human Resources - PPL department, and I have mixed feelings about my time there. While I had some great colleagues and learned a lot about HR practices, my overall experience ended on a sour note. Great Colleagues: The people I worked with in the HR/CSA team were amazing. Supportive, friendly, and knowledgeable, they made the workplace bearable even during challenging times. Learning Opportunities: I gained valuable experience and skills in HR during my tenure at Autodesk. The company offered numerous opportunities for professional growth.","Laid Off Unfairly: The most significant issue I faced was being laid off due to a restriction and not my job performance. It's disheartening to lose your job when you know you've been doing well. It felt like a slap in the face after years of hard work. Lack of Transparency: The management's communication regarding layoffs was vague at best. It left many of us wondering why we were being let go when there were no prior warnings or discussions about performance issues. Inconsistent Policies: The company's HR policies seemed arbitrary and inconsistent, especially in times of restructuring. It was difficult to understand why some employees were retained while others were let go. Work-Life Balance: HR roles are known for their demanding nature, but the work-life balance at Autodesk was often skewed towards work. Overtime was expected without additional compensation, which further added to the frustration."

Managers with a ""do as I say, not as I do"" (managers and leadership expect individual contributors to adhere to a ""culture code"" but they do not themselves). Constructive feedback comes as a surprise at review time (once a year). Rare positive feedback throughout the year. No growth path or ways to move laterally; you are stuck for years in a role unless the organization changes you to another role. People that have no business being managers are made managers but people that express desire to get there are ignored. Managers are terrible people managers because they are expected to do other things as well - and those other things are what give them ""visibility""."

This is the first place I truly felt ""micro-management"" 4. The metrics used are 100% based on how many issues you resolve and not the severity of the issues. 5. Getting bonuses, etc, different managers have different ways of assigning them, so under one manager I got 95%, and under another, I got 115% - for the same work done. 6.

I'm so much happier since I left 2 years ago. My mental health has greatly improved!

Cons:
- Extreme Micromanagement by the C level senior staff. I had the unfortunate experience of working closely with a C-Level Executive. I was constantly belittled and put down. My boss was a former navy seal so they had a particular mindset, their way or no way. It was extremely toxic and cannot believe I let someone speak to me like that in this day and age. 
- They expect you to work past clocked hours. Also, there were constant unexpected/unscheduled calls to my personal cell phone. Just because I didn't have small children, should NOT give you the permission to call me at 9:00 at night.

It was a truly unpleasant experience and the worst job I ever had. I knew it was time to go after being told the following: 
""You're bad at your job."" (Instead of providing constructive criticism.)
 ""$30,000 doesn't get me up in the morning."" - The God complex was astounding. Then they had the audacity to roll their eyes when I spoke about my experience in a meeting with HR. Extremely rude and unprofessional. I hope they see this and know who they are. :)

I'm now with a company that appreciates me and my boss is wonderful. :)"
VMware,1,3-Nov-23,Tragic turn from great to horrible,Senior UI Developer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Palo Alto, CA",VMware was a great company until recently. They hired some new people and got into the Broadcom acquisition and it all went south - really bad. Pay is still good but that will take a significant hit with Broadcom if the deal ever goes through - in either case VMware will never be the same.,"My team is fine. The devs I work with both here and remote are pretty good but there is too much to do and not enough people.  Unfortunately I work with the design team doing FED for UI. This team was pretty decent until they changed leadership. There are now several foul and horrendous people full of phony warmth and a lot of meaningless process. Designers are burdened with time wasting UX performances that make things hard for them and this trickles down to us. I am very pro-UX when it brings value but this does not. Even worse are the technical people in this group. Along with being unpleasant, full of misery and sadness that turns everything into an unproductive and non-collegial confrontation, they also are straight up unqualified. I have sat in meetings where these people make embarrassing outright errors. Make sure anything you do has ZERO connection with them or you will work in a backstabbing atmosphere of gloom."
VMware,2,13-Sep-23,Low key racist - Favoritism across the board,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Boston, MA","Benefits are awesome. Pays pretty decent for the role. If you’re a remote employee, it can be a little more difficult to get your foot off the ground but a lot of flexibility.","Some of the management shows extreme favoritism. They micromanage, and they don’t like remote employees. I’m only speaking for Cloud health and not VMWare. There is a closet racist at the helm of Cloud health. They are very abusive when you don’t hit your numbers and start to micromanage you they promote their friends and they all hang out together. If you’re in the Boston office, management are friends people leave with an a days notice, and you never know why they give their friends the best territories and then make it your fault that your territory is not the best even though data shows that that territory needs to be white spaced overall good company but if you’re a biopic, not the best place. Unnecessary meetings, and gaslighting when you express concerns."

Of course there are always things you could complain about, but ultimately, VMware pays its employees well, treats everybody with respect, and encourages employees to develop themselves. The company goes out of its way to do nice things for its employees. i'm going to miss VMware and all of the people here once Broadcom destroys the culture and lays off 90% of us.","It's easy to get pigeonholed into a job here, but the company will continue to promote and incentivize you financially to stick with it. There are a lot of tenured directors and senior directors that are in over their heads. Good people, but are not qualified for director level jobs other than having worked their way up at VMware."

I am currently dedicated to one very large account. Pay is commensurable, for the work and the team surrounding me are all top notch.","The biggest downside to VMware as I see it is being acquired by Broadcom. Broadcom is a very flat organization and thus the amount of resources I will have to help with my career going forward will be extremely limited. This not to say that my job is no longer doable, it's just to say that I won't be able to leverage some very talented people anymore in my sales process. I'd like to think that these resource reduce our time to market and time to close while solving business critical problems."
VMware,3,22-Oct-23,Not a visionary company,Staff Performance Engineer,Former Employee,,"VMware is a visionary company in terms of what they are famous for. However, see my comments about working on a product unrelated to what VMware is known for.","VMware is a great company in terms of its primary focus. However, they also have some products that are out of their mainstream. I worked on one of those. The management of this group was completely clueless in terms of the industry, the competition, and the product direction. They have no ambition to make a better product. Instead, they were happy to make a little money based on maintenance revenues from legacy customers. Working in an environment of 2nd and 3rd-rate engineers running on auto-pilot was very frustrating. Had I known this in advance of joining, I would have never signed up."

I'm not normally a fan of corporate reorgs, but this place needs one. You can't drive change in the kind of decentralized organization they have built, which makes working there a pretty big exercise in banging your head against the wall.

Politics above Sr Directors is ridiculous at times. There is a dysfunctional ecosystem among leadership in different teams. The acquisition is affecting morale and the lack of communication down to us is not helping. There is no guarantee that we will get to stay and information related to how VMware aligns to Broadcom’s vision is not clear.

NTT DATA,4,17-Feb-24,Mid level job,Network Engineering Advisor,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Atlanta, GA","Working as a Network Engineering Advisor at this company offers an unparalleled experience with its remote work setup, providing the flexibility to craft your own schedule. The autonomy granted allows for a healthy work-life balance, affording ample time to pursue personal interests. One of the most appealing aspects of this position is the opportunity to constantly expand your skill set by delving into cutting-edge technologies, fostering continuous professional growth. This unique combination of flexibility and a commitment to learning makes it an ideal environment for those seeking a dynamic and enriching career in network engineering.","While the remote flexibility is a perk, it can sometimes challenge team collaboration. The absence of in-person interactions may affect camaraderie. The self-driven schedule requires high discipline, and the lack of immediate access to colleagues can result in delayed responses. Despite these, the overall positives make it a compelling opportunity for those thriving in a remote work setting."
NTT DATA,2,6-Dec-23,No opportunity to gain experience. Leadership out of touch with employees.,Digital Technology Analyst,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"Opportunity for entry level developers to get a position. Interview process was relatively easy - preliminary phone call with recruiter, technical phone call with client, technical video call with client.

Generally good work/life balance. Some clients expect long/unusual hours (e.g., west coast hours for an east coast developer), but on most projects, there is freedom in your schedule.

Direct managers can be good, depending on who you are under.","Lacking actual opportunity to gain experience at the entry level. Many clients want 8 years+ of experience, so many entry level developers are not able to be placed on projects. This results in a lot of bench time or time on projects in non-development roles. 

Work is mundane. Lots of meetings.

Lots of bureaucracy typical of a large company. Employees are restricted from downloading any software, even that which is necessary for development.

New bench policy is 6 weeks of paid bench, then 4 weeks unpaid, after which the individual is let go. Number of bench weeks available resets after 6 uninterrupted months on a client project. While on bench, resources are expected to apply internally for positions on client projects. Previous policy was unlimited bench, and the change was the result of an acquisition.

Poor benefits
 - 2 weeks of PTO that moved up to 3 weeks after company acknowledged that their benefits are poor compared to other companies. No other benefits changes.
 - ""Reimbursement for training"" as a benefit is misleading. Company will not pay unless it is determined there is a business need (i.e., a requirement by the client).

Raises and bonuses are minimal and do not reflect performance whatsoever."
NTT DATA,3,7-Feb-24,Good for Beginners & Resume Boosting,Field Service Technician,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","New York, NY","The experience can be a big boost to your resume & give you a taste for the highs & lows of Tech work. Some colleagues can provide really good support & insight for navigation with clients, projects & problems.",Upper management as a whole. They try to cut hours & pay as little as much as humanly possible. Staff get calls from management if the deliveries & recoveries run long. Staff do not need to be working slowly for this to happen because if it goes past 1 PM they will call wondering why the staff is not done yet. Some staff can fail the background check & cannot set foot in several sites (such as schools) so they will be almost unable to help.
NTT DATA,5,7-Feb-24,Great company to work for,Facilities Director,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Denver, CO","The company, at least in my org, does care about the employees.

NTT DATA,2,12-Dec-23,Internal development has no support,Mid Level Engineering Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Salt Lake City, UT","Remote work is the standard, pay is OK","There are no internal resources for code development of demos for prospective clients. No version control or code repositories, no compute resources, extensively blocked web domains for accessing common public development resources and files such as hugging face, drop box, etc. We've been asked to develop and host demo code for prospective clients on our personal machines and github accounts. It's a farce.

Communication with management is tense and generally unproductive, even just in getting clarification on project goals and assignments. Very low-trust culture. Highly disorganized. Roles and responsibilities are consistently unclear. 

No credible possibility of upward mobility. Recent changes to the bench policy push people out of the company if they don't have billable work for a month, but ICs and low-to-mid-level management employees are not empowered to get clients. It's just a form of layoff.

Good engineers. Bad management."

They constantly gloat about how much money they make, but it seems to be largely at the expense of their employees. 

I quit months and months ago and am still dealing with them. They “overpaid” me multiple times after I quit and 6 months later want their money back. After I agree to setup a payment plan to reimburse their mistakes, they continue to lose the checks I’ve been sending them. Then pushing their business burden off on me, requiring I continue to track down checks that they keep losing.

I love the management philosophy of Leadership, Leverage, Results. Early on in every position, the employee is asked ""what is your next play."" The company is always looking to determine your next role and opportunity.","LinkedIn hires on pedigree and age. Most managers are under 30, directors are under 40, and anyone over 40 is a rarity. Important positions will be staffed based on the university the employee graduated from, rather than work experience. Sales process is being created by recent Ivy League grads who have never sold. Some sales and service director positions have been filled with individuals who are extremely smart but have limited to no experience selling and retaining. The attitude is if you are smart, you can lead any team no matter if you have zero experience doing your staff's actual trade. 

The millennial focus is highlighted in many aspects of the culture. At the 2016 global sales organization meeting, messaging was all about ""you are the best-of-the-best"" and that LinkedIn would not be successful without the individual job you do. Top performers were highlighted in front of thousands of employees. As the employee came to the stage to receive their well deserved award, videos of colleagues commending them were shown. Interspersed among work-centric kudos, the awardee's parents were shown in the videos congratulating their child and stating how proud they were of them. For a non-millennial, it was weird to see their parents congratulating their kid in a work setting. But this is also a company who holds Bring Your Parents to Work Day."

LinkedIn,3,8-Nov-23,Poor Place to Work,Sr. Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Chicago, IL","I recently concluded my tenure at LinkedIn, and while the platform's mission is one I deeply resonate with, my experience differed from what I had anticipated. I encountered challenges with the company culture that did not align with my personal and professional values. There were instances where the work environment felt less inclusive and supportive than I had hoped for, which impacted my experience negatively. Despite these challenges, I also want to acknowledge the opportunities for learning and growth provided by the company. The ability to connect with a vast network of professionals and access to a variety of resources were definite highlights. For prospective employees, I recommend a thorough consideration of the company culture and values to ensure they align with your expectations. It's essential to find a workplace where you can thrive and feel valued.","While working at LinkedIn, I faced several challenges that shaped my perspective on the company. The team dynamics and company culture did not foster the inclusive and supportive environment that I value in a workplace. Opportunities for advancement seemed limited and were not transparently managed, which often left me and some of my colleagues feeling overlooked and undervalued. Additionally, the feedback mechanisms in place did not always feel effective, with concerns not adequately addressed or acted upon by management. The work-life balance was also a concern, with expectations sometimes extending beyond reasonable working hours without clear compensation or acknowledgment. It's important for potential employees to be aware that while LinkedIn offers a platform with great potential, the internal work environment may not meet everyone's expectations for a positive and progressive workplace."

No raise last year, many more people being placed on PIP than ever. Teams are struggling to keep the lights on.

Consider retention bonuses or other means to keep talent. The frustration is palpable.

The company pushes DEI but everyone in sales ops leadership positions has top tier mba and nearly identical resumes. The company seems to understand that exclusively hiring a particular ethnicity or gender would limit perspectives and growth (and is just wrong), but that same thinking doesn’t apply to education and professional experience within sales ops. Our CEO didn’t complete college but there’s a false ivory tower in sales ops for mbas created by mbas.

You get to wait for last minute decisions and opaque messaging from leadership together. They spew things about growth and learning but could care less just focus on your cpps and reviews ignore anything that does not support that. Double speak is like air or water at LinkedIn especially from the CEO and C-Suite WLB went down the drain I went from working like 40+ hours a week I'd do some overtime occassionally before ramps and for oncalls at times but it was decent. Near the end it was not uncommon for me to wake up logon remotely as soon as I woke up until like 9 or 10 and night rinse and repeat. They will announce initiatives for new tech and the like every blue moon but very rarely allocate time for teams to execute any of it. Do not be suprised if a project you are working on is cancelled and reorged.
LinkedIn,5,20-Jul-23,Pinch me because I must be dreaming,Program Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","San Francisco, CA","Going from consulting to LinkedIn was a welcome shock to the system. Overwhelmingly positive vibes from all my team members and everybody I've had the pleasure of working with. Very collaborative environment and plenty of resources for those times you get stuck on something. I've learned as much in 1 year as I did in say 5+ years in my last job. Really can't say enough good things about the environment here. Maybe some would ""toxic positivity"" but it still seems genuine to me. Benefits are pretty standard when compared to other big tech companies. That said, they're outstanding compared to anything else. It's really hard to beat 50% 401k matching up to fed max and almost free, quality health care. I wish I had this kind of maternity/paternity leave earlier in my career. I think it's upwards of 6 months, paid. Random perks like free gym membership, swag, etc. are all great too. Pay and stock options were plenty competitive in my case, although I have heard some say that it's a little average or below compared to Google...but like c'mon that's like saying I won't take a Ferrari because it's not a McLaren. It's still a freaking Ferarri.","Ummm...if you're only after $$$ then you might do better somewhere else, but the compensation is competitive and if you've never worked in big tech it's quite good. Given the current ""macro economic"" cycle there's been some push to ""do more with less"" and some stress about layoffs (LI did a few rounds earlier this year). That said, 5% is a far cry from the upwards of 30% that I've dealt with in the past so YMMV."

Also, pains of a big company, a lot of bureaucracy, requests take a long time; often reps suffer the unfair consequences of a convoluted system. Getting resources and information is very complicated, and frequently no one knows who to ask for X. Internal mobility is not clear; they ""encourage"" us, but it's just as difficult to figure out and hard to get clarity on who to speak or what steps to take. Promotions are bleak, especially now. Many colleagues who are deserving of a promotion are stuck in their current roles becase there simply isn't enough room for everyone to grow. It's a hard problem to solve!

There is a bizarre lack of basic skills in sells. This extends into sells management in sales. Executive staff seems to be well aware of this and are trying to implement a change management process, but these are being derailed by the recent Google arrivals who’ve made alliance with the old stagnated LinkedIn guard. The results is accelerating revenue DEGROWTH. This is also the worst possible time because of the scrutiny social media companies are facing after Elon outed many of them for having fake engagement. Customers are losing faith in the product and it shows. There also appears to be the remnants of a culture war present. All in all I would definitely avoid this place unless you are in desperate need of a job.

1. They do not promote from within, so your Regional Sales Manager will know less than you do about digital marketing, Salesforce, internal contracts & anything relating to internal procedure red tape.
2. This is a cold calling job- period.
3. You will spin your wheels on “renewals” as client cancelations & complaints are the norm. 
4. You will be held to elevated quotas with no explanation or reasonable analytics. 
5. Regardless of tenure & success, you will be fired after 3 months.
6. They claim to be “Client Forward”, however there is no help, concern or actionable procedures for disgruntled clients.
7. It’s a churn & burn environment - for both clients (just cancel them & sell new), or employees (hit the number or we replace you). 
8. Lastly, FindLaw was a great place to work years ago, however with the tiny salaries, huge quotas & no pension or job stability - it has become an entry level playground for the misinformed. You are just a number. The few people making money here are in the top territories. They make money but hate their jobs. Run. Run like the wind."

•	Career opportunities: The size and scope of the firm provide room to move into other business functions
•	Decent social life at Reuters Events for junior and middle management

If it's your first job, join TR and stay for a year for the brand then swiftly move into into something else.","•	Strategic Oversight Issues: lack of strategic awareness among senior and middle managers, resulting in instances of over-promising and under-delivering eventually most of the team (apart from middle and senior managers) was made redundant. 
•	Favouritism and Potential Retaliation: The existence of managerial favoritism, coupled with a perception that dissenting voices are not welcomed, was concerning. Instances where going against management resulted in active pushback and attempts to sideline an overachieving colleague are particularly troubling.
•	Questionable Handling of Disagreements: A colleague was targeted by middle and senior management for expressing dissent when offering constructive criticism and presenting differing viewpoints. Managers tried to push colleagues out of the firm despite the team being made redundant (Real crappy environment to work in)
•	Professional Development: No professional development opportunities beyond what is needed for the product. 
•	Poor Compensation: Below-inflation increases in salaries which impacted overall job satisfaction and motivation."

•	Brand is useful for securing better positions elsewhere","•	Seriously, management has no clue where they're going – their strategy changes faster than the wind (without consulting team), and we're stuck picking up the mess 
•	Senior Management? More like a bunch of incompetent mates who stumbled in straight from a polytechnic without a hint of real management training or basic communication skills
•	Professionalism took a permanent vacation 
•	Most events are compensated through commission. And guess what? The events are dished out based on who's the teacher's pet or the office heartthrob. This means a handful of people that are in the right sectors and events within that sector get big payouts whilst the rest are left to ask parents/mates for financial support 
•	Very high turnover of good-quality ethnic minorities 
•	The culture at Reuters Events is toxic and full of bullies who push you to go ABOVE AND BEYOND a lousy 25k salary in this economic climate
•	Many committees for Sustainability and DEI initiatives that talk a lot but do nothing 
•	Career progression? Good luck with that. You practically have to beg for a promotion, and when you finally get it (a few years later), they throw in a less than 5k"

- 1000SGD non cashable top up to reimburse gym, dental, insurance etc
- 2 days mental wellness day a year
- many days of annual leaves, more than market average. typically I can save 27-28 days per year
- sometimes sends ""goody bags"" to our address, like afternoon tea sets etc, depending on budget","- lack of headcount, a ton of work for way too little people
- pay feels stagnant, as with MNCs. No AWS, 5% ish ""bonus"", depending on KPI. 
- rigid internal processes
- trying to save cost by hiring from india/ philippines/ etc. While these people are talented, sometimes it is hard to coordinate since our key markets are in Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, and more
- always pushing for KPI. We can beat revenue YoY, but salary wise it feels very underwhelming and lackluster. Where is the money going?
- do not reflect well on the company when senior management is leaving one after another in such a short span of time. Even the SG HR left, so now we are under HK HR. The site head for Singapore also left, leaving many vacuums."

Parking lot is well-lit.
Building has an interesting shape.
There is a Caribou Coffee on site.","It's hard to put into words what an awful company this has become ever since the Thomson family purchased it an the family patriarch died. The only thing that the Thomson children want is to maximize how much money they can squeeze from every resource and human being regardless of how callous and mean-spirited. 

For example, every single year, they have been cutting staff and making the remaining people do more to make up for the employee shortage. For jobs that are critical, they have been offshoring them to India and making the current staff in Eagan train their Indian replacements. I have seen so many co-workers sitting and crying at their desks while the company brings in outside consultants to help boost morale with condescending cheerleaders to make you feel guilty for your own unhappiness. 
""Where is YOUR 'mood elevator' today?""
A decade ago, we had nice cubicles where we had room to work. Over time, individual workspaces were reduced, and reduced, and reduced, to a point now where you are not even allowed to have a picture of your kids at your desk. And for what??? All that space that once allowed people to have a comfortable work area now just sits empty. Literally empty. Where the workstations used to reside have been turned into nothing but empty carpeted areas.
It is clear that this historic company is just being carved up at sold at auction so the Thomson kids can live extravagant lifestyles—completely numb to the suffering they cause their employees. 
STAY AWAY!!!"

- leadership changes and shifting priorities as a result can feel like a hamster wheel at times, though this is hard to avoid in media in general
- company gradually getting cheaper with what they will invest into the employee experience yet they expect more out of us. For example, the NYC office recently switched from permanent desks to hot desking and there are rarely enough desks for everyone who comes in yet we are all expected to come into the office more?

Although, I'm not sure how long TR can live off their past grandeur.","Management have no direction, it changed quicker than the wind and we were always left to pick up the pieces. Senior Management is essentially a bunch of cowboys, who started working for the company when it was still FCBI straight out of uni, and have had no real management or business training. The lack of professionalism is unimaginable for anyone who has worked elsewhere. All company risk is put on the employer, as the vast majority of our pay was based on event commission. The events you were given were strongly based on favouritism, and often sexism, whereby some people continuously were receiving huge commissions (the main reason why they have stayed!) and others get nothing. The culture is toxic and full of bullies. You are expected to work well beyond contract hours, as it is the only way to attempt to make any commission. Next to no progression, people had to almost beg for any sort of promotion, and when they finally got the role, they were only offered £2-5K more despite a doubling in responsibility. The last 2 pay rises their initial offer was a 2% increase which was around £800 a year (given the low salaries to begin with)."

Working here allows me to be part of a prestigious organization with a strong reputation. One of the biggest pros of working at Thomson Reuters is the emphasis on continuous learning and professional growth. The company offers a wide range of training and development programs. TR promotes diversity and inclusion, creating a workplace where individuals from diverse backgrounds are valued and respected. This fosters a culture of creativity and collaboration. TR values work-life balance and offers flexible work arrangements. This helps employees maintain a healthy balance between their professional and personal lives. I really appreciate the idea of providing work from anywhere opportunity where you can travel to any location to spend time with your family without affecting your work. TR values internal talent and provides opportunities for career advancement. Employees can grow within the organization. Overall I am happy to be a part of Thomson Reuters.","Competition among employees for promotions or recognition can be intense, leading to a potentially stressful work environment. While TR invests in technology, some employees may face challenges in adapting to new tools and platforms. With a global workforce, communication across different time zones and languages can sometimes be a barrier to effective collaboration. At times, while working in sales I have faced a lot of pressure when I was actually looking for some support. The fast-paced nature of the financial and legal industries that Thomson Reuters serves can sometimes create a high-pressure work environment, which may not be suitable for everyone."

They equip you with the tools and resources you need to do your job productively. Generally speaking most people TR are friendly, easy to work with, and hard working but not INTENSE (all caps). Lots of opportunity for creativity or ingenuity within your role and leadership generally welcomes ideas and creative suggestions (at least in my org).","Their current push via the CEO Steve Hasker for hybrid work is hypocritical while we also have programs and groups designed to encourage their overall ""work to live not live to work"" philosophy and their more progressive policies for working parents, neurodiverse folks, work from anywhere, etc. It also severely limits employees from growing their career with TR because hybrid roles require physical proximity to only a few places in the U.S. They also are a print company that became a technology company, but so much of their infrastructure is organized horizontally instead of vertically, and the product and tech teams aren't aligned with their front of house coworkers. Working on one part of one product creates a lot of unnecessary silos. They have an annual end of year ""culling"" of employees to hit shareholder expectations but justify it as being ""nimble"" or ""responsive"" - November is a rough month at TR."

As a Director, I am able to still easily draw a line in the sand on family time vs. work. Pay is competitive - it didn't use to be that way but TR has focused on market adjustments, including bonuses, etc. There are a broad array of benefits from 10 days of family caregiver time, separate sick time, and unlimited vacation. Additionally TR recently launched a sabbatical program (non-paid) up to 6 months every 5 years. While other companies offer paid sabbaticals, I consider it progress. For those expecting a child, TR has one of the best parental leave (birth or adoption) policies out there - globally a minimum of 16 weeks paid leave regardless of gender. For those in the US, that is in addition to FMLA, etc.","Most are pretty meh about the return to office for those that are hybrid. While there is value coming in at opportune times, it seems as though some of the most senior leaders are a bit out of touch for org wide to try to hit certain attendance numbers each week. I mean, it could be worse, but while folks have worked remotely (mostly) during the pandemic and after we also saw record profits.

As they've built out the various teams, often no one is located in the same area, so collaboration becomes difficult. I guess that's just a fact of life through COVID-19 and now as we seem to be transitioning away from that era, but I'm not sure they've thought much about the toll it takes on the collaborative process.

Honeywell,4,45317,Good Company - Just be ready for change,Offering Management,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","Atlanta, GA","Fortunate to have had some terrific managers over the years who have been and still are on my personal board of directors. 

Our current Exec Leadership is evolving, however, while very focused on growth, they are listening and engaging.

Our benefits packages are better than most. While we are middle of the pack in some areas, we do lead in several.

Our Employee Resource Groups create a space for everyone to feel like they belong. They offer ways for community engagement and personal betterment.

Very innovative company, almost too a fault. We are highly invested in R&D which can mean you sometimes forget about all the great NPI we have made.

Amazing team of employees and friends.","All depends on if you are in it for only you or looking at a larger picture. There are many, in every company, who have negative statements about their workplaces. If you know that you are going to work for a large global company and think it will be like working at a small family business, wake up.
Honeywell is there to make money for their shareholders and that can create a fast paced, hard core, very direct environment that not everyone can live/ work in.
Be honest with yourself and know what you are getting into, no matter where you decide to work. After all, it is your decision to accept any/ all job offers and the associated pay/ benefits.

Would say that over the past 5-10 years HR has put us in a very ""woke"" system that is broken. This is one piece that does need attention or you will run the folks with the IP away."
Honeywell,1,45337,Watch out for the Anthem Program,Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Phoenix, AZ","This is specific to Anthem- you might also see ""Next Gen avionics"" in the job description.
You'll be working in a modern environment. No 30-year old cubicles, you're not using obscure tooling like PVCS that you'd be ashamed to put on your resume.
Anthem is a huge priority for Honeywell and gets a lot of attention.","The amount of turnover should speak for itself. Most teams have lost half their members in the last two or three years. One reason for that is that if you work here you will have to compete with up to 20-25 other direct reports for your boss's help.

Don't believe the terms in your offer letter- those 13 days of company holidays? Last year managers told us ""don't plan for December vacations"" despite above-average Q4 performance. Salary might seem ok but raises never track inflation. Work life balance is notoriously bad- a whiteboard here has the quote ""death is not a reason not to close your story"", and after my spouse had a panic attack my leader said ""well we all have work-life issues like that we have to deal with"".

There's a reason Anthem is hiring a lot right now. Customer schedules are at risk and leadership would rather throw more water in the bucket than plug the holes in it. If Anthem were a great team more Honeywell employees would want to switch teams."
Honeywell,4,45341,Professional & personal growth platform,ASM (Area Sales Manager),"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Pune,"Well onboarding process. personal & professional development platform available & company also looking into employee personal development in terms of family relationship, health issue & also this platform available for employee family too.",Nothing so far.

Honeywell,3,45272,Decent opportunity but negligent management,Systems Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"- None of my bosses have micromanaged details like hours worked or emails responses
- Good opportunities for lateral movement, so many people stay at Honeywell for years
- Some of the Phoenix area sites have made significant improvements in the last five years with ping pong tables, employee events with food provided, and many newer employee clubs
- Most engineers are friendly and I've rarely met toxic or egotistical lower-level employees.","- Honeywell says Innovation is a top priority but somewhere the message gets lost in middle management, and therefore many new products still use code written in the 90s and archaic software tools
- Export control processes have gotten Draconian and un-collaborative. Hope you enjoy typing a business justification for virtually every external email. Many teams have to been told to stop using Excel's real time co-authoring for anything.
- Managers care more about analyzing KPI's and CDR's than understanding the work of entry-level employees that make those KPI's and CDR's happen.
- Program budgets on civil aviation can be disorganized and chaotic. You may work mandatory overtime and then be told to stop working on all customer projects in the same quarter.
- Work-life balance depends heavily on the teams. Sometimes managers barely know what each employee is working on each week, but I've also seen teams where weekend meetings were normal
- Direct managers may be remote, and can sometimes be too hands-off. Good luck getting your manager to appropriately address a dysfunctional team when you've never physically met them and only talk once a month."

Honeywell is a very strong, reputable, and competent organization. The people are very helpful and positive. The pay is fair. Work / life balance is adequate thus far.",It is a LARGE company so things seem to move slow. The ramp up is long so it is important to maintain expectations. As a sales person you typically want to get out there and start making things happen. There is a long ramp up that includes a ton of administrative items and mandatory training so customer facing activities are several weeks out from initial start date.

Popular brand that looks good on a resume 
Great partner network that help to promote your products","Work life balance, you’re expected to be available to work through holidays, weekends, and after hours. There is a strong always on call culture.

Systems, everything from quoting to following up on repairs, to SFDC is a mess. There’s no help coming.

Management’s expectations. Your KPIs and goals are insane. Being on 15 customer calls and 8 onsite each week while also putting in 20+ hours of admin work is impossible (the account set is 30 accounts). You’re stuck between getting onsite and selling or getting your reporting in on time, whichever you pick will be wrong.

Quotas, you don’t see any commission below 60% attainment. If you get close you’ll get accounts added and the number will move."

If you are an experienced professional being approached by a Honeywell recruiter, please be aware that you may get the job and make more money here but you will be treated like trash. So unless you lose your job and need to earn income, please stay away from this company. You may be better off in your current job even if it pays less. The HR is mostly non existent in this company and HR policies are silly. They recently fired the President and CEO of one of their businesses as he was a terrible guy and he has been sitting in the office and lashing out at his staff. In the org structure, all the staff still reports to him, even after he was fired. The HR in this company is sleeping at their desk. In other companies, a fired executive would have been sent out of the door on the day of firing and not allowed to harass his former staff, but the Executive Leadership does not care, for them employees at any level are replaceable."

-I had another manager who got promoted as a project manager for Aero. This is an individual who made anti-semitic remarks at a happy hour and still got PROMOTED..shows you the type of people Honeywell promotes.

It's one of the most negative work environments I've been a part of and I've seen multiple good workers driven to leave due to a strain on their mental health caused by the culture."

This individual operates under the belief that they are always correct, offers no support to subordinates, and is treated like a master-slave behavior.

Yes, the conditions and benefits are not the worst, but there is a real workload... The work has piled up because if you can't reply to emails in time new ones appear asking you to reply to old ones.
So because of that, all the time there are admissions - some people leave and new people come in and so on. I have been transferred to a new department and when I asked for training, I was told: You already know everything! You've got a fail-safe there,

I am the only member of my team that is required to have my code reviewed, for example - Similarly, if you don't speak and read Chinese you need to use autotranslate for nearly everything, including tons of important documentation that doesn't really translate well from such disparate languages. Most meetings will also be held in Chinese, meaning you will rely on both voice recognition and autotranslate for hour+ long meetings that are mandatory. - About 1/3 of the 'total compensation' for the position is in bonus and stock.

I really liked it but,"I got fired because I work for an app I clock in and out of the app. I clocked in with the app. So I clock out with the app. Service for our phones didn't work. I didn't get the password for the Internet like the others did. I was actually focused on the job. But, I asked her if I could stay for the rest of the shift which was like 10 /15 left. She said no but I was schedule to 4:30 But it was a whatever situation. Again no service. I wrote the time that I actually clocked out on the paper that provided us. But I still also clocked out of the app that I clock in and out to and assuming they will change it because they had the time. They fired me instead. And if not because of that it's because I am pregnant and they knew that. So, for my advice.... I feel like Instead assuming the worse in people thinking that they were trying to get over or something maybe you should ask or understand why I clocked out on the app. It has a location where it shows where I am. Again there is no service in the building at all!!!! I never got the Wi-Fi password. Other than everyone else I was actually focus on the job and not on my phone. And if that wasn't the cause just because someone is pregnant doesn't mean they can't do the job. I am only 9 weeks But I feel that wasn't the case. I really liked the job and felt like I was mistreated by being fired. We have to clock in and out of the app and I let them know and I also ask them if I will be able to get paid for the last 10/15ims of the shift that they said I would be working. Which I am not wrong for asking questions. I feel completely insulted and disrespect my this company."

ByteDance,2,45035,Not a good mix with US Tech Culture,Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"Good compensation. I hear that this has been toned down recently, but it was definitely good when I was hired. Good buildings. The offices in the Bay Area are of high quality. Wide desks. Privacy separators between desks. There are walkways around desk blocks. Good lighting. Great view of the hills/mountains from the San Jose and Mountain View offices. Decent benefits for a T1 tech company. Not as good as Google, but competitive all the same. Large numbers of highly technically proficient people. They know their stuff and you can really tell early on that you're working with people who have heads on their shoulders.","Incompetent management. This is partly due to how the company is structed in a flat manner, but they also put accomplished ICs into low-level management positions where they start out managing several dozen (30+) people which is about 3x too many. The next level of manager commonly has 100+ direct reports. It's way too much work to place on far too few managers, so management tends to be incompetent. Because of this, ""managing up"" is required for a successful career simply because you have to manage yourself and then let your manager present that to his own manager. Incompatible tech cultures. Bytedance is a Chinese company and it really shows in how they do work in China vs. the US. There is a heavy emphasis on unity/harmony in the workplace which manifests as doing what you are told by the higher ups. You do not dissent, you do not disagree, you do not discuss. Doing so can cause visible signs of discomfort and it's common for them to feign agreement in order to end whatever discussion is going on. Incredible focus on short-term, measurable gains. It's led to a hodge-podge of outdated tech stacks mixed with highly customized forked open-source tools with no long-term plans for upstream merges or actual maintenance. Code is frequently copy-pasted, code reviews are practically nonexistent, docs are written almost purely for performance review and so read more like advertisements than technical documents. Very political. Working cross-team can be very difficult. People jealously guard their work and seem to be constantly in fear of any project that could lower the impact of their own work. Bad projects are kept alive and used far longer than is reasonably justifiable due to politics. Good projects cannot get off of the ground because some higher up somewhere doesn't think it's a good idea. There are committees and bureaucracy everywhere for all sorts of things and approval is commonly multi-stage."

Amazon Web Services,4,45306,Amazon SWE Experience,Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Seattle, WA","Scale and Impact: Amazon operates at an enormous scale, allowing SWEs to work on projects with significant impact and visibility.

Learning Opportunities: Amazon is known for its fast-paced and challenging work environment, providing engineers with ample opportunities to learn and grow in their careers.

Innovation: The company encourages innovation, and engineers often have the chance to work on cutting-edge technologies and contribute to projects that can shape the industry.

Compensation and Benefits: Amazon typically offers competitive salaries and a comprehensive benefits package, including stock options, health insurance, and other perks.

Networking: Working at Amazon provides the opportunity to collaborate with smart and driven professionals, facilitating valuable networking and skill-building.","Work-Life Balance: Amazon is notorious for its demanding work culture, and some employees report challenges in maintaining a healthy work-life balance due to long working hours and high expectations.

Pressure and Stress: The fast-paced nature of Amazon's business can lead to high levels of stress and pressure, particularly during peak periods or when tight deadlines need to be met.

Hierarchy and Bureaucracy: Some employees feel that the company's organizational structure can be bureaucratic, making it challenging to implement changes quickly.

Limited Ownership: In a large organization like Amazon, some engineers may feel that they have limited ownership over their projects or that decision-making is concentrated at higher levels.

High Turnover: The competitive nature of the tech industry can lead to high turnover, with some engineers leaving for other opportunities after a relatively short tenure."

Great internal tooling and services. Its very simple to build something new and focus on the parts you care about, rather all of the boilerplate stuff. There is a bit of tedium here and there, but generally the documentation is great.

Many teams are highly distributed. Nearly everything that you do in those teams has massive customer impact and hence visibility. It feels rewarding seeing your work pay off immediately in metrics/customer experience. This also opens up many doors for promotions.

Extremely talented and smart people work here. You'll learn a lot from them and they'll help advance your career.","The s-team is completely out of touch. They make short sighted decisions for temporary gain. People are frustrated with them, and their lack of transparency, sympathy, and communication. Managers are unable to do anything, all decisions made by the s-team are final. Its difficult to stay motivated in such an environment. The talent is already bleeding, and it will only get worse.

WLB is highly dependent on your team. That being said, oncall tends to be awful and drives down WLB."

It's super hard and won't be directly used with your work. There are no clear guidelines about workflow or targets, as AWS is like a utility service with no direct mentorship.

Amazon Web Services,5,45317,You will certainly land on your feet,Security and Compliance Specialist,Current Employee,,"Compared to most corporates I have worked for, AWS have ripped up the rule book for roles.

The role often demands long hours and intense workloads, especially during project peaks, impacting work-life balance at times. Keeping pace with rapidly evolving technologies requires a continuous commitment to learning and staying updated, which can be demanding.

Amazon Web Services,2,45321,Stressful and Unnecessary,Account Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Washington, DC",Product can sell itself and the growth during the pandemic was probably the last of their boom times. Can make a good living. Best part of working at AWS is that you can leave for anywhere you want and it will likely be a cake walk in comparison of workload.,"Never been so exploited in my life. After two straight years of overachieving quota I was told they were “thinking” of putting me on a plan, which was an axe over my head. Manager literally told me my success was like a tree falling in the woods (you know the rest), even though I was on a team with over 30 people on it which made it impossible to get noticed because my manager played favorites with certain demographics who did much less work. I was also told because I wasn’t apart of any DEI groups I had a target on my back. Had a new team member get promoted to Team Lead within 4 months of being on the team and our 1:1s turned into me coaching them. Management also has to select people to put on plan every year regardless of performance, which explains why they couldn’t give me a solid explanation of why they wanted to get rid of me. 

I was told to do work that had nothing to do with my job which gave me an avg workday of about 10-12 hours at my desk. Your management will abuse you then ask you for ways to help them get promoted. Many of whom were cycled through new leadership roles within a year.

2 years after working there I still resent the time I wasted slaving away for them. Luckily this was during the pandemic so I didn’t have much else to do but it’s an extremely tolling culture. In any other sales org you are rewarded for hitting your number but here that was only one small piece of what it takes to get noticed. They will tell you everyone is an Army of One when you come on. Your experience at other companies will not matter and they will even put you down for it."

Marketing roles are actually more operations than anything else
Advice to job seekers: do not take a general marketing position, take a specialized position so that you can manage your own workload by telling people you can't get to things and are overloaded which just means the general marketing managers have to do it themselves along with their countless other weekly jobs. This is the only way to maintain an 8 hour workday. Discuss all the projects you can in meetings (even if they aren't your own) and do this confidently since many managers can't tell the difference between confidence and competence so you'll be looked upon favorably over those don't spend time to toot their own horn"

This restructuring resulted in a reduced team size, leaving those of us who remained to shoulder an overwhelming workload. The aftermath of the layoffs led to an atmosphere of stress, pushing us to our limits and unreasonably long working hours. It's disheartening to witness how the workforce reduction, instead of streamlining operations, has resulted in an excessive burden on the remaining employees. Adding to the turmoil is the noticeable presence of a clique-like culture, largely comprised of individuals who had migrated from Wells Fargo, the former workplace of our Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). A particularly vexing issue was the intricate process of getting things done. What should have been straightforward tasks often transformed into arduous journeys due to an overwhelming number of processes and procedures.

Middle management is reminiscent of employees from ""stereotypical"" DMV or Welfare/State run facilities, can be a biased work environment, where middle management has a lesser evolved recognition of self and picks favorites. So ability to earn money can be minimized by bias. Base salary is an unlivable wage in San Diego, unless you rent and have someone else contributing to daily living necessities.

Most of the time you drive for hours just to find out people are either not home or not interested in what you are selling. Even if we aren’t really selling anything. We are offering “free” money to just watch tv as they normally do, but because it cost nothing to participate most people think it’s a scam. The truth is there are a lot of restrictions to actually finding a compatible home willing to partake in a Nielsen ratings tv survey. Initial recruitment is too long of a process where you visit the same house over and over again. Most people could care less about a few hundred bucks over a 2 year period. Plus once they sign up the equipment needed to be installed is a hassle and you don’t get paid if field tech is unable to do the install. Pay is a joke for the time involved!"

Felt like I was hired to be laid off. Upper management I personally dealt with was very socially awkward and difficult to work with- this was not necessarily their fault but lack of emotional intelligence and basic sociability was rough to deal with in terms of communication.

It was really a joke and I am happy that I left that dysfunctional org. They don’t know how to set the sales targets and no brain to fix situation. They recently adopted sales force but because of inefficiency in leadership, they created excels and everyone was requested to keep them up-to-date …I hope someday they understand the proper use of salesforce. I found similar tendency among people worked only for Nielsen for long time. After the reorganization, those long term contributors(?) were given leadership(?) titles but they were not equipped with any skillset required for sales leaders. They happily put senior title roles and congratulate each other.. same type of people flock together and they are not first class. In my region, people say that a real brilliant people never consider to join this company and I understood it true. And it was a big mistake that I chose it. So my advice to job seekers is, better to avoid if you have anything else to do."

Unscrupulous Employee Acquisition Practices: Ethical concerns arise from the company's methods of acquiring and converting employees from other companies. 8. Negative Impact on Job Security: Conversion of permanent employees to contract workers (often after just one year of acquisition) minimizes job security and contributes to overall employment instability. 9. Contributing to Unemployment Crisis: Tech Mahindra's workforce practices may exacerbate the unemployment crisis by underpaying, mistreating, and offloading employees for cheaper labor with their practice of buying out all technical companies and services to build one giant (tech company), to gain greater control of the market & then consolidate employees within the organization. 10. Exploitative Wages: The company is notorious for underpaying professionals and specialists competitive, market - value rates, often taking advantage of newly acquired personnel during their short-notice transfers resulting from Tech Mahindra's acquisition of the employees' original employers, teams, depts, and roles, etc."

From day one, I was greeted with warmth and enthusiasm by my colleagues, creating a positive and inclusive work environment.

One of the most remarkable aspects of this company is its unwavering commitment to excellence. The management team consistently sets high standards and provides the necessary support and resources for employees to reach their full potential. The culture fosters collaboration, creativity, and innovation, encouraging everyone to contribute their unique talents.

Not only does the company prioritize professional growth, but it also places immense value on personal development. Through various training programs, workshops, and mentorship opportunities, I have been able to enhance my skills and broaden my knowledge base. This continuous investment in employee growth sets this company apart from the rest.

Another aspect that deserves praise is the company's dedication to work-life balance. They understand that a happy and well-rounded employee is a more productive one. With flexible work arrangements and supportive policies, the company creates an environment where individuals can thrive in their professional lives while also maintaining a healthy personal life.

Lastly, the company's core values are not just empty words on a wall; they are genuinely lived and upheld by everyone. The culture of respect, integrity, and inclusivity is palpable, making every individual feel valued and appreciated.

In conclusion, my journey with this exceptional company has been nothing short of amazing. From the supportive work environment to the emphasis on growth and work-life balance, it is evident that this company truly cares about its employees.

Following an abrupt shift to the night shift, promises of monetary benefits were made during a discussion with the manager.

The passage of time only deepened the sense of disillusionment, as employees grappled with the realization that the benefits pledged were nothing more than illusory commitments.
Team Resizing Decisions Influenced by Management:

The seemingly arbitrary decision to resize the team was purportedly influenced by client demands.
However, suspicions arose that the management played a pivotal role in shaping this decision, contributing to a sense of mistrust among employees.
In essence, the cons within this scenario are characterized by unfulfilled promises of night shift benefits and the subsequent disappointment stemming from false assurances.

It’s a large organisation that has a good reputation still in the industry.,"Specific to US healthcare consulting only - Extremely poor leadership, toxic culture,
not people centric at all, abject failure of leadership to invest in sales growth means every revenue generating employee also made responsible for additional sales - without any training or handholding. If they cannot sell, they better be prepared to ship out. People are managed based on perception rather than actual data and facts. The annual performance review is joke. They fired a lot of competent people in the last 3-4 years, especially those who helped build the consulting business and now the incompetent leadership just looks to pass the buck and look for excuses and scapegoats for their failures. Every 12-18 months, there is new leader who talks big, threatens with a big stick while quietly and constantly applying for opportunities elsewhere and leaving at the first available opportunity. Neither can they handle the pressure coming from the top nor do they have the skills required to achieve the growth targets. And thus, they put the pressure of growth on the mid-junior management to grow the business and make life miserable for them. Service delivery excellence, client satisfaction and being continuously billable is just “hygiene” for the leadership. And then the leader moves on to another organization, leaving the business poorer and in a worse condition than it was before they joined. The US Healthcare consulting business is little more than a meat shop and where people go to destroy their careers. Pressure on growing the business means mid level managers try to dupe gullible clients into over-staffing on projects for additional billing. They claim to be “partners” in growth for their clients but the fact is they always viewed as a mediocre, non-IT, staff augmentation company. 

At an overall organization level, the outgoing CEO (Tiger) was much more people centric and has shaped the organisation over the last 12 years but was shown the door earlier than planned. Now have a real hatchet man (internal company rumors) ready to take on the helm. The incumbent CEO’s very first town hall was not hopeful or motivating. It was depressing, dark and full of foreboding messages of ominous times for the employees who cannot sell."

No toxic employees or senior leadership. Senior Employees are very helpful towards freshers and new joiners.  No rejection on planned leaves. Ample of Parking Space for private vehicles.

Junior levels can actually have a good work life balance but as everywhere else, as you climb the ladder, the learning increases but that may happen at cost of family or personal time.","If the account your are part of is not setup correctly, then you will be juiced very well. In some scenarios, its an Operation driven decision making while HR is simply on loop, hence you may see people getting promoted without clearing minimum criteria industry-wise. Hence, internally, folks my be holding good designations but once they look out, they may get a reality shock. Also, being a captive, you are only good as the account you worked for. Genpact makes people do certain courses on their GENOME Learning platform, but they do not publish any certification for the completion of those courses to their employees, so many employees are trained on many tools and other domains but can't prove it anywhere due to lack of a certificate. There are other account level activities which certain employees take care of but can't showcase it anywhere regarding those experiences except talk about it. Folks get rewarded through cheers points for such adhoc efforts but again, there is no written recognition given to employees. Also, the 90 days notice period is indirectly an entrapment which forces many never to leave or take huge risk and resign with no offer in hand."

The technology is very interesting and engaging to work on. The scale and scope of the technology and manufacturing process is decidedly cool. The problems the company faces are measured in angstroms and dPPM, and it has the capability of measuring both extremely well. The work/life balance is a mixed experience. Overall the company is run by people who value working 60+ hours a week and being on call 24/7, but there's space for existing here at a more appropriate rate for your health and wellbeing. People generally understand that we all have family responsibilities, and that a healthy body is critical for a productive mind.","Executives are enforcing yes man tendencies, and getting routinely blindsided. The company broke export laws, and was fined 300M. The executives cut 300M in employee salary to cover the costs, which has netted a 30% employee reduction in the last 6 months. The company leadership isn't taking ownership of their responsibility for that decision. Employee wages are getting cut to fund stock dividend payments. The company budget for employee wages is now approximately 1/3rd the company budget for stock dividends. Promotions are drastically suppressed, and when they do happen are either made because the person in question is politically well established, or it's made out of desperation to retain employees. There is a chronic lack of vision about retaining and growing talent and leadership in an increasingly close to retirement age population. Critical departments are chronically understaffed, and when they do manage to pick up a competent or exceptional new hire, they quickly leave due to lack of career progression. Timelines for programs are so compressed that innovation is suppressed. Lack of personnel in critical departments is suppressing innovation. Lack of investment into innovation gets turned into poor management decisions when it comes time that we need massive changes. Risk tolerance is a bizarre mixture of extreme aversion to change, and totally impervious to potential downsides."

There are smaller companies that will pay almost double for the same position and rank. This shows not only financially, but also in the average level of talent of engineers. There are some great engineers at the company but the overall average skill level is pretty poor, putting a lot more pressure on the better engineers to perform past their limits to keep things moving.

There is also a very big value on company politics at the senior management levels. A lot of decisions are made to make the next guy up the latter happy rather than making the work of the engineers easier or more efficient."

Seagate Technology,2,45003,Good company with poor leadership,Engineer I,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Longmont, CO","-Your co-workers will likely be some of the kindest and most welcoming people you'll meet. 
-The culture is geared towards inclusion with Employee Resource Groups for the LGBT+ community, BIPOC communities, Neuro-divergent people, and others. 
-Generally laid back work culture as well. As long as you get your work done on time most people will leave you alone. 
-Benefits are good compared to other engineering companies.","-You will be paid less than your peers at other companies. If you ask for more management will give you lip-service about ""tight budgets"" and promotions are tied to time spent working at the company rather than the quality or the amount of work you are completing. 
-Be ready for lay-offs which will increase your workload and then a slow hiring process to get those people back once the company recovers. Co-workers will also be able to offer little support during these times as they will also be overloaded with work. 
-Most people in upper-level management roles will be out of touch and egotistical, do not depend on anyone but your manager to have your back. Be ready to keep your head down and say ""yes sir/ma'am"" when they ask something ridiculous of you as any criticism directed up the chain is unacceptable. -This is also true of any program leads. They will have a very ""holier than thou"" attitude especially if you need something from them. 
-The leadership is constantly makes decisions that make work harder than it needs to be. Recently these decisions have been mandating 40 hours of training without providing support for employees to find that training. Employees are expected to complete it on their own time. Additionally, the IT infrastructure is so restrictive that you often have to wait 2 days for them to do something on the back-end before you can even begin your work. 
-Very little vertical or horizontal mobility. Be prepared to work in your position for years without any changes other than to your workload. 
-The vast majority of the workforce is near retirement age and the company will do very little to retain new talent. Expect a very high turnover rate for younger workers at the company."

Fantastic office & benefits. Carefully built, welcoming culture of learning, experimentation, mentoring, and growth. I've never seen anything like this :) Interesting technical challenges given the high load: *to an extent*. Tech part is not the company's strong suite if you're comparing this to FAANG, but if you're in a team that doesn't actively maintain 20-years-old legacy, it's fine.","1. Not a tech company at its heart. A lot of things that in Google or Facebook or wherever would be done by dedicated DevOps or infrastructure team, are done by product devs with a bunch of bash scripts/cron jobs. This leads to some frustration and some wasted time. If you have ambitions of making a new programming language, developing the coolest in-house cloud in the world, or something equally risky and large-scale - Booking is probably not the right place. 2. Ancient tech stack that is literally older than me. This is improving, but not as fast as you would hope, partly because of p.1: people are focused on improving the product, and not necessarily streamlining development. I'm working with a relatively modern tech stack (recent Java), and I try to stay away from the legacy code. If you're interviewing for a job - be sure to ask about the tech stack of your specific team."

Incompetent person in leadership who is going to call you at 7pm for sprint planning. Also they won't have any idea what are you doing because .NET engineers are trivial here in their head, so if you ever have offer for this position just avoid unless you're desperate.

Most arrogant director who is absent at FY and proudly showing a massive slide of him traveling with big text saying thank you in Japanese written in alphabet.

 I have to wait the financial person to cut a cake to get a clarification about tax, in place!? awkward so say, so awkward I never worked in a company with HR as inhospitable as this. 

Truest definition of iceberg of ignorance, instead of involved in hiring process, they have to enforce 2 years contract to make the candidate not premature-quit.

(NATO, European Parliament, European Investment Bank);","Lack of flexibility:
- They sell you the company and organization as very flexible in terms of changing projects, responsibilities, remote working, but in practice it is not the case;
- You will be working 100% on-site even if they inform you that it is 3/2, hybrid, that's a lie;

Underpayment and Overwork:
- You will noticed rapidly that if you are directly contracted by NTT you are at a loss, contractors, freelancers and CDI through another companies that have contracts with NTT get paid 2 or even 3 times more than you;
- They will drop everything on you because you are 100% on-site, while the workload for contractors is minimal, direct employees have to deal with everything, from moving box to complex troubleshooting and designing.

Benefits:
- The so called allowances and benefits are subject to constant changes and voting by the ""board of directors"", one day they sell you the contract with an array of benefits, next week you have none, be careful;
- I was offered a relocation package of 2000€ for Luxembourg which can barely cover a single month of accommodation if you are moving with your family, if you chose to leave within less than 5 years, they will make you pay every single cent.

Payment, Over time, On Call:
- They make you report every single minute, it feels like you are working for a monitoring company;
- They do NOT correspond to the amount of reporting asked for, I went 2, 3 even 4 months with unpaid overtime, I'm talking working 2, 3 weekends straight with 10h+ per day, that combined with the fact that you receive 1/2 1/3 of what the contractors do.

Payroll and HR:
- There is a single person for each sector and they have little to no knowledge of how things work in Luxembourg, I received no instructions whatsoever, overpaid taxes for about 5 months because they messed up my tax card."

HubSpot,2,45328,Unmet Potential: HubSpot's Vision Falters in the Shadows of a Fractured Culture,Business Systems Analyst,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Cambridge, MA","HubSpot has a great overall compensation package, amenities, and resources for employees. The framework for greatness exists, and with the right leadership, I believe the envisioned excellence will be attained.","While HubSpot flaunts a truly impressive compensation package, top-notch amenities, and ample resources, there's an underlying sense that the organization is yet to realize its full potential. 

Regrettably, HubSpot appears to be a mere shell of the once-rumored #2 Best Place to Work. The initially touted culture serves as a tantalizing facade to lure in top talent, but as the veneer fades, a toxic underbelly of ""high-performance"" becomes increasingly apparent. What may seem like ones unbridled cynicism post-recruitment and during the theatrics of employee orientation soon reveals itself as a stark reality over time. In my brief two-year tenure, I witnessed an alarming level of turnover, layoffs, and burnout, surpassing the cumulative experiences of my multi-decade career. Remarkable individual contributors and stellar managers struggled against the tide, their efforts to foster an authentic company culture often thwarted. Exceptional leaders and contributors were, at times, driven away by the tenured and toxic gatekeepers, resulting in a very disheartening overall experience."
HubSpot,3,45264,AE's Be Advised - Terminated Before My 1yr,Account Executive,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",,"Hubspot is a worldclass leader in CRM/Marketing/Sales software, and has really created a phenomenal platform as well as marketing strategy for the platform. #1 platform in the industry, so you've got a great platform to sell. Overall, great company culture despite the way my journey ended.","I started in January, 2023 and was terminated the week after Thanksgiving, 2023. We all know tech sales have been a real challenge in 2023, but my experience at Hubspot may have prompted an exit from SaaS altogether. 

If we look at it from a numbers game, I was terminated at 86% attainment. I was struggling...had been for months. When I joined, I was told inbound should cover (approximately) 40-50% of quota, and the rest would be outbound. The reality? 10-20% each month. It was an uphill climb from day one. I know many reps who are also struggling and are looking for their next role elsewhere. I was anticipating starting PIP in December, I had joined a sales/tech coaching group, meeting w/ my manager 2x/week, meeting w/ high-performers and coming at it from every single angle I knew how all while it was taking an enormous toll on my mental health. 

Instead of PIP, HR joined my 1:1 with my manager and I was promptly let go. I admittedly wasn't super successful, but this was a really disappointing way to leave a company after I had invested so much time and energy and I never got a PIP to try to turn things around."
HubSpot,2,45309,Used to be a “best place to work”,Senior Account Executive,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,The product is best in class. The business outlook is fine as of now.,"Hubspot really was a best place to work at one time. Those of us who were there were lucky to have experienced that. 

I could write out a lot here, but it really boils down to: my experience is that hubspot cares about its employees and customers about as much as your average large corporation. 

It’s not the worst place to work, but it’s not an amazing place to work anymore. 

In my opinion, on average, employees seem a little unhappy and a bit disconnected from the mission. There are a lot of arbitrary KPIs to make up for lack of context/experience in some of leadership. Many who are coming from outside of hubspot and, in my experience, don’t necessarily understand what goes into the jobs of those around them. My experience is that you have to be ruthless or cut-throat to be successful. Cash compensation is on the lower end and there are many upcoming changes."
HubSpot,2,45315,It went downhill...FAST!,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,#NAME?,"I worked at HubSpot pre-Covid. The energy and support I felt from other HubSpotters way back when was amazing. It got the company through the hard early days of lockdown - then the surge in business that came right after. We supported each other through the good and the bad. HEART wasn't just a culture slogan but how most HubSpotters approached each other and their customers. 
But then something changed. ""High performance culture"" came in. Another way of saying we'll get rid of anyone for any reason we want. No more trying to lift up your fellow HubSpotter and supporting each other through challenges and tough times. Micromanagement took over and the vibe turned to Survivor. So many long time employees and leaders have left the company recently. It's become like any other big software company."
HubSpot,2,45339,High expectations,Finance,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Indianapolis, IN",The stock based compensation is a great benefit.,"Even though they are full remote and offer unlimited PTO, I am never able to take time off. I have even had my manager decline a vacation request during a non busy work time. I am unable to have appointments during the workday because my manager schedules meeting over them or constantly slacks me during the appointment. She also slacks me at all hours of the day. There is no work life balance. The expectation is you are on the clock 24/7 and must be available at all time. Another con is the promotion process is extremely slow. If you want to get promoted, even if your manager agrees, be prepared to have to prove it over three performance cycles and document extremely high performance."
HubSpot,1,45308,Overly focused on race and gender identity,Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Cambridge, MA",The pay was pretty good,"It's incredibly difficult to get promoted, unless you're a women or have a diverse gender identity, then its incredibly easy. Apparently, that's not problematic at all. They even brag about having over 50% women in leadership positions, that includes trans women, and that's how they do it. 

The CEO (also female) admits they're doing it on purpose, and even makes public company blog posts, and posts on women empowerment job sites about how they do it, completely oblivious to their bigotry and misandry. 

When the woman team lead, with only 4 years of junior level experience stepped down because it was too hard, they immediately promoted another woman with only 2 years of full experience who proceeded to ruin every project our team got due to lack of experience.

Even though I had 8 years of experience, I was never even asked or considered for a promotion in that area. I found another job pretty quickly, I'm currently at the team lead level in a Texas based company. One that is not overly woke."

Truly, I loved the culture and felt that they cared about their employees (very different from previous employers). There are plenty of one-off benefits that actually made me feel valued. When I exceeded quota, my manager sent me a nice bottle of champagne which really made me feel valued. Compensation is fair for the role and commission structure is very clear. No concerns about being cheated out of what you earned. Ramp is a full year, so it gives you time to learn the product and get comfortable with the role. Truthfully, it's an enjoyable and welcoming place to work. THe people are the best and I made real friends there despite the WFH environment.","A lottttt of meetings. I spent almost 2 hours a day in internal meetings. Truly a waste of time and annoying. Management also needs some work. The sales managers take way too much time off and don't really take the time to support their team. My manager, specifically, was out for a total of 3 months throughout the one year I was there. It was truly shocking. Unrealistic expectations. You'll be hired for an inbound sales role, then will never receive a single lead (FYI I'm fine selling OB, but to be hired for one role and receive a salary for that role then not receive the tools for it seems wild.)"

It felt like they didn't just ""talk the talk."" However, over the past few years, it feels like it has become the epitome of toxic positivity. They continue to use their Culture Code to explain things like consistent reductions, decrease in benefits, lowered performance reviews, etc. I haven't even been hugely impacted myself by these, but it's disappointing to see and it's made worse by leadership speaking as if we're watching a Ted Talk. 

In addition, there are some really shameful DI&B changes that have disappointed me hugely. For instance, on my team, every single person who has been let go has been a person of color. Speaking with management about disability accommodations during COVID spikes was a terrible experience. I know from fellow coworkers that there is truly disappointing treatment of parents on parental leave. My own personal experience as a marginalized employee has been so bad that if I had the resources and time, I would have moved forward with an employment discrimination lawyer, but at this point I'd rather just get out. 

The company feels like a sinking ship with constant scaling back of benefits, roles, compensation, equity, etc. There's no oversight of individual managers, and it feels like every time there's a company announcement, it doesn’t land with the broader company."

All of that has dropped away almost entirely and they only seem to be taking steps further to go towards the culture of any other large corp business out there.

To provide a more welcoming and constructive environment for all of its employees, politics should (and traditionally were) kept out of the office, but not so at HubSpot.

Regarding team dynamics, teams are set up to look good on paper, but managers are focused on completing rituals and voicing slogans while being indifferent to the progress and success of employees or else being too afraid of confrontation to actually make expectations clear. Supervisors have no interest in training new staff on company resources and company paradigms and merely wish to insert staff as cogs in the machine rather than preparing them for excellence and a greater contribution.

There also appear to be higher management schemes to fish for justification to push employees out of the company as a backdoor approach to layoffs, rather than being straightforward."

Lots of cons, but some of these are pervasive in tech and not unique to HS sadly.","- HubSpot is like a high school clique where those that are ""insiders"" are protected and promoted often at the expense of more skilled, smarter, mature, and more empathetic leaders. If you don't ""fit in"" to the HS way, you won't go anywhere and the ""HS way"", at least in product, often favors the men that have been here a long time and are now at the top. See the other brave reviewers here that have spoken out about how HS treats people with differing opinions, styles, etc. - We also vastly undervalue design and this seems to be getting worse by the day. We hire such talented designers and then don't give them the room or voice to lend their expertise. - Over the past year, the amount of autonomy of teams has dissipated. While this is to be expected as a company scales, some parts of this org now have highly paid, smart, and skilled IC's and middle managers who are basically just executing on the orders from people at the very top (again beware if you voice a different opinion)."

The next door is locked. They seldom promote from within the Support team, and when they do they parade it around like a youtuber giving $50 to a homeless man. They like to talk about appreciation, and mental health, and career growth, but make no effort to provide any opportunities for those things. They will strait up lie to you and then punish you for calling out the lie. Look at how many other people in the company say they would absolutely never do the job that support does, or allow themselves to be treated the way support does. Last year they laid off 500 people, 7% of the company, ""spread evenly across all departments"" but some how it was just under half of the support team, we spend the whole year struggling under heavy volume and all they did was demand more, then get upset when we took time off because it was getting to be too much.

I cannot stress enough, DO NOT apply to this job. There are plenty of similar roles with similar pay and benefits that wont leave you so stressed out that you need to see a therapist.

Good benefits
Fully remote","HEART is baloney. In the sales org there are extreme levels of micromanagement, from AE managers who don't know what they're doing. Many of HubSpot's sales managers were promoted internally because they performed well back when things were great and inbound leads alone would get you close to quota. Now that inbound leads have dried up and reps are struggling, the majority of managers have no idea what to do other than yell ""make more calls!"" or ""we need more pipeline!"" When you ask for advice, they'll offer no valuable insight, they'll just tell you to call your old leads you've already called 100 times. Or make you try to strong arm your prospects into signing on the spot (HubSpot sales managers love the used car salesman tactics). ""Coaching"" from your manager is often borderline bullying, offering no actionable advice and instead just picking you apart to make you feel worthless.

Your ability to succeed is extremely dependent on the manager you get and the install capacity you get assigned. If you don't luck out on both of these, long term success will be extremely difficult. Your next best bet will be to suck up to your manager and try to become one of their favorites, because management here will absolutely give you preferential treatment with passing you leads & opportunities if you're one of their favorites. 

My team is a team of 8 reps. In 2023, one by one, 4 of my teammates were put on PIPs and ultimately fired. A fifth teammate was put on a PIP but got off it. That's to say, in a single calendar year, our manager PIP'd 62.5% of the team and fired 50% of the team... in one year! It's sales so naturally there will always be some of this, but you gotta ask yourself - is it normal to PIP 62.5% of a team and fire 50% of that team in one year? Do you want to work at a place that does that? Most of those reps were hardworkers and had done well in the past, but were quickly PIP'd after a bad month or two.

Unless you're a star performer & management's darling rep, you'll work under constant stress & fear of being put on a PIP and fired. Most AEs here do, I know HubSpot has been a huge burden on my mental health compared to my previous sales jobs. The KPIs are unrealistic so if you want to succeed you'll be putting in plenty more than 40 hours/week."

They continue “benchmarking to the market” which basically means doing away with the benefits and culture that made HubSpot special and different from the typical corporation that treated you as just a number. Work-life balance was terrible to begin with and was made worse after the layoffs.

Additionally, the inclusion of unlimited paid time off was a notable perk.","In light of the shifting economic landscape, the organizational culture has undergone a notable transformation. What was once characterized by autonomy and trust has evolved into a situation marked by increased micromanagement and a prevailing sense of apprehension. The company's emphasis on cultivating a ""high-performance culture"" has resulted in a proliferation of performance improvement plans, terminations, and layoffs, despite prior assurances from executive leadership that every possible measure would be taken to prevent such outcomes. While some layoffs ostensibly were performance-based, others affected individuals who had never received unfavorable performance evaluations or been provided an opportunity to rectify any deficiencies. Following the layoffs, several of these individuals have been informed that they are ineligible for rehire, even as many of the previously eliminated positions have been reposted and new hires made. It is the perceived lack of transparency that proves most disconcerting—asserting that the layoffs were objective and driven by the fact that positions were no longer needed, only to promptly replace those who were let go. I'd have preferred to be told directly that it was based on performance. At least be transparent. Furthermore, amidst the escalating trend of micromanagement affecting lower-level employees, there seems to be a conspicuous dearth of oversight when it comes to the actions of top leaders. Ineffectual management goes unnoticed and unaddressed, and clear favoritism exists, granting a select few an audience even when their perspective may be misguided or based on inaccurate information."

HubSpot,2,45146,Mixed culture,Director,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,Customer focused company with interesting problems to solve,"The so called HEART is mosty talk. Not consistent. Humble and Empahty is only when you are in the circle of the leadership. Or, if you are within product org, you are treated well, if you are not part of product team and trying to collaborate with them, you are excluded. Also, there's no empowerment of decisions. Leadership review 100 pages of slides for each review meeting and tons of data and almost every business decisions need C level review and approval. There's no structure and process. Leaders talk about automation as priority but the problem starts with accountability and process. When those are not clear, every department is trying to fight their way to prove their value by stepping into other function or people's area. No work life balance. People at senior leadership level openly say there's only work life flexibility."
HubSpot,4,45154,"Great Company, Product Quite Complex",Senior Customer Success Manager,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",,"Pay, culture, benefits and time off (PTO, global week of rest), create your own schedule/ autonomy","Started out leading calls with VPs 6 weeks in while knowing next to nothing about the intricacies of the product (the training to this point was largely emotion based). The customers knowledge of the product ranges from next to nothing (if they weren't using it, big red flag, hah) to having a mastered it. The types of questions that consistently come up on calls and via email lead to me sifting through many, many Slack channels in desperate attempt for answers. I receive lots of support from my manager and peers, but often the questions are so complex that I'll receive 10 Wiki resources and/ or get on a call with a coworker that ends up being an hour long. Great company, but be prepared for this."
HubSpot,2,45187,Failure to Scale Effectively - Culture not what it was,Finance,Current Employee,,"Still a strong growth company; decent pay; internal mobility, remote work","HubSpot was once truly a great place to work, worthy of the prior accolades. Unfortunately, as the company has scaled, there have been a number of growing pains and it's now just slightly better than ""another company"". At least in the Finance department, working long hours is demanded in order to be successful, forcing trade offs in your personal life. A once strong team culture has been replaced with a toxic one, led by outside hires who have pushed out long tenured members of the team. Pressure to deliver against unrealistic expectations is at an all time high, and empathy is nowhere to be found."
HubSpot,1,45263,Buyer beware,Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Boston, MA",I do not have any.,"Feels like the company grew way too fast and everyone is scrambling to try and figure things out.

HubSpot,2,45154,Hire and Fire - Huge new rep turnover rate,Corporate Account Executive,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"World-class product - the product really is the best on the market. Flexibility in building custom packages for customers with products and pricing. Customers know and love the product and often bring it from company to company with them. In general, I have a ton of hope for HubSpot and there are some really amazing people there however there is a lot to improve on. I'm writing this review bc I wish I had seen one like it before I joined. If you are coming from a Salesforce, are super organized, and land on the right team with a good territory you will be great!!","You are very unlikely to make it out of your first year of Ramp Of my hiring class almost 50% were put on a pip and/or fired The managers have an actual incentive to continue to bring on new reps while pipping/firing under 1 year reps to keep their team number low, while they send good leads to tenured reps They provide very little training - managers do not have a ton of product knowledge and there is no formal training program Lots of noise and unfocused strategy - Strategy seems last minute and ad hoc. CRM DATA IS A MESS ---- This was a major shock for me because it adds an insane amount of admin work on your plate, think old contacts, duplicate records, and records that don't connect to our actual customer database. They ask you to hit prospecting metrics with extremely few tools and a messy crm which makes it super frustrating. Territories are unfair - Reps who have been there for 2+ years know every trick in the book and have bloated books of businesses by skirting around rules. Managers pass leads to tenured reps Leadership protects managers who churn through new reps, they say it's a mishirebut its really just bad or poorly trained managers Straddling the fence between a true enterprise org and a smb/mid-market org - they expect you to be running small transactional deals while executing complex deals with 10+ team member deal teams. This is nearly impossible with the amount of time in the day, messy crm data, metric expectations (ie calls, emails, activities and tasks), and internal meetings (there are a ton) VP of sales says we are on quarterly quota when you are actually on monthly quota. The sales cycle length is quarterly. You can hit your yearly, and quarterly numbers and be fired on missing a month. Very little team culture - There are some amazing tenured reps that are willing to help but there are few and far in-between. Most reps are just trying to get by and have their heads down and are unwilling to help."
HubSpot,5,45033,Amazing culture where you are genuinely valued!,Senior Product Designer I,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",,"The people, culture, and genuine care for employees is everything it was touted to be and more! There is a reason HubSpot is at the top of GlassDoor and other job transparency sites, and I have loved it here so far. The diversity training and first week onboarding was the BEST onboarding training I have done with any company, and that can be difficult to do remotely. Your health and well-being is genuinely important to others here, and you can feel it, and it creates a great culture of taking care of each other. The perks and benefits are also excellent.","The only con I have ran into is that in my particular area, processes are a bit loosely defined for such a large company. It's not a problem if you are a go-getter and like to figure things out for yourself (which I am), but I would have expected more clearly defined processes to help new-hires understand what is expected and the steps taken to get to the same result. Everyone seems to be doing their own methods which is fine, but that can create inconsistency with end results and doesn't work as well when scaling a team or onboarding new hires. HubSpot DOES seem to know this however, and I have already seen initiatives in place to start creating better/more defined processes."

The culture is extremely inviting, supportive and friendly. The employee benefits are great, and base pay is mediocre.","The training does not keep up with the demand of ever market changes. There is often inconsistent expectations of internal procedures which makes it har to focus on your pipeline. The Contract Management team has become somewhat of a ""catch-all"" for dissatisfied/escalated customers and very billing heavy in light of businesses closing and missing their renewal window. The metrics are constantly changing and the goal post is constantly being moved. Very little opportunities for promotion"
HubSpot,3,45068,Corporate shift causing burnout,Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Cambridge, MA",Wonderful people to work with. Excellent developer tooling. Compensation has improved significantly.,"There's been quite a few high impact people fired in recent months because they were doing ""fine"" for one quarter instead of exceeding expectations. They get a PIP, no clear guidance for improving, ignored by managers and then fired after a month. These are people who have been around for years, previously did well enough to get promoted, and are now suddenly not good enough. They built HubSpot and their reward is being cut off when they stop burning their candle on both ends. Performance measurement has gone from being story based to metrics based and it's hurting morale."
HubSpot,3,45173,GoodBye Old Friend - Not the Same HubSpot,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Cambridge, MA","Excellent, phenomenal products. Customers and Partners live and breath this product and the ecosystem is strong. Marketing and Sales particularly have exceptional strength in the market. The culture built by Dharmesh and Brian was incredible but eventually every employee became a victim. Can’t keep HRBPs because the victim volume incredibly high.","Woke Inc. - Unfortunately, for all of the diversity and inclusion HubSpot espouses it is the antithesis of inclusive when it comes to welcoming non-liberal points of view. C-Suite determine new customers based on slack channel crowd-sourcing to ensure they don’t hurt employees feelings. Everyone is offered an abortion as they please without any sense that various countries and religions take offense. Employees with differing views are shunned and the internal liberal echo chamber is loud. Separately, the lay-offs were a mess. Top performers with highest marks were let go and their managers had no idea after CEO said “we aren’t doing layoffs”. People with many years at the company under their belt with families cut with no reason. Intense metric based micromanagement has created a world of cut throat cover your neck and throw anyone you can under the bus. The mission, the passion, and the camaraderie is gone as an ethos across the employee base. Employees all on an island with no support to connect with others IRL. Pay significantly lower than core competitors."
HubSpot,2,45086,Used to be a Great Place to Work,Customer Support Specialist,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Boston, MA","Decent salary for the postion compared to other job offers on the market, good health insurance","Since Hubspot understaffed support via the 7% workforce reduction earlier this year , and this short staffing has been further exacerbated by massive attrition since, Hubspot's culture has shifted dramatically. Leadership doesnt care about experience, seniority, or history of loyalty in employees. All that matters now is your production numbers this month. There is no context that can explain low numbers and no compassion for employees. I personally know a mentor-type person with years of experience who was cut loose in recent months after their numbers dropped due to stress caused by their move across the country, and the general burn-out culture we work in 40 hours a week. Everyone i know is leaving as quickly as possible. This ship is sinking while on fire"

HubSpot,1,45120,Flipped to Open to work.,Contract Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Seattle, WA","Remote status forever, no set hours, flexible time off.",The pay here sucks. They changed our roles to include calling customers and added a bunch of responsibilities but refuse to pay more. They laid off a bunch of people recently and now there is even more work for everyone. The bar they set for goals is often out of reach and unreasonable considering how many HubSpot customers are canceling their subscriptions. You have the luck of the draw every month to see how many accounts you'll get with cancelations. But you're now also expected to up sell or cross sell. I'm not a sales rep! The worst part is our job is to tell people they can't cancel and be cold hearted to those in dire financial situations. HubSpot no longer cares for the employees or customers. They only care about revenue and forcing people into contracts that they can't get out of.

Right now most support reps are staying due to their unlimited holidays but if this was removed there would be a massive exodus. There is no incentives for hard work and the salaries are mediocre. There was also a feeling that it was impossible to get out of support through internal mobility . People with experience and Master degree being stuck in this team for years.

Literally every way you can imagine. Any real life situation can come up and you will be able to handle it stress free.

HubSpot,2,44743,Mixed Feelings | Misleading Reviews,Corporate Account Executive,Former Employee,,"Pros

- Good sales enablement stack
- Nice hardware for us to use
- Decent Work/Life balance
- HubSpot on your resume
- Week of rest in July
- VQR for sales reps to get quota relief when they take PTO","- Something about asking new hires to leave reviews irritates me. HubSpot has enough new hires to manipulate/skew Glassdoor. I'd recommend sorting out one-line five-star reviews. They are not genuine.

- Leadership is atrocious. The worst that I've ever seen. See, there are two kinds of people at HubSpot in Sales. 1. Those with lots of RSUs understand the HubSpot game (Drink the Cool-Aid and know your place). 2. Folks who want to build their career at a great company are left out to dry.

- Underpaid relative to unrealistic quota. They are not honest about quota attainment and failure is encouraged in many ways as it helps leaders exceed their goals. 

- Product only competes competitively in one area (Marketing)

- Turnover is really bad. No one brings their authentic self to work as you will be judged and mistreated as a result. Believe me, you do not want to be the cranky wheel at HubSpot. 

- Worst AE support I've seen. No one at HubSpot will help you. Not your manager, not your SE (they don't do demos or much at all). You will succeed or fail and it's 100% on you. 

- No exit interview upon departure.

- Fought company to get earned commissions. 

- Managers have off-sites, reps stay and work. Never met a HubSpot colleague in my 2+ years."

They are desperate and hungry to be in the leagues of major tech companies - but at their core, they are extremely dated and broken in bureaucracy. The culture is so toxic, they suck the life out of you by priding themselves on working weekends, skipping holidays and precious family time and celebrations with the hope and prayer for a year end bonus in exchange. This company has the opposite values of any company I'd like to work for long term. There have been so many former employees that have gone to HR about management violating ethics, policies, etc., but the reports are immediately silenced and discarded.

FDM Group,5,45194,Good experience,Consultant,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Houston, TX","Currently FDM allows remote work, which I have greatly appreciated during my time with the company. I’ve gained great experience while working here since I’ve been placed with a large financial client. FDM offers an 8 week training program to prepare you for whatever role you’re seeking. I was in the Business Analysis training, so we learned SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Project management (waterfall and agile/scrum). They even had training on professional etiquette which is great for recent grads. I had an overall good experience while with the company.","Have to sign a 2-year contract for employment, meaning you’re not allowed to quit or else you will incur fees. So Make sure you’re prepared to give them 2 years at the salary they offer! You’re only eligible for salary pay once placed with a client, which starts at about 45k, which increases to 47k, and finally 50k after a certain amount of time. Before being placed with a client, you will make an hourly pay of $15/hr (New York minimum wage- which is where FDM is based out of). If you’re working remotely from another state, understand you will be paying New York taxes as well. Yes the pay is low but this industry won’t look at candidates who have no experience (regardless if you have a degree or not), so I bit the bullet to get 2 years of experience while getting paid instead of paying for these expensive boot camps that are out there."

Meet Many People Going Into The Same Field as You","Recruiters can make enticing promises that no one will explain or apologize for. I had already accepted that taking a job at FDM meant moving away, but a recruiter had alluded to the fact that there was an opportunity in my city he'd tell me about once I had signed up. This, of course, never materialized, and I was pushed into another role in a city over with no explanation on what that was about. 
Little/nebulous amount of choice in which company you work for. It felt like I was thrown at whoever said yes first with very little interest in what other opportunities I had. I was assigned a role in Week 2 of training. (My advice to people in interviewing during training is to keep interviewing regardless of who they think you should say yes to. Or even if you have a role already.)
Training courses taper off in quality after the first 6 - 7 lessons. one course ended in an unsupervised algorithm self-study when the lecturer was apparently also tasked with an important presentation.
Assignment can have nothing to to with your training. In fact, it can actually be a whole other pipeline of training. I went through 8+ weeks of training in one technical pipeline (when it had been know since week 2 that my assignment was something else entirely) and then given 3 week to get two technical certifications, one of which claimed to have required 2 years of experience with a certain technology to be able to obtain.
While FDM allows the company you're contracted with to hire you at the end of two years, it's unclear how interested they are in helping that process along. There's nothing in writing encouraging the other party to make this process timely, and I know of a case where FDM (unbeknownst to the employee) extended a contract with the company without asking. Moreover, FDM seems widely absent from the conversion process."

4) You are locked into 2 year contract with the client; leaving FDM before then incurs a $15K fee (their value for training).

5) Account managers who facilitate client placement vary immensely in quality/professionalism.

6) Minimal support is provided after training is completed; you are mostly on your own to maintain and improve your skills. 

7) Projects done after training but before client placement are poorly managed and have no full-time staff oversight.

-The trainers, for the most part, do a good job. The quality of your training is entirely up to the amount of work you willing to put into it. Don't try? You won't get far.

-The exposure to different clients via interviews and events really helps you to gain an understanding about what corporate looks for in a candidate. (This will be really helpful when you're looking for jobs on your own.)

While some of the points raised are specific to Avanade ASG (Austria, Switzerland, Germany), others are global concerns, which I will clearly identify.

TL;DR: Multiple employees are expressing dissatisfaction with recent changes, limited learning opportunities, and an overwhelming emphasis on chargeability.

Specific concerns:
- Limited interaction and knowledge sharing: While Avanade positions itself as a global company, collaboration between Avanade ASG and other offices seems restricted. Additionally, internal knowledge sharing lacks structure, hindering learning and growth compared to established consulting firms like BCG or McKinsey.
- Management background and focus: The Avanade ASG leadership, largely composed of ex-Accenture and Microsoft personnel, might lack direct customer acquisition experience. This potentially limits client engagement and results in repetitive ""success stories"" without active presales efforts.
- Global reorganization and its impact: Recent changes imposing chargeability on all employees are allegedly dampening morale. Additionally, concerns exist about the lack of focus on developing the sales pipeline.
- Leadership continuity and employee morale: Some new leaders, reportedly involved in previous cultural breakdowns at Accenture, might be contributing to similar concerns at Avanade. Many recent hires have expressed surprise and disappointment with the current company culture, particularly regarding the recent end-of-year review process and lack of bonuses.

Overall, there appears to be a need for addressing employee concerns regarding company direction, learning opportunities, and leadership effectiveness."

Always aim to be your best and continuously learn and build your skills. Also your clients could be anywhere in the US or even in other countries. Before Covid, there was lots of traveling.

That's the biggest con. Other cons are: They toe the MSFT line exceptionally heavily and really only prioritize education to be line with MSFT certs and selling points. So for a holistic technology picture you'll need to do that on your own.

Upper management isn't in touch with the people on the ground.

Management by fear instead of what the company was built on.

A lot of great things too but I was not capable of identifying if it was a good company to work for or not.

You know what? Consultancy companies are, in general, the worst place to look for work-life balance and the best to learn, make money, and grow. Avanade is a consultancy company but it's impressive how it is well served with benefits and culture. If I have to choose a consultancy company to work at, I think here we have a great reality (of course, if compared with other consultancy companies I worked at)

Company Car, a lot of other types of bonuses, discounts on some stores... They even give the possibility to buy Accenture Shares at 15% off. It's a well-structured company with GREAT experts. I mean, ""la crème de la crème"". Microsoft MVP, well-certified and updated people... There's a lot of room for learning","The greatest part of the work comes from Accenture. They usually don't know what they are doing or the technologies involved in the project. I really can't understand why companies decide to spend a lot more money with them (and they then call our experts) instead of coming directly to us. We have great business analysts who are experts in various technologies and ACN people usually can even say what's doable and what is not. It usually is a big problem when the client arrives with a lot of high expectations

Then... it's a consultancy company. Don't expect to have the greatest work-life balance. I don't have anything to complain about it by now but by lucky. Still, a lot of colleagues had to work late or all night long sometimes, even during Christmas or other holidays... But, again, I challenge anyone to name a consultancy company where this is not a reality from time to time. It depends on the project you are in. If you are one of the lucky ones, then enjoy your time."

If you’re unfortunate enough to be placed on their projects it’s a disaster and mix of political games to survive. Accenture’s optimal strategy is to extract maximum value from their clients and deliver minimal in return. To that end Avanade is just a means to achieve this. Competence means nothing if you’re given teams of people with 0 experience in the technologies your delivering in and culture of being transparent about that with your client is none existent. To much middle management Promotion is a politics game and not value or talent driven. Will regularly charge you out at higher grades (sometimes 2x) in order to make profit but are reluctant to promote to those grades despite many years of good performance at those grades. E.g selling people at group manager despite being two grades below. Innovation in projects is lacking. Project delivery leads are vastly different in their frameworks."

They have to check up on their own wellness and do their own reports in the app. Only given directions on how to collect food at stores by a certain time period. They are expected to double check on items. Then they are expected to just deliver to certain places based on the map projections on the app however in this case it does have directions to follow. No coaching on how to engage with customers either. Drivers are expected to communicate to customers politely even if they don’t know how to do so. Expected to know how to take clear and proper photos of food items and delivery locations. Sometimes there are other scenarios that riders are not prepared for like being forced to take 2 orders at 1 time or restaurants taking too long to prepare the food. Not much growth opportunities here, mainly just social skills and geographical skills. The tasks are always strongly correlated to each other without much variety and is extremely repetitive."

They constantly change KPI targets to make them unreachable so that employees are unable to unlock the benefits and thus also their full salary.

Goal post is constantly being moved for employees and employees are expected to take on extra roles and work for no extra compensation.

No direction for growth and constant restructuring other than leadership getting to keep their jobs unless they get into a scandal like the ex ceo who divulged private information to the public when it was still under discussion

Leadership will never answer questions directly and when they do it's the most non answer possible where they dance around it

I don't recommend working here as they will constantly lowball you with your salary even after promotions. 

They will promise you a mid year raise for your promotion in the beginning of the year and stab you in the back and say the midyear raise is only applicable to those who got promoted in the midyear cycle"

There have been multiple CEO and executive replacements just in the past year. If you're just looking for any job, sure go ahead and apply, but don't have any short term career goals you're trying to achieve because you might suddenly be laid off before you achieve them.

Also, they are obsessed with process here. Too much focus on process (written documents, going through committees and reviews etc) that it takes forever to actually get to build anything.

Once hired by the company, Food Panda HK will require you to download an application specifically designed for riders/cyclists. Once you open the app, a calendar section will open up that will allow you to choose a time schedule, allowing you to either work for 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, or the entire day. Absences or failure to show up once a schedule is selected doesn't mean termination or punishment. It just means that you get sent to a ""lower-tier"" group of riders who get to pick their shifts/schedules at a much later time compared to the ""high-tier"" batch of riders who never miss a schedule or time-slot. This all means that you can choose when to work, for how long, and if you wanna work everyday, every other day, even one time a week!","Try not to work during the day time if possible. It is better to work at night, perhaps from 8-9PM onwards. This will eliminate the most annoying variable you will encounter which is traffic. When working at night, you can average 100-120 HKD per hour as a cyclist. Riders can earn way more than that (Usually Double the amount but the distance from restaurant to customer is usually longer). Sometimes, the rider app is unstable or no orders will come your way, so that means you probably won't earn that day. To be fair, this happens like 5 percent of the time. Lunch time can be a hassle due to the surge of orders but that also means that you can earn almost 100 dollars in less than 30 minutes."

At local level it's a dog-eat-dog world to survive, but in regional/global, you can be 'repurposed' to a new function if you're not performing or don't like what you're doing. It's a wonder how they're still pushing for EBITDA+."
