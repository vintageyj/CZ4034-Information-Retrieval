Netflix,5.0,2023-01-30,high performing environment fantastic benefits trust and results earn a lot of freedom,former employee more than 5 years,marketing director,"Los Angeles, CA",great benefits best salary around beautiful offices and you will work amongst some of the smartest folks you have ever met plus you are talking about tv and movies all day its a fun job,the company has grown rapidly over the last few years and during covid the previous way of onboarding and building trust was much harder to achieve i was at netflix new many growth phases and this one is definitely the hardest there are a ton of talent people in the marketing department that have been there a long time eg more than 4 years but not a lot of upward mobility so it feels like folks are getting restless it has also become a much more political environment where it feels like leadership is most focused on decision making based on perception vs what is best for the work and the teams if you are a used to a political environment this may not bother you
