I ordered this item because of the great price. It was a bit of a gamble because there was no pictures or details about the particular item other than it being a grade B. On arrival I was over the moon. Item was in great condition. The piece missing out of the box that probably made it grade B instead of grade A I found somewhere else. In total much much cheaper than anywhere. We‚Äôll done CEX,1
"As title. I was sent my preorder items immediately and have waited potentially since the 16th June release date.
On Friday 1st July the item finally arrived. I checked the box for damage and proceeded to open. I checked the receipt to make sure it was correct.
Then I proceeded to open the product to find out the wrong colour had been sent, despite receipt showing correct model! This not only did not match bought accessories, but due to receipt not matching would have nulled the warranty! How this happened has never been confirmed to me.
I immediately used live chat to get a return quest, and as of 9th July I am still awaiting any update after them receiving the product back several days ago.

I missed a huge Cardiff Food Festival event that I had planned to document with the new camera. All I got was a ""Sorry"". Not even a offer to preemptively send the correct one while still in stock!

Therefor I have decided for each week of delay, I shall remove one star and update this review.

*Update as of 20th July 2022*
This has truly been a curse to get hold of, but the latest issue is not Wex's fault. The delivery driver delivered to the wrong address. Wex has been nothing but helpful making calls, trying to interview the driver, and get some answers to what has been going on. I really cannot fault how helpful they have been despite the weird circumstances around this.
Yes I am still currently deviceless, and missed 2 major events, but they have promised to get this solved as soon as I can speak to my neighbours (who have been on holiday all week) to make sure they do/do not have it.",1

"Background: I bought a Denon surround sound system 6 years ago (a really positive experience). However, the gentleman who sold the system upsold me an extended warranty (6 Year Chargeable Guarantee).

Normally, I never take an extended warranty, but the sales person wasn't pushy and explained that if I didn't use it I could come back and get my money back after 6 years. So rather sceptically I took the warranty and in an unusual fit of organisation put a reminder in a calendar and stored the receipt safely.

Fast forward 6 years and it's time to reclaim my warranty money. First I checked online as I cynically thought they might have removed this deal, but no it's still available. So I set off to the Sheffield store expecting this to be a complete nightmare to sort out (paperwork to fill in, all kinds of blockers to getting a refund).

I was wrong, I showed my receipt to the sales advisor (David I believe) within two minutes I had the cost refunded to my card.

I'm not sure why I thought this wouldn't be straightforward, every interaction I've ever had with Richer Sounds has been positive.

Thank you Richer Sounds, it's been a while since bought anything from you but it is great to see your customer service levels remain exceptionally high and when I'm next in the market for AV kit you will be my first port of call.",1

I throughly enjoyed choosing all my PC components on their website and thought their prices were reasonable. One I placed my order I eagerly awaited for my order to move through the categories ranging from pre-production and dispatched. My order did take a while on pre-production but I'm guessing that because of the component shortage at the moment. The customer service was also helpful as I had a few questions on different occasions and the were answered. The Pc was delivered by a courier so it arrived quickly. When my Pc arrived it was packed well and preformed exceptionally well. In conclusion Pcspecialist is a great alternative to building if your inexperienced like me or just lazy (also like me),1

"This was my first experience of using Tayna.
My BMW bike had died on a trip earlier that day (Sunday, 7th Aug 22), fortunately started with jump leads from a friend‚Äôs bike.
Once home, we found my bike still had the original battery in from 2008 (I thought this had been replaced long ago at a routine service).
Two friends strongly recommended Motobatt.
A brief internet search gave very good reviews for Tayna in north Wales.
So I phoned, and was very impressed to be able to speak a real person, even though it was late Sunday afternoon.
My since apologies, not sure of his name (Ethan? Owen?).
He was exceptionally helpful & thorough.
He double and triple checked which Motobatt corresponded to my reg no & to my previous battery, and confirmed my own provisional research.
He also checked online the dimensions of the Motobatt battery Vs the old battery, to ensure dimensions were OK.
He profusely apologised that the delivery charges to Northern Ireland are now higher than to the rest of the UK (as a result of Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol) - not his fault at all, obviously, nor my fault either.
He explained that Tayna already absorb half of the ¬£30 delivery charge to Northern Ireland anyway.
Battery arrived 3 days later.
I fitted it this week.
I am very impressed with the battery, & very very impressed with Tayna‚Äôs service and expert advice.
Sincere thanks.",1

The company you use for deliveries (Arrowxl) are the worst. Paid to have the item unwrapped but they tried to leave it still wrapped.

"Wow, Absolutely recommend Pc Specialist.
We evaluated every option for the purchase of our sons PC.
Options
: second hand, we dismissed as the value of the warranty of new parts outweighed any saving. We wanted to guarantee no further costs for a number of years without parts breaking down. Plus, old software versus the latest software.
Second option
A local Specialist: could not compete with named components at cost price and compromised the quality of these components to add the mark up for specialist knowledge, compatability and build.
Third option
Buy from PC specialist:
In a nutshell, it seemed the best value and a no brainer to choose the value of high end components, with the latest software, with warranty, guaranteed compatabilty and assembly.
Absolutely delighted with our purchase. PC specialists in every essence! Ordering was easy, communication, build process, order tracking and delivery could not have been better. Thank you!",1

"I've used Intel CPU's for years, I thought I'd have a change and go for my first AMD CPU, I'm very happy with the result, With the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X matched with the ASUS CROSSHAIR VIII HERO WIFI with 32GB RAM, 8GB NVIDIA GEFORCE RTX 3070 Ti and the amazing ASUS ROG Strix XG27AQ HDR Monitor. It's one heck of a powerful gaming machine, it's played everything I could throw at it, amazingly fast and no problems at all.

I usually hand build my own gaming pc's but this time, I wanted a change and buy a high end computer, I choose PC Specialist Ltd, they do take time to build and test the machine and for good reason, they want you to have the best experience with a stable platform, espicially if you have requested overclocking.

At times, I did feel like a little kid waiting for that present to arrive by looking daily at the latest update order notes, please be patient, you'll be happy with the results :-)",1

Excellent service and speedy delivery.,1
"I ordered a custom built pc for the first time and I didn't know much about what parts I was picking, after I finished selecting and placed the order I then emailed them asking for any advice on whether the parts I picked were suitable for what I wanted. I got a swift reply advising me to change / upgrade different bits to make it VR ready and I was really pleased with the honesty as they could have raised the price more.

Once I finally got my pc and set it up, it took me roughly 2 hours of difficulty dealing with the WiFi as the signal strength was terrible, I then called for advice and they said that there was antennas to install, there wasn't a mention of this at any point nor in the booklet so I was surprised as I've never seen a pc with an antenna before.

Overall, I'm very pleased with my interaction and the pc is absolutely amazing and I'm very happy :)",1

"The service is as smooth as possible - you download a small executable file, it gathers the information about the system, it opens a webpage where it tells you what can you improve. You select what you want, and the order comes in your mail 1-2 days later. Inside there are instructions on how to change your components. It's idiot proof. I wish there were more computer upgrade services like that!",1

Like many other reviewers I was not on social media but decided to join Twitter and follow the advice to contact them via this method.

Chris got in touch and although it took a bit of time I am now up and running. Chris kept all of his promises, called when he said he would and messaged if he needed more time - I was kept fully informed at every stage.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Craig in the faults department who also kept a promise to check in the next day to ensure that everything was working.

If all staff had the same attitude as these guys there would be very few issues.

Popped in today to take a look at the OM-5; store is still being set up as some display stands haven't arrived but spent around 30 minutes in-store with Matt looking at the OM-5 and alternatives.
Unfortunately the package I want is currently out of stock - not a problem and i placed an order with Matt and Wex will let me know when it is in-store.
Been an online customer of Wex and had no problems at all but really good to be able to pop into a local store and talk face to face with knowledgeable staff with the time to advise you.

"I‚Äôve been with BT for two years now and they‚Äôve never let me down because when my WiFI speed under the 100Mbs, they fixed it within a matter of hours‚Ä¶

My BT mobile devices and plan are amazing which has helped me/my family out massively, so thank you for that‚Ä¶

I spoken to someone last week about my bill as I was overdue by a fair bit due to me over spending on the BT TV app but they understood my current situation and helped me with my BT bill‚Ä¶

When I‚Äôve spoken to the customer service at BT, they‚Äôve always been so friendly towards me like ‚ÄúAsking how I‚Äôm doing‚Äù which helps with my confidence to speak to the BT customer service team..

The only down side I‚Äôve got at the moment is the ‚ÄúEE-WiFi Box‚Äù as it connects with a ok signal then after a while it starts to flash red until i switch it off by the wall and when it turns back on the ‚ÄúEE-WiFi Box‚Äù reconnects‚Ä¶?

BT Ratings from me:
1: BT Broadband - 9.5/10
2: BT TV (VIP) - 9.0/10
3: BT Mobile - 10/10
4: BT Landline - N/A
5: BT Gaming (Xbox GP) - 10/10

Please ignore the negative reviews as some people just love to negotiate things about others but in my opinion, I would definitely recommend going with BT as you‚Äôll be amazed‚Ä¶

It arrived when it was meant to. I will buy using PC Specialst again if I ever need to buy a new PC. The build software on the website keeps everything in check as well. If your components don't work together, it will let you know what is needed to rectify the problem. The cost of getting the company to build the rig is not that much more than getting the parts yourself, just without the hassle, and you then have a guarantee for the entire build, not for individual parts you have purchased yourself. I would definitely recommend it.",1

Last year I decided to sign up to Now TV Broadband as I had been with Talk Talk for 3yrs and had nothing but issues.
I have to say, Now TV Broadband was probably the best broadband I've ever had. I only had the WIFI drop once in 12 months and when I called them, they fixed the issue within minutes.

Today I had to cancel my Now TV Broadband contract as I'm moving to Virgin (purely because I can't get any TV channels in my new property unless I have Virgin and it's cheaper to get the package that includes WIFI) but I will miss the smoothness of Now TV Broadband and I will certainly look to use them again in the future. :-)",1

Ash answered, I could tell by his voice and the way he spoke he was a genuine caring person. The line went quiet and I thought he was gone. I got frustrated and by the time we could hear each other again I wasn't in a good place. This amazing man took the time to talk to me, calm me down and helped with my query. I was in tears because I had shouted and he was just trying to help me. He deserves good customers all day long.

They have traditional 24 month contracts as i don‚Äôt like 36 month contracts that o2 offer. I was keeping an eye on iphone 14 pro max 512gb phone for a while as it was saying 2-4 weeks for delivery but randomly on Sunday it said in stock ready for next day delivery and i was happy to upgrade online however after placing the order i got an email saying some details don‚Äôt match with o2 so they needed my latest bill which I emailed rightaway and i was impressed that everything was done on a Sunday before 4 pm which meant my shiny new iPhone arrived next day. They have excellent communication process as they keep you informed at every stage of what is happening with the order.
I was confident doing online order via mpd knowing it is part of ao.com as that is a big online brand.
Phone was delivered with sim next day via dpd.
I already helped my wife upgrade to iPhone 13 earlier this year via mpd so this is our second experience and I‚Äôm sure we will be using mpd again in future.",1

"I ordered 2 16GB modules for my Dell workstation on Friday and received them first class post on Monday. The most time consuming aspect was removing the cables and cover from my workstation which lives under my desk. I then removed the one original 8GB module from a white bank and installed the two 16 GB modules in the two banks coloured white. I reinstalled the 8GB in slot 2, coloured brown. It is essential to press the modules firmly in place, waiting for the reassuring click as the clips at each end return to the fully upright position.

My daughter then tried to contact them to cancel but could not find a direct telephone number, customer service or even a postal address. So it was decided to cancel the debit card. THEN! they started contacting me with ‚Äòyour details need updating‚Äô etc., which I ignored thinking they were dispensed with.
But no! I have found that they are still taking the subscriptions somehow but HOW??
The bank yesterday gave me a number which hopefully will be of use to all the other people they have shafted mentioned these reviews. The info is Debit card disputes 0345 300 6699.",1
"I used PC Specialist to get a new PC that would help my son in VFX animation and gaming and they didn't disappoint, they have a huge selection to choose from. I would say that the only change I would make is if a part is out of stock then they make a recommendation for the replacement. If you know your products it's OK but for a novice like me it would have been helpful to recommend a replacement instead of showing all of them.

They kept us informed about the build, which was really quick and delivery. In total the entire thing took two weeks and we're so happy with it.",1

I've had around 5 different orders in the past 2 weeks and they all came when they said one got lost but turned up a few days later which was the fault of evri not of optimal prints..

The AIO I specified, using the online tool, was as useful as ever, choosing that over the other contender - a mini PC which I also configured. It arrived in good time. Set up was easy. Getting rid of OneDrive and Quick Access took a bit longer! It is now loaded and has been well received by my wife who has enjoyed a seamless change over.

Honestly, unless you absolutely must have your delivery from Wex on a specific day, there's little point in choosing something other than the free delivery if you know that what you've ordered was in stock.

"I had two equipment rehearsals at RC Leeds. First demo was with Anthony who set up a Cambridge Audio Evo 150 paired with Focal Aria 926 speakers. After putting the setup through some of my playlists I was left wanting some extra.

Anthony arranged for some Dev Tec D15s for me to try as I was keen to hear them, at the time they were heavily discounted.

My second visit I was hosted by Paul who kindly set up the D15s for me to try. It‚Äôs fair to say the Focal were instantly a winner over them in my opinion.

I then auditioned a Naim Unity Atom as this unit uses an AB amp. Much better! Paul then set up a Cambridge Audio CXN V2 with CXA81, with the Focals. I was sold.

So after doing my online research, reading reviews and thinking I knew what I wanted I am so glad I went to visit the guys at RC. I‚Äôm sat here very much enjoying my HiFi and I‚Äôm very grateful that we have RC stores with sound studios. Cheers",1
This is the second purchase from Tayna and yet again service was excelent.,1

He was extremely knowledgable and honest about differences and what the various spec terminology meant.
On this basis, and the price match offered, we ordered a new TV which was delivered as promised in a couple of days.
We also added a wall bracket. Unfortunately the wall bracket had some fixings missing, which required a trip to the local hardware store.
On contacting Richer Sounds to let them know, Keal promptly called back and was very apologetic. As a gesture of goodwill for our trouble, he refunded ¬£20.
Overall, our experience has been superb, and although things sometimes do go wrong, the aftercare was without fault.
Keal was at all times courteous, knowledgable, and never giving an hard sell - well done, customer service is a dying art these days!
Researching the company further, it appears their loyalty and employee care is exemplary; which obviously shows.
Can‚Äôt recommend them enough..",1

Richer sounds are a great source of expertise and knowledge at sensible prices and who treat their staff as well as they treat their customers - like a John Lewis for A-V.,1
"The delivery was well managed and very friendly, so that I was at my ease and knew when to expect a coarse time slot and then notification that the delivery was ten minutes away from arriving.
It was all very quick and efficient. Before I knew it the deed was done and we were alone once more; my freezers and myself.

It must be magic, but now the new and old are sitting next to each other and the slightly broken Kelvinator device seems to have rallied, doubtless happy to have a Beko friend that can just chill out instead of the other one which only foams and gets in a bit of a spin when called upon for action. Don't you just love anthropomorphism?

I also love my fridge/freezers to do what they do best, so thank you once again AO.

Regards,
Ian_",1

"The part arrived quickly but, as I suspected, was not exactly compatible with my Belling Format Cooker. However, it was easy to modify the part and transfer the bit from the original Halogen plate (2 connectors on new part but 4 on original halogen element). It all works fine. Price was more reasonable than many other places and hence it was worth the trouble to do some minor modifications which did not influence the safety of the device but save me having to work out what the other 2 connections were for.",1

He explained that the calls I was receiving were most likely a scam from someone who wanted to pretend to be the Carphone Warehouse.

When I first contacted Shell the customer service person told me that this wasn‚Äôt possible and confirmed that if I changed my Direct Debit date my Billing Date would also change. I knew this could not be correct so I made a complaint to Shell .
I received a very prompt response from the Shell complaints department from a girl called Agata who was very helpful and apologetic confirmed that I had indeed been misinformed . She traced the call and escalated the case to ensure this misinformed information does not happen to other customers and she happily explained the Billing system and adjusted my account accordingly

"I went there today (09.08.2019) to buy a new phone and bought a Motorola G7 Power in black. This was after going to the Albion Street store where the phone I was looking was unavailable but Dominique was really helpful and told me which store to go to.

Upon arriving at the Headrow store, Ashlie greeted me and for the whole time I was at the store, she was amazing and provided some of the best customer service. She could see I was upset as this was big purchase as my old phone was unable to be fixed and I have a tight budget as a student who only works part time. As my old phone was still under contract, she looked to see if I could get my new phone on my contract and thoroughly searched every option in order to help me in getting a new phone. I hope this gets passed on to her managers so they can give her the praise she deserves as she really did go above and beyond and I am very grateful to her.",1

"Ignore the bad reviews,

So my experience with pc specialist is different to say the least, despite all the odds against my pc they pulled through,

So got this pc off my friend and happily transferred the warranty,

The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was having to pay ¬£16.20 for a box to send back the pc in but no matter because they collected it anyway without charging me the ¬£35.00

So no complaints there, Id say my biggest battle was explaining my issues building pcs myself I know how tricky they can be to deal with, and despite the pc passing all the stress tests, for 3 days they still approved my request for a motherboard upgrade,

To give this PC a fighting chance for gaming in 2022,

So the very kind head engineer said speak to the team and paid for my new motherboard on the phone without a hitch, I must say I‚Äôm very pleased with the outcome,

And from what I‚Äôve been told they will even see what SSD mounts/screws they can find for the old motherboard in the warehouse so it can be used again.

In my book that‚Äôs recycling at it‚Äôs finest.

And even had a graphics card in it without warranty as the previous owner of that wasn‚Äôt available they still contacted msi on my behalf, and just made solid suggestions,

A big thanks to Liam today aswell in customer services who sorted my upgrade from the stock,

Now I have a PC that will be perfect for 1080p gaming with future upgradeability,

Yea I‚Äôm slightly upset they couldn‚Äôt find my issue but as per there policy they have to replicate all issues, now I know this pc has labour warranty left and will do for the next 2 years at least.

now that is a happy customer even if I did have to pay for my needed upgrade.",1

I was slightly concerned about ordering a phone online and after reading some of the previous reviews, my boyfriend and I got in contact with QMF and asked a series of questions so that we were completely clear on the process from ordering to receiving the device. QMF replied very quickly and I felt very confident with my purchase!

On top of the great customer service, quick response time and helpful feedback - I received my device quicker than the amount of time advised.

Furthermore, the phone is suggested to be in 'GOOD' condition, however I cannot see a single scratch anywhere and so far it's working without a glitch!

By Monday evening the full amount was in my bank account . I only decided to sell the phone the previous Tues . So within less than a week I‚Äôd received the label , posted the phone & received full payment . I don‚Äôt know how they did it so fast but I‚Äôm super impressed.

"I replaced my PC which I purchased from PC Specialist ten years ago. This was used nearly every day and was only replaced because It was slow compared to modern PCs with faster SSD drives. It also wasn't modern enough to upgrade to Windows 11.
I configured the new PC, and even after paying extra for their 3 Year Gold Warranty (2 Year Collect & Return, 2 Year Parts, 3 Year Labour), it was still cheaper than near equivalent specification models from other mainstream PC companies.
When my PC arrived, I phoned their customer support with a query. This was dealt with quickly and resolved to my satisfaction.
If this new PC lasts as long as my first one, I'll be very happy.",1

This was my first time using Envirofone as I normally use Music Magpie. Music Magpie didn‚Äôt have my handset as an option with it being so new but Envirofone did and gave me a good valuation. I sent the handset via special delivery due to the value and it arrived with them Friday. Given it had been the weekend I was quite impressed to receive an email Monday afternoon to say my phone had been processed and payment sent and I had the money in my account by 6pm. I was concerned as after sending my item I came across quite a few negative reviews so I emailed them to ask how long processing my handset would take to try and ease my concern. I got a prompt response from their customer service team and I simply can‚Äôt fault Envirofone after my experience and would gladly use them again. Thanks.,1

Very happy with this PC and would absolutely recommend PCSpecialist to anyone looking for a pre-built PC or laptop. Their website is very easy to use, allowing you to view, select and pick the parts you want without worrying about compatibility issues. Their customer support is excellent too, with replies received within a day of contacting them. Also, their site does a great job of telling you what is happening at each stage of the build process.

My PC took 13 days to be built and arrive from ordering it online and this was during December too. Superb stuff!",1
"I recently had the pleasure of trying out the Brand Ambassador App and it's been a great experience. The app is incredibly intuitive and easy to use, making it a breeze to manage my ambassador campaigns. It has all the features I need to keep track of my campaigns and keep track of my performance. It also allows me to easily create and share content with my followers, which is a great way to engage and grow my audience. The customer support team was also incredibly helpful whenever I had any questions. All in all, I highly recommend the Brand Ambassador App for anyone looking to manage their ambassador campaigns in an efficient and effective manner.",1

The driver Andy (who was on his own) then loaded the old machine onto his van to take it away to recycle it, removed the wrapping on the new one and then helped manoeuvre it around some awkward corners and up a couple of steps in my bungalow to help place it where the old machine had been.

Although the selection pages can be a bit daunting, it gives a wealth of options and you end up with a bespoke machine. There is a handy check at the end to make sure everything will fit together.

I recently reluctantly purchased the g tech extended HT cordless hedge trimmer after being quoted nearly ¬£1k for a man with a machine to trim down an over grown hedge in the garden on my behalf. I am so glad i decided to do this job myself. I am very impressed with this device which is light and easy to operate and surprisingly powerful. I have managed to cut down most of said hedge in a single charge - around an hour of use - and i am confident of finishing it with the 2nd charge. We are talking about 12 ft in places down to around 8 feet. There isnt much vibration and the noise isn't too bad at all. I have previously spent hours and days working on this hedge without getting very far - with a bottom of the range own brand corded hedge trimmer from a well known supermarket. So glad i researched this subject a bit and found this superior device. A great investment. Thanks gtech ;),1

"The service I received from PC Specialist was excellent. They built me exactly the computer I needed - this is what they do, of course - and when I made a small request (telling them what three components I would put in the PC when I got it so they could make my life a bit easier) they responded swiftly saying they would do it.

The PC took a while to arrive but that was expected during pre-Christmas busy times, and it was in line with their quoted timescales. When the PC arrived the build quality and care shown was top notch. They'd done what I'd asked them to do, and within minutes I had put the three things in that I already had, and I was ready to set up my new computer.

I'm up and running on it now with everything transferred across from my old PC. I am absolutely delighted with what I've got and I have no hesitation recommending PC Specialist to anyone who wants a computer built for them to a high quality and a reasonable price.",1

"I‚Äôve been abit of a dinosaur about my telly, a Sony Bravia, but I think they sold me the last dumb telly 10 years ago, no interweb access, 32‚Äù screen.

I went to Curry‚Äôs Truro. A very helpful, knowledgeable service assistant (Shannon?) approached me, but without being overbearing, talked me through options, within 10 mins she had ordered my new 43‚Äù telly, arranged delivery for a day I was off work, and agreed a set up installation plan for the day.

I was called this morning when the guys were 20 minutes away, they hooked the new TV up in minutes, took away the packaging. Only issue we had was that the new telly was too wide to fit on an old Curry‚Äôs Corner TV unit. But actually, that‚Äôs a bonus! I dismantled it today, it went to the recycling centre. It‚Äôs time was up!

But the two gentlemen generously took my old tv down a flight of stairs to my garage, they could not have been more engaging.

They also advised that an old DVD player could be connected up, I just need a Scart to HMDI connector.

End to end brilliant experience üòÄ",1

I had purchased a another well known brand and was very disappointed by it, wish I‚Äôd bought the Gtech model originally. Delivery was very prompt and keep informed throughout. My only issue is not having a backup battery that can be used once the only battery runs out. Unlike a lot of hoovers it‚Äôs not top heavy so no bulky and awkward strains on my wrists which I like. It‚Äôs powerful and doesn‚Äôt clog up with pet hair, easy to clean and it‚Äôs hand held set is great on stairs. Comes with spare filters and accessories.Happy with my my purchase.",1
"So these guys are just MEGA. Have been buying stuff through them for years. Most recently bought a new TV from Bath, and on reflection I could not have been higher maintenance, or more dense with my buying process. Long story short, I messed up what I went for initially (totally my bad and entirely because I was going for something waaaay too big), woke up the following day and just thought ‚Äúoh dear god‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve messed up and will be stuck with something I should never have gone with‚Äù‚Ä¶ called them, and they were immense. Now have the correct tv on my wall and super chuffed with it. The bottom line is these guys are like tech ninjas, and are genuinely after the best outcome for you, not driven in any way by cost of products. They don‚Äôt ‚Äòsell‚Äô you anything, it‚Äôs a professional service instead, with honest/genuine opinions from very well informed people, that often results in buying less expensive products. They get it‚Äôs all about looking after people so they come back time and time again‚Ä¶ and that ultimately, sticky customers is what what you get. Immense business model that‚Äôs a win-win for them and for customers. Have been testing their patience for years, and I‚Äôm blown away by them. For most recent experience, massive thank you Tom - from the high-maintenance dense dude who bought a TV clearly too big for his situation! Keep up the awesome work, you‚Äôre all properly excellent.",1

Also advised me on the best way to move forward with repair to dishwasher as various methods could have been employed. I went with a 6 month plan which was the same cost as paying up front and gives me peace of mind for this 6 month period. Having made an appointment for my Hotpoint Dishwasher Repair, I was kept up to-date on appointment and the engineer arrived promptly. He was quiet, polite, hardworking and pulled out all the stops to make sure I was happy with the end result. If I'd just found a local plumber to do the job, I don't think I'd have been as happy.

They said they would, but my monthly payment would increase and I would also have to pay for installation. I really was disappointed with their offer after being a loyal customer so transfered to virgin. I am really happy with all your services, and my monthly payment which is actually less than I paid to Sky, also includes my mobile phone charge and overseas phone calls which I never had with Sky...so very happy!",1

Very fortunately this company has replicas and saved my lovely old vacuum which is now working again brilliantly. The delivery was very quick and the filter fitter perfectly.

"I bought yet another camera from Wex. Like all the things I buy from Wex it was as described and arrived within a few days.

If the cost is over ¬£50 it's free delivery within three days. You can pay more for quicker delivery or pick up in store for free if you live nearby to a store.

I had the opportunity to return the camera if I didn't want it for any reason - that is the law at the moment. This is presumably at my expense but I guess if it was faulty or not as described then that might be different.

I haven't had a faulty item after buying about 40 lenses and cameras so I don't know what that process would be like. Almost all Wex secondhand gear comes with a years guarantee unless otherwise stated.

Yes, I'm a collector of old Nikon gear. It has to be cheap but in good nick.

I have found a good professional seller on ebay. They have been good for the couple of cheap cameras I have bought but it's a 30 day guarantee. If you are spending big MONEY then look at Wex.

Some other second hand gear sellers with three letter names also sell stuff that seems reasonably priced. Look at the guarantee and the usually hidden cost of delivery (¬£6.00) before buying. Delivery costs can bite you.

Things can change after reviews are written so check out Wex's delivery costs before buying as well.",1

"I am awarding 5 Stars to Ebrahiem in Customer Services for his helpful, knowledgeable and friendly manner in trying to sort out my bill query and also for his patience in explaining things.

Regrettably Shell started sending me estimated bills in December despite my actual readings being submitted on time. This resulted in numerous phone calls/emails to Shell. Despite giving them the up to date readings they requested during 3 phone calls, they still continued to send estimated bills. This has now happened again for the January bill.

I had also been told to change my readings date on 3 separate occasions by 3 different staff members and Ebrahiem has today clarified the best dates.

Ebrahiem has now assured me that the revised bill will show my actual readings and not estimates and has also clarified some other queries which was greatly appreciated. Consequently I am now hopeful that my future bills will run smoothly (fingers crossed!) as it is time consuming for both myself and Shell Energy Customer Services having to sort out their errors.",1

The ability to make some extra cash/gift certificates as well as getting your own discount codes is so fun and really takes the work out of ambassadorships. My only complaint is the app and other technical areas could use some serious updating/reconfiguring as the app errors can sometimes get on your nerves.

When she realised I was struggling financially, she did not hesitate in giving advice on how to keep costs to a minimal. Alongside with Flavia Cretu, a paralegal, I received an astounding service that made me feel I was their most important Client!
They would always pick my calls and respond to my emails and remained professional all through. I remember a time when Natalie was sending me emails and sending forms to the court on her hospital bed, just so as to meet deadlines!!
I am glad I followed their recommendation, which gave me the outcome I was expecting. I couldn't have asked for a better deal. You guys were simply amazing. Thank you Natalie!! Thank you Flavia!!",1
"I visited the Braintree branch on Saturday with a phone that had an unresponsive screen (so I couldn't access it at all). They helped me choose my new Huawei phone (I was already happy with the brand) and then Olli and the team went above and beyond to access my old phone and transfer everything to my new one. I can't thank them enough, Olli was determined to sort it out for me and they even stayed late for me. I'm so impressed with their service, I shall be recommending them to everyone!",1

"I've been using PC Specialist since 2006 and have always found them excellent. My latest order (I think my seventh with them) was for a gaming computer. I have more or less stopped bothering to compare their prices against buying components separately; the price difference is usually tiny (sometimes it even saves money) and it's nice not to have to build it yourself and have to worry about electrocuting the CPU or buying a mismatched component. The initial queue took a while (24 days in ""pre-production"" i.e. waiting to be built), which probably reflected a surge in demand once graphics cards became more available again around Aug 2021, but building, testing, and delivery were quick after that. The machine was pre-overclocked and neatly built, and has worked perfectly so far. Good work.",1

"Ordering was easy. Information on delivery was helpful and delivery guys were very pleasant and polite.
My only negative would be that on your web site the picture of the person for the chat line was very intrusive. It obliterated a lot of relevant information and I could not find a way to get rid of it. It was annoying to the point where I gave up and ordered my dishwasher from another company. As it happens they were out of stock so I returned to you but I suggest you either reposition the picture or even better, make it so customers can delete it.
Other than that the whole transaction was flawless and I would definitely buy from you again and recommend you.",1

"I ordered a custom desktop pc from them on the 10th of November and it was delivered on the 8th of December. The lead time was totally understandable as some specs I picked were the most up-to-date ones like 12th Gen Intel CPU, DDR5 RAM, 3080ti GPU, and a new CPU-compatible motherboard.

Since it was the first gaming desktop pc I ever configured (I've always been a laptop user), I was so excited and a bit worried about how and where to do. So, I wrote down a long email with indicating all the specs I was thinking and all the questions and concerns I had. I copy-pasted the email, changed the contact names, and sent it out to 5 most well-known online pc building companies.

PcSpecialist was the first to reply in detail to all my questions and concerns (Special thanks to Michael Doran from Technical Support team). Frankly, no other companies took it that much seriously, and some even didn't come back to me at all. I spoke with him in a daily basis with so many back-and-forth emails.

So, I decided to place my order. The only thing I could criticise a bit was the pre-built process being not much transparent. It would be great if I could follow up which components were ready and which were not.

As you all know, gamers never grow up, I was literallt waiting the courier (DPD) in front of the window. The courier guy parked the street and literally drop a big box from the back of the truck. At that moment, time stopped for me. So, I wanted to open the package with him watching me just in case there is any damage. There were literally no damage at all due to very well protection applied by PCS.

I set up the PC in only a few minutes, and it was ready to go already. I've been enjoying it for almost 10 days. Not even a minor problem has occurred yet.

I hope this long review would help people who are thinking about buying/configuring a new gaming PC, but unsure about where to do it, or how to do it just like me.

One last thing to add up, I set up the same or similar configuration with all competitor companies, but PCS was best in terms of the price/value.

I'd definitely recommend them at all.

Thanks everyone in the PCS team.",1

"I've been with Vodafone for almost 15 years and I'm surprised to say that I've never had any real issues.

Had several contracts and sim only plans and they've been very fast with good coverage of the Scottish Highlands. I've had all my issues resolved by their support teams too, especially through live chat.

Over the past couple of years I've also signed up to their full fibre broadband after a recent city fiber installation and it's excellent. We are quite heavy users so we are quick to notice down times, and I'm yet to experience one.

I really appreciate the very useful free add-on of the USB dongle to use your home allowance anywhere you travel.

Assuming your area doesn't have any Vodafone specific issues such as poor mast coverage or oversubscribed broadband - something all suppliers suffer from - I'd recommend Vodafone any day of the week.",1
"Great staff who were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Not like at some other well known electrical retailers where the staff look like they don't want to be there.

Used before and will definitely use again",1

Having spoken with Dyson's customer service people in South Africa (of all places )eventually reached an impasse. Not willing to waste any more time dealing with incompetent call handlers, I decided to test my consumer rights & contacted Argos with my tale of woe !!

Very impressed with their response . As I had an email from Dyson along with other relevant paperwork I was able to return the machine immediately to my local Argos & received a full refund on the spot as Dyson no longer manufacture my hoover it seems .

So well done Argos you have a very content customer !",1

"I've already filled in a review of this purchase!
Price, availability, and assistance from Currys staff were all 5 star. And the Epson printer is a quality piece of kit, though it seems to have an irritating feature of wanting you to use an iPhone and the Epson App to send a scan to iCloud, rather than just using Apple's AirPrint to send the scan to my iMac (as the HP printer does). (I try not to use iCloud, as it can fill up and cost unnecessary money). I can divert the scan to my iMac using Apple's AIrPort, but I still seem to need to use an iPhone and an App to do so, which is an unnecessary waste of time.
I've since also discovered that the print definition of the Epson ET2850 Ink Tank printer (that I wanted, based on reviews) is not as sharp as that on my (bought in 2019) Hewlett Packard OfficeJet 6960, if you are printing very detailed things like Ordnance Survey maps, with the Epson's coloured areas fainter than from the HP printer, and the small text is less 'dark black' than the HP ink-cartridge prints. But it's OK, uses a different print technology, and should be a lot cheaper to run than the old HP 6960. Hewlett Packard seem to have jacked up their cartridge prices to an unaffordable level of over ¬£100 per set of 4 (of the XL cartridges) unless you sign up for a 'continuous automatic (and uncontrollable) cartridge supply contract' with HP (which I don't want to do).",1
Fairly quiet in the shop considering how close it was to Christmas! The assistant who served me was cheerful and eager to help.

"This is the second PC I've bought from PC Specialist. The first one is now over 8 years old and still working perfectly; just a bit long in the tooth hence the new build. Everything about the PCS website makes the process of building and ordering a machine easy, including lots of information to help choose the right components and automatic compatibility testing to make sure the ones you choose will work together. Once ordered, I was able to make several changes before the PC was built - everything was very easily done through the website. Once in the system, I was kept informed about the progress of my order. PCS are very upfront about the time it takes for every stage an order goes through until final despatch. They have a good arrangement with DPD through whom I was able to change my delivery day. The PC arrived on time, very well packaged and with easy-to-follow setup instructions. All went very smoothly and I was very pleased with the whole process. I highly recommend PC Specialist.",1

"I had a long standing issue on my account with Shell having the correct meter details. The whole experience was very unsatisfactory, and I lodged telephone complaints and finally written complaints. That experience does not get a 5* review at all...

...but eventually my complaint landed on the desk of ""Andrej M"" in complaints dept, and my review is about that experience, because the trajectory completely turned around after he got involved on my complaint.

I started to receive regular update on the issue, full and honest acknowledgment of Shell failings, and also a good explanation of how the details on my account got into a mess to begin with. I was no longer being ignored for months by Shell, and someone was actually fixing the problems, who understood what was going on!

During a later resolution telephone call with me, he was very clear, answered all my questions, and I sensed he had really cared to get to the bottom of the issues involved in my complaints. It was such a relief to be dealing with a reasonable person who wants to achieve the best outcome, rather than the dumb automated systems and scripts which plagued the previous 10 months of my issues with Shell.",1

When I phoned Richer Sounds, the person I spoke to explained clearly what my next steps should be to try and get it repaired. He was not only helpful but empathetic. Anyway, as I don‚Äôt drive and amps are quite heavy, appropriate packaging was delivered and my amp was picked up. Just 2 weeks later, I received an email saying it was beyond economical repair, and the original cost could be put towards a new amp of my choosing.

"I needed a new computer for work, as I work in the animation industry. I put something together on the custom page, which was easy to use. It was also really handy to be able to go into the live chat to ask if what I'd done was okay. They were so friendly and nice! And so helpful with my computer and put in things they thought were better for what I needed.

It was so simple for me to go back to the quote we'd made and purchase the computer. There were loads of updates while it was being made which was so nice and gave me peace of mind.

They were also really helpful and patient with me when I was an idiot and downloaded the wrong file for my invoice, and freaked out! (I'm a bit of a silly sauage).

All in all an amazing experience and I would definitely go with them again and recommended to a friend!

The computer itself (nicknamed beefy boi for its power) works perfectly and was quick and easy to set up.",1

"Bought a laptop from them in 2014 which I still use daily, not had an issue. Wanted to post as there are a lot of 1 star reviews stating that they're quoted a lot of money for replacement parts. This is wholly down to the buyer, it's completely in your own choice as to which warranty you purchase, don't cheap out, failures often occur, there's no way of knowing if your unit is 100% bullet proof or not. Protect your investment and buy a decent warranty. Also, you note most of the 1 star reviewers have only left 1 review, tends to be fakes. And no, PCS can't delete reviews, only Trustpilot can if they're reported to be fake or offensive.",1

"I had exactly the same problem with buying a 3 month package and then being surreptitiously charged for a monthly fee after that without being notified ..I had many many advertising emails from them which went straight in the spam bin as I was of the understanding I had paid for a service and that was it !! In future I am now checking my bank account online every month and in future when I sign up with any of these multinational conglomerate companies who are not actually providing a service to the community but conning consumers out of hard earned cash to feed their ever more greedy shareholders and CEOs ..I will make sure I have a screen shot of everything to do with the contract kept in a folder available for reference next time.. but not with nowtv.. are they all the same?..
A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT may be the way to go to tackle Nowtv's outrageous fraudulent activities as it seems my case is just the tip of the iceberg!! I will try to report this company to the OMBUDSMAN",0

"Shamble‚Äôs of a company can only complain by phone or post. Try to get them to answer the phone, what a joke of a company raise a fault then go to track it and there is no record of the fault. Service is getting worse and that‚Äôs hard to believe as it‚Äôs been terrible for years

"Wanted to return an item within my 30 days limit as the item wasn't good enough for the money I paid for it.

They have scheduled me a delivery date for my parcel to be collected which did not happen as their drivers they are partnered with are truly disgusting and refuse to do their job.

Called them and asked why has the driver not come to collect it and Ebuyer staff just booked me another collection date and to my surprise (Not) the driver hasn't showed up :).

So, my package is still waiting and no one is doing anything. If you do buy something from E-buyer just think twice as the prpbability of you returning it are very low since they work with Yodel and Parcelforce which are - (Among the worst companies for deliveries).

Go for Amazon instead!",0

Oh and the refund will take 5 days. No apology nothing. Shocking",0
"Seriously the worst company of all time. A nightmare to cancel your contract if you leave the premises. We moved out over 4 months ago and they are still billing me. I've spent hours, no, days and weeks, on the phone, on chat, emailing but with no success. So cancelled my direct debit and then got emails from their credit recovery department saying they'd cut off the supply AND my credit rating would be affected and I would still have to pay the bill. The ironical thing is new people who are now using the broadband in the building have done everything they can to change over the account to their name but also without success. If anyone reading this (apart from Vodafone who will simply direct me to their site to email them) can suggest something I can do to get rid of this company then please let me know in a review. My contract runs till April and all we need is a change of account name as we are NO LONGER IN THE BUILDING and haven't been since September!! I feel truly sorry for anyone who works for Vodafone...a complete embarrassment of a company.",0
"Absolutely hopeless. I have an 'at risk' child and need to keep medicine chilled in the fridge. At the beginning of August our year-old Hotpoint Fridge Freezer packed up (the fridge stopped cooling) and after almost 1-hour on the phone, had an engineer appointment booked for Monday 10th August. The engineer turned up and said that we needed to defrost the fridge (strange, as there was absolutely no ice build up), and that after defrosting it, it should then work properly). Guess what, there was no water when we defrosted it (as there was no ice build up) and it still didn't work. On the phone again for another hour, and another engineer turned up today. He said a 'switch was stuck' and also changed the fan. Told us to leave it for 2-hours and that the fridge would then work properly. After 2-hours, still not working and fridge temperature at 20-degrees C.
Now have to wait another week for another engineer. Food has gone off. Milk goes off within a day. Medicine is not cool enough. What a bunch of amateurs!",0

Asked to call me as wanted to know why taking so long. Said they don‚Äôt offer phone calls (awful customer service already) have followed up constantly via email but nothing ‚Ä¶. Every now and again they just tell me they are investigating. Call Royal Mail today (now over 2 weeks!) and they have advised me music magpie havnt even CONTACTED them! So I‚Äôve been lied too. I‚Äôm out of pocket ¬£200 and not one person has apologised or even got back to me. Quick to take your money but won‚Äôt reply when anything goes wrong. How they are trading I will never know. Will start small claims court and CAB proceedings as this is utterly disgraceful. We are all busy music magpie - no excuse to ignore customers and lie to them!!

"Left Vodafone around a year ago due to poor customer service & joined virgin. Decided to leave virgin, (they made Vodafone look decent) & thought I'd give Vodafone another go - due to where I live I'm pretty limited to companies that use the Vodafone network. Chose my plan online & tried to buy but as Vodafone still recognised my number had problems logging in. Started a 'live chat' & after 3 hours the only progress was a credit check that had been completed by Vodafone using an incorrect address, (that I'd told the advisor was incorrect). This led to failing the credit check even though I have a 980 score & being told that Vodafone would only consider my application after 90 days. Trying to then speak with an advisor about whether the incorrect check would leave a black mark against my credit score took a further 2 hours the following day. At least Vodafone re enforced the reasons why I left originally. The customer service is laughable - passed around endlessly to different advisors who all have zero ability or knowledge to be able to advise.",0

"I had talk talk for 5 years, Internet was never great, used to cut out around midnight. But when it came to leaving is why they get 1 star, appalling service and company rules, I'm not in a contract but they're telling me I need yo give 30 days notice, which is a tactic to get another payment out of me for nothing. Transfered 8 times, hung up on all while being very patient and polite as I know the difficulties of working in customer service, but talktalk have none of it. Never again.",0
"I started to have a technical fault with my broadband which highlighted to me that my speeds were low. BT then informed me of the maximum speed where I live being 29mbps. This meant I was mis sold an over priced package with benefits/speed that were physically unattainable. They knew and did nothing to correct my tarrif or payments. I was paying more than double the going rate.
I switched to sky and get the exact same service and speeds as I was before (on a more appropriate contract to reflect what is actually attainable in my area) for less than ¬£30 per month saving me lots of month. Customer services were not very helpful, and even refused to let me make a complaint and once a complaint was opened it was immediately closed the next day. Awful. Good riddance and now I‚Äôm financially better off! Change your provider now! Don‚Äôt use them!",0
"If you want a telecommunications company with utter contempt for its customers look no further than BT. Even their ""Executive Customer Executive Team"" couldn't, at best, care less, and at the worse will fob you off with false platitudes and promises.
And don't even expect this company to be able to manage simple requests for recordings of your calls in order to escalate the case to the Information Commissioners Office and provide evidence to the Alternative Dispute Resolution. BT will ignore your written requests and verbally fob you off. Even emails to their data controller seem to fall on death ears. So, what conclusion should I draw from this? Well, either BT are incapable of dealing with situation or they wish to hide their eight month catalogue of errors, shortcomings and ineptitude from scrutiny. My hunch is a combination of the two!",0
Worst customer service I‚Äôve ever received.,0
"To start, their internet connection is incredibly poor. You can be in the middle of a busy city and be barely able to connect to the internet. Secondly, I am currently on holiday in Spain and received a phone call which I did not answer. Somehow this triggered their international data roaming, meaning I spent ¬£2 for the privilege of not answering a random phone call. It just feels like they're making money off of every little thing while providing a poor service. I'm not interested in sticking with them any longer than I have to.",0
"My washing machine is broken just phone up team knowhow spoke to a lovely lady on the phone, but and it is a big but I now have to wait 13 days for an engineer to come and look at it, what kind of service is that, I pay to have it mended so why am I waiting soo longer for them to come out?",0
"Used to be good when they had the '1/2/3' plan. Then their customer services went offshore & they hiked their PAYG prices - it's now 35p a minute! That would be bad enough, but trying to leave them is a pain & shows what a shambles they've become - requesting a PAC code took 3 failed text attempts, 2 failed online attempts & 3 calls to customer services. Try 1p/RWG/anyone else before you try using Three!!!

Update - Thanks for the reply Three, you've now earnt that 1*!
I was referring more to the awful service, than the price increase.
If you can't explain why it takes you 8 attempts to get a PAC code, i suspect you won't be able to explain why you're not in business in Three years.",0

He didn‚Äôt like that I was right and he has brought my sexuality into this for what reason I don‚Äôt know why but he should be sacked immediately.

"We had done a search for broadband and done nothing apart from put postcode and address details in then this evening a 'sales rep' turned up at our door. This is verging on breach of data protection as they identified us and specifically came to our door without permission (not any others nearby). I don't like door to door sales at the best of times but using data like this and just turning up being pushy is creepy and wrong.

In response to Virgin Media's response. Putting the address information into your website does not say that it will result in being contacted by someone knocking on your door. What it actually says is (quoted from your website 'By entering your number, you consent to us calling or texting you abut this search. We won't use it for anything else. Privacy Policy') I did not consent to being contacted and in fact I did not even put our number in because I did not want to be contacted in relation to the search at all. I also checked your privacy policy and this also didn't mention about having your address details used to have a sales rep knock at your door. As you have drawn attention to this I am now considering making a complaint to the ICO about misuse of data, especially as you appear to believe that this wasn't an error and is perfectly within your rights, which it was not.",0

I told him that BT had this problem and moved it to the 1st floor
He replied thats old stuff ours is super doper stuff
And I think he just wasn't interested
Any the fact of the matter was he didn't what to do it .this would have involved about 5 mtrs of cable
So the upshot is it don‚Äôt work at all outside the office on the ground floor
Spent the whole yesterday speaking to agents one even had chickens running around his house with loads of kids screaming in the background his English was at least poor in fact I think I new more Indian than he did English
Spent severn hours all told only to be told I need a upgrade really after all the sales hype of how well it works all over your house

Do not, ever, shop with them. Go with the providers.",0
"I didn't get my delivery because apparently the driver couldn't find my house. When I tried to give direction, he just ended the chat.
Tried to chat with customer service who imsisted in the 1st sentence that they will not issue refund because the driver tried to call me. Well he DID NOT call.
Just unacceptable.

"Ordered in plenty of time for Christmas, paid for 1st class delivery just to be doubly sure and was told the item would be delivered on 16th December‚Ä¶loads time before Christmas (or so I thought). Snapfish didn‚Äôt bother to create my order in time and it is now stating delivery on 28th - 29th December. This isn‚Äôt to do with the postal strikes, Snapfish have sent my item late! I have recieved delivery of post from other companies already (ordered at the same time). This review isn‚Äôt a reflection on the item itself, just the service. I haven‚Äôt recieved the item so have no idea on quality, I had ordered it for a Christmas present and Snapfish failed me.

Terrible customer service. I first contacted GHD in the first week in Jan and finally got a response 2 weeks later to return my brand new broken GHD Max product. I sent it tracked delivery which arrived with them on 21st Jan. I was told on 24th Jan that they were sending me a new one but still no product and no proactive customer service. They are apparently now in a blackout so nothing will be processed for 5-7 days (even though this was supposedly done 2 weeks ago and I can go and buy a new set from their website). This was a Christmas present for my daughter that she has used twice,0
"I applied for virgin media broadband in December, but decided to cancel the following day, after seeing reviews about their customer service. I was transferred to 3 different departments when I called and cancelling was far more difficult than it should have been!! I then noticed that my credit score had gone down 47 points, as virgin media had done a hard credit search on me! A hard search is completely unnecessary & they definitely aren't transparent in what they do, as you would assume that it would be a soft search (they don't specify that it's a hard search). I emailed them to ask for this to be removed from my file, as I cancelled within 24 hours of setting it up, but they are refusing & just send a prewritten template email in response. Please be aware that your credit score will be impacted if you decide to get virgin media broadband & stay clear!!",0
"I didn't receive my bill as usual on 8/1/23 so on the 9th I waited in a 30+ online qu√© to be told by an advisor that customers due to receive their bill at the beginning on the month won't now receive them until the following month due to their software issues. WHY DIDN'T SHELL INFORM ITS CUSTOMERS OF THIS?

The advisor told me I could however request a manual bill in a few days tho. So today (admittedly I didn't wait a few days) I went online again and waited in a 40+ qu√© for a different advisor to tell me that I was mis-informed and could not get a manual bill until 28 days after 6/1/23 (2 days before my Feb bill!)

Collecting card details and lying that they will send a sim card with unlimited calls and SMSs for 6.99. They only want to take the card details and get money from the card.

Sim card has never been sent but two direct debits have been settled. No one picks up the calls when you try to reach them or answer your emails. Do not trust this company!

Pay monthly insurance and have done for some time. Problem started with screen and losing vision on the screen. large black and purple mark creeping over screen contacted Team Know-How Car Phone Warehouse on four occasions. no one logged any details.One man said he had dealt with it but he had not. Was passed to one staff member after another across several phone calls expected to wait unreasonable lengths of time. Was not given reason for the long waits or why they could not address the problem. No one could agree whether I could receive a service despite paying monthly insurance. Was promised communication would be returned but no one returned or offered any help. All i received was an invite to provide a review. Still cant use phone despite needing it for a sick family member. One of the worst experiences ive had so far.,0

Don't EVER buy anything from the Carphone(y) Warehouse. Absolutely terrible company.
I ordered a sim-free phone online in OCTOBER, which I cancelled by not accepting the order, but I STILL haven't had a refund. I have spent approx 8 hours calling them (they haven't called me once, after telling me that Senior Management would be addressing my issue on 4 separate occasions).
Apparently, the phone was delivered (despite me rejecting the delivery a few days earlier) and signed for by me. I was in SPAIN when they claimed it was delivered.
I was told after approx 10 seperate calls that I would get a refund if I went in-store. My Wife went in and the manager said that is not even something the store are supposed to do, but he'd do it for us due to the SHOCKING service I have had. This will take up to 7 days he said. Guess what...this was 15 days ago.
Christmas or not, this not an excuse.
If you are thinking of getting a new phone, I implore to buy from someone else. Anyone else.",0
"I made a terrible mistake. Was with TalkTalk and they put the price up as soon as my contract period ended so I thought I'd switch.

Went with BT and I've regretted it every single day since. They're cheap enough but that's because their service is genuinely not fit for purpose. My connection drops out around 50 times a day at a minimum, for 2-3 mins each time, sometimes longer. Often these cut outs happen back to back for 2-3 hours so the Internet is completely unusable. Not so much a problem when I'm using my phone as it switches to mobile data but I work from home and need to be consistently connected through my laptop through the day. Also its making my kids lives a misery. My daughter spent 7 hours working on a piece of coursework the other day but the connection dropped out when she tried to submit it to her tutor so it didn't send and she missed her deadline.

I am looking into ways to legally end my contract as they've not provided the service I'm paying for. I've been advised to take screen shots every time the Internet drops, showing date and time, I've been doing this since yesterday and so far I have 64 screenshots showing that my phone has switched to mobile data because of poor or no connection with BT

I would contact them about it but they make it so difficult to talk to a human, and when you do finally get a human they don't understand English and just keep repeating themselves and don't actually help (I've had to contact them about different issues 3 times since signing up, never had to contact TalkTalk once) so I'm taking legal action instead of wasting my time

Please avoid them!",0
"If I could give less than 1 star I would. I recently paid for a nice new iPhone 12. On the website the information said collection available within 24hrs. My phone had broken so it was important to me to get the phone ASAP. As soon as I'd paid the information change. It was now 48hrs. I waited longer than the 48hrs before going to attempt to collect my phone. I was left waiting outside for over 20 minutes while they tried to find my order. It wasn't available at that time. So I purchased the exact same product from argos. It was available to collect immediately. So I collected.
I phoned carphone warehouse the following day to cancel the order. I was told 3-5 days for the refund. A week later still no funds in my account.
I then phoned again and was told it had been escalated with the banking team and would definitely be in my account. Now another 6 days have gone by and I'm still no further forward with my refund. The money goes into their account immediately. It should be the same when issuing a refund. I've been waiting for over 2 weeks now for ¬£866. PLEASE AVOID CARPHONE WAREHOUSE.

On the day of the appointment I contacted talk talk to tell them we had been in all day waiting for the engineer . He asked the usual questions, name, postcode..only to be told his details don't match what I'd given him...I know where I live! So I can only assume the engineer went to the wrong address. Tried to sort this out on the phone today for an hour to be told I have to write an email to receive a photo of my front door taken by engineer on the day of missed appointment.

I called again and after speaking to another 3 different people I got nowhere, it showed a complaint was logged and closed off and I don't know how it was closed as nothing was resolved or maybe this is how BT report into ofcom to help with their stats. I was with Virgin for 9 years prior and whilst I had minor issues with them and the occasional poor service they are excellent compared to what I have experienced after being with BT for 6 months. I wouldn't recommend BT as you pay significantly more than the Competition just for the name and no better service. I don't generally use trust pilot or social media but feel people need to be aware and you can form your own opinion. If you like being on hold for hours and paying 20% to 50% more than virgin or Sky based on their current offers BT is definitely the company for you. I will not use them again once the contract expires. Please don't reply with your standard contact us on twitter or Facebook which appears to be the reply message to all as I don't use them.",0
"Well what can you say about Virgin Media... well apparently a lot.. their customer service are beyond a joke, reported the cable had been cut at the footpath by National Grid... so we have NO services at all in the property.

Now apparently Virgin Media have NO engineer's that work on Call Out or Out of Hours so now have NO services in our house for another 4 days...
National Grid have said tell Virgin we are at fault and will pay for repairs ASAP... Can't do that it's not in the script...
Virgin Media you have probably the worst customer services of any provider and in reality couldn't care less about Customer's.

Here's a tip for the CEO of Virgin Media UK... try and get some customer service from your own Customer Service Team... firstly having to navigate every option not to talk to you on the phone and when you get through to step through the useless scripted scripts and then tell everyone you have a Great Customer Service..

Nice idea, doesn‚Äôt work, and they couldn‚Äôt make it work to save its own poor quality within. They won‚Äôt refund, they won‚Äôt explain the basics of exactly where they supposedly left my food (cannot provide photo evidence), but they will blindly defend their own incompetence without providing any reasonable responses as to what happened.

My latest contract incl iPhone purchase ends this week. Asked for PAC, spent half an hour with an agent desperately trying to get me to stay. Promised a PAC but haven't got one.

Wasted hours trying to contact them then told they need to check for fraudulent (but they confirm not on my part!!!) activity.

It's nonsense, clearly delaying. Always been paid direct debit. Same charge every month. Also isn't it curious that this security check has suddenly arisen? Surely if they had concerns about security issues they wouldn't have waited until I decided to leave?

This is despite multiple calls to them, and many promises of call backs which never happened. The customer services team have no ability to give you updates on engineer visits or escalate anything, probably because they're inundated with calls from customers who are also calling to chase or complain.

"I ordered food as a treat for my birthday. I updated my address to correct 1. I got missed call from driver, I called back I left voice mail. I then got a message driver was outside. I went out he was not outside. I phoned driver and left voicemail telling him precisely my address and put address in a message. I then got message saying food was outside. My food was left at wrong address. Someone got a free meal due to incompetency of driver and being undilligent. I phoned proprietor he told me food was given to driver. He rang driver and it went straight to voicemail. Proprietor told me deliveroo drivers are known for taking drinks from orders and eating peoples food. He advised me to use Uber eats, i did food delivered smoothly. Deliveroo are thieves. I contacted deliveroo asking for a refund. I won't be using Deliveroo again.


Today I received an email from Aaron at deliveroo, saying they had looked into my case. The outcome being after the driver had phoned me and messaged me on the app. He couldn't contact me and left the food outside my house. So i wouldn't be getting a refund. I phoned deliveroo customer services on 203 699 9977. I explained what happened, the man was polite and apologetic. He assured me the money will be refunded back into my account.

"Miss-sold a service and lied to on entering a contract, service failed constantly as along with many providers i had used after moving in to my new home which turned out to be due to corroding aluminium cables under my street in need of replacement that short out in the damp or wet and make a reliable internet and phone service impossible. These jokers blamed myself for the failures and although three independent engineers confirmed the issues i am still liable for termination fees after i had to cancel and have Virgin media installed. BT then passed the debt on to three different agencies who all dropped the charges along with the case after seeing my evidence that BT had actually closed the account, and had paid me a refund for overcharges at the time of termination. They are not part of CISAS, they do not exist in OFCOM, and you have to use their own complaints procedure along with their own ombudsman who are funded by BT anyway and are bias, they are also being protected by Trustpilot who refuse to publish certain parts of my experience even though evidence is available. I now have a negative mark on my credit file that i still fight to have removed because of this disgusting incompetent company and this has been ongoing since June 2018, i guess on the positive side, they lose after the mark will automatically be wiped off in just two more years so i will simply be patient but warn others not to make the same mistake as i did and trust them.",0

I have just complained to NOW TV to say I have been charged despite cancelling, and they now claim the cancellation was incomplete.

I couldn't physically discuss it with anyone to stop the price hike. They deceive you to get money out of you and lead you to believe no further costs will be collected.
A good percentage of agents speak English as an 2nd/additional language so at times the conversation gets difficult to understand from both parties, it gets lost in translation leading to getting no further from when the conversation started. No fault of the agent if English is not their 1st language but on behalf of the company it's not good customer service.",0

They are very sharp with the money. I joined for one month to watch a sporting activity, and got charged for two months due to their opaque fee structure.
Foolishly I left my credit card details on their system, and they subsequently charged me for a cinema membership plus boost, I certainly have no recollection ordering. They never provided proof of this despite my asking for details.

To clinch the deal she told me the was a 120 pound cashback deal with Huawei if I got the phone today 24th April as the deal runs out on the 26th April so I acceped the deal only to find out on Huawei website that the deal finished on 26th of march. I have tried to contact carphone warehouse on numerous times over my 14 day cooling off period, to be told on the phone not my department and the number on their website is closed due to corovirus.

"Blind leading blind. I purchased a TV with a care and repair plan In 2020. The unit has had 4 replacement screens since this time with the latest ""repair"" taking 3 weeks and being delivered on the 18/09. Even though the delivery note states ""full diagnostic and quality assurance"" checks completed there was no audio and therefore I have ow been without a working TV for a month. Due to the volume of repairs I requested a write off in store on 19/09 and was provided a reference number , heard nothing. Went back to store and was told this was non existent and the request was sent in again , providing a similar 7 digit number. Called care and repair today to ensure they have received this before completing any further repairs to be also told this was not added. Lady on the phone again told me (recorded call) that It had now been noted on the job sheet for a write off and I was eligible for a replacement due to 5 failures in the product (could have requested a replacement the third time). When I asked to complain I was told managers were completing other duties and was basically fobbed off. They have a few days to complete the request in line with my signed agreement or I will be looking to obtain a final response from the company ready to launch a complaint with the ombudsman officially.

"Recently renewed my mobile contract, wish I hadn't! The 5g signal is much worse than my old 4g?

Currently waiting on hold to speak to someone, for over an hour now!

***update
Full story
A month ago I phoned to upgrade to the latest high speed broadband provided by Vodafone with cityfibre. I was told as an existing customer it would be ¬£45 per month, I disputed this cost as new customers could get it cheaper, I was basically told tough, its 45. So I gave my notice and organised installation of the high speed service for ¬£30 a month.
The next day I get an email from Vodafone offering the service for 30! Someone's taking the mickey!
Anyway, installation was due on the 22nd of December. Less than 48 hours prior, after organising a day off work, I receive an email and text cancelling the install and rescheduling for the 30 January 2023!!!
I spend 1 hour 35 minutes on the phone to try and sort the situation, the end result is cancelling the high speed install wasting a day off work and now wasting time to reject delivery of the new router!!
Obviously I now need to keep the service I'm currently on until I can make a break from these jokers, spent god knows how long on social media and live chat to no avail and now after another 15 minutes on the phone I need to phone back later because the systems are down!
Who is going to compensate me for my time?!",0
"I thought I have seen bad customer service but Virgin Media is awfully and dangerously worst. They take it to another level. I have been with Virgin Media for over 10 years and I have seen countless of
frightening experiences. You will ask why are you still with them, I was enduring because the broadband seems good. So I endure but not no more. Over these years I have written more than 5 complaints and 1 is currently with the Ombudsman. I feel headache after every conversation with them.

I will only give 2 reasons here:

I rent my house furnished and one tenant decided to subscribe to Netflix with my virgin account in the house. When the tenant left, Virgin refuse to remove the Netflix subscription so I was paying for another person's subscription for close to a year. All through these months I was asked to go to Netflix to terminate the account. Now the matter is with the Ombudsman and they are now offering me less than half of the refund.

Because of these poor treatments, I decided to close one of my accounts as I am fed up with their poor and awfully customer service. My account was terminated without telling me and when I challenged it, it was reinstated after about 5 days. They wanted me to pay for those days my account was terminated and offline. I challenged them again and in the process of looking into it, my credit file was marked with missed payment. I called them nobody can give me any info. I decided, to pay the money yet they still marked my file with another missed payment the next week.

Virgin media may have a good product but the people are terrible. These are some of the few things I have noticed:
The call handler agents are poorly poorly trained
They won't call you back when they say I will call you back
Nobody takes responsibility
They are in a hurry to pass you to the next agent
The complaint process is rubbish
Forget it, you can't speak to any other person/Manager other than that poor call handler agent
Be prepared to wait for minutes and when someone answers be prepared to be on the phone for at least an hour as you will be tossed from one agent to another
They don't communicate with other departments.

Good luck, if you are going to join Virgin Media and well done for enduring if you are still with them. As for me, I am gradually leaving them. I only have 2 contracts left and at the end of them I will leave them",0

I asked him if he knew about GDPR and he said he didn't care about GDPR nor me as a customer, he cared about himself only!

I traded in my iPad and placed an order on the same day, so that I wouldn‚Äôt be without an iPad for long. Because of their price changes, I could end up getting less than I should have done for the iPad I traded in and paying more for the one I want to replace it with.

Also, still no reassurance from them that I won‚Äôt be out-of-pocket as a result of all this. As others have said, it‚Äôs all about them and their inflexible internal procedures.

They‚Äôve said they‚Äôll get back to me. If the situation picks up, I‚Äôll happily write something more positive, in a spirit of fairness. In the past, I‚Äôve had a good experience with them, which is why I‚Äôm so disappointed this time.",0

"I am absolutely disgusted with the lack of competent service offered by Team Knowhow and by my inability to even contact anyone to report yet another failing of a machine that has been serviced/repaired time and time again. I have had 'engineers' out for this same machine twice in February, both times with assurances that there would be no more problems. In April I wrote to complain that not only had they not repaired the machine, they had not replumbed it in (not a huge issue - I don't mind emptying the tank), they had torn my new linoleum floor with careless handling and, what's more, the machine was still not drying correctly. Due to Corona Virus they couldn't come out again but no-one bothered to reply to my letter. In July I managed to get a booking and they came out again on the 10th September - again confirming all was working. On the first run I realised that was not the case and still they had not plumbed it back in. I managed to contact them after a 1hr wait on the phone, and they scheduled another 'engineer' who arrived on the 17th September and replaced the pump and confirmed, again, that he had reconnected the outlet pipe and tested the machine. Still the machine was not drying and the water seemed to have nowhere to go. It was clearly not plumbed in as, initially there was some water in the tank to be emptied but now it has tripped the circuit. An electrician replaced the fuse on the wall and we tried it again, and again it tripped. This time immediately.

the claims pcworld/currys make they will replace any object if it is not working properly or damaged is FALSE. they never replace. i would never buy any products or recommend other to buy products from this retailer, absolutely frustrating, and disgusting..
i must have sent my laptop to your centre atleast 30 times and been paying 5¬£ every month for last couple of years it is disgusting i get treated this badly when i request to write off absolutely filthy and disgusting customer services and false claims on their website. never buy anything from you guys again.. filthy scum baags at it best.",0

So this company is fraudulent. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. this company is not FCA registered and is not legally part of shop direct or Littlewoods check company's house www.companieshouse the company will lie to you not tell you where your money is going and charge extortionate prices for poor quality goods. The company will not listen to customer complaints but will hold your credit score at ransom for a lot more money. Safer to avoid and go to a reputable company. The highest complaint you can make will go to a customer excellence team who are given 8 weeks training. They are not managers and can not help you you can also not make a complaint any further as the Financial ombudsman service can not help due to their in registered status. They will ignore consumer rights acts as part of UK law and still destroy your credit score even if you have reasonable cause to hold payments due to complaints. if you hold a good credit score AVOID,0
"I had ordered an iPhone 12 off the Carphone Warehouse website with an ID Mobile contract and received emails of a confirmation order, and credit check confirmation and that I would receive the parcel with their FREE NEXT DAY service which was a load of rubbish as nothing turned up. I had to contact the courier myself to find out an update to my 'Next Day' delivery. DPD said it would be delivered the next day after that and the day comes and no delivery.

DPD tracking shows the expensive parcel in transit to a depot for the last 5 days, it is only because I called to find out what is going on.

Carphone Warehouse speak to DPD however an investigation is launched that lasts 5 days. After that DPD says the package is lost (More like stolen).

First time ordering online through the Carphone Warehouse website and it's been horrible and the fact my network is owned by Carphone Warehouse makes me not look forward to the next 2 years with a horrible company.

It has completely incovienced me with making sure I was in for the delivery, unable to cancel my previous contract until I receive the phone causing me to be double charged with my existing contract and the new one etc. Not only that but when I did call up on the 5th day of investigation, they answered very quickly however was told their systems were down and could only answer queries at the time and could not check anyones account. Meaning I had to wait even longer into the day.

The business has a duty of care with all customer products, I do not expect to place an order of high value and for it to go missing on the first day of being delivered. Carphone Warehouse have to maintain responsability as it is purchased through them even if it is with the courier, DPD. To me that shows they handle customer goods with no care at all and I have had to keep chasing up and finding out what is going on off my own back.

I pursued for some sort of compensation and considering I paid ¬£60 up front with a case and now pay over ¬£40 a month for the next 2 years, the best they could offer me was ¬£20 back to me. Nearly 10 days later getting the phone, originally waiting in for delivery, systems being down, having to wait for an investigation, losing the parcel in the first place, I feel ¬£20 isn't near enough for the inconvenience caused and trust lost.

I am very tempted to cancel the whole thing, I would honestly and truely really really not recommend ordering online and make sure they have stock in store. The customer journey has been horrifying from the beginning, I will most definitely never order from Carphone Warehouse again as this was my first and certainly last time.",0

"*DO NOT BUY* Lloyd Pascal Dark Chevron 6 Drawer Chest - Dark Wood- bought 2 at ¬£225 each. Lots of damage to visible surfaces on first set- was offered ¬£50 refund.

Asked for more than ¬£50 refund as worse to be told ¬£50 is maximum. It was then suggested that I could disassemble them (each set took 4+ hours to build!) and return to store for replacement- as if I would trust another set to be damage free as well as waste more hours taking apart and rebuilding!

"They are advertising/selling strimmer blades on Amazon so as I needed them to cut my grass I naturally ordered them thinking they would be good quality from a known brand. When I ordered I naturally assumed it would be a pack of 20 as that's the going number for them in the retail package, I got one single blade!

I thought it was a joke or that the package is damaged but no! Who in their right mind would pay ¬£4 for a single blade that lasts 5 minuities at most, its it same price as a retail pack of 20 everywhere else!

I would think that this is a mistake but I had an instant refund from Amazon so this leads me to believe that this is a dubious practice at best.

Disgusting, wont be using this company again.

"I sent my laptop in for repair as it was not charging. At the shop I was told the charging port probably needed changing. There is a small crack on the case next to the charging port from putting the cord in causing the break.

I have had 4 messages sating they where fixing it. Sunday morning 8:30 I was rang by a member of staff I will be complaining about telling me I am not covered for this in my ¬£150 insurance policy. I did not understand this as it was damaged placing in the product I have paid for. I was then talked to like rubbish and told it would cost ¬£200 to replace. I asked why as this repair in shop is ¬£80 max.

The staff member broke broke the cost of repair, somethings that was not needed at all for the repair, showing it was a cash grab and my insurance was explained as worthless. The customer service was disgusting, the cash grab shameful and the product inferior. Moreover, the insurance is worth as much as dust in the wind.

Update 27/9/21
Below you can see an attempt to look like perceived support from Teamknowhow. They did not fulfill my insurance, currys staff have seen my product and said it is shameful and apologied profusely for this inadequate service and a grab of my a large sum of my earned money for no service. This activity is just a con, and if I acted this way in my job in would be struck off and done for inadequate practice.

22/10/21
The company told me to contest it, I have statements from Currys staff, they where so embarrassed they gave me money off another product. Also an independent It technician for an established company saying Teamknow have been negligent and they should be fixing it under my guarantee.

I called them again on day 5 only to be told that my immaculate, fully working, non scratched phone was not in working condition and they could offer me ¬£30.

"I ordered a part for my broken cooker on 2 October 2022 from ESPARES.

I was told it would be up to two weeks to get the part.

Two weeks later, the part didn't arrive. I queried this with ESPARES and I was told it would be another two weeks. I queried this as it seemed like an automated response, but was told, 'This is not an automated response, the date has been provided to us by the manufacturer but we do advise it is subject to change and the ETA can be pushed back depending on the Availability of the part. Once the part is in stock we will notify you.'

Two weeks went past, still no part. I then queried with Zanussi, the original cooker maker, whether the part was still made, it wasn't.

ESPARES sent me an email saying that the part was unavailable, and unknown when it would be returned. And I could get a refund by contacting the customer service team.

The email i had received was from their customer services email address. So I sent an email to this address saying to provide me a refund. I was returned a copy of the email they had just sent me about the part not being available and to ask for a refund from customer service.

I then replied again asking for a refund and was again sent the exact same email. I replied to the email a third time to get the refund. And I still got sent the same email. It was obvious at this point that they were blowing past my request for a refund and trying to fob me off.

I went to the website where it say there are numerous ways to get a refund by going to my order and clicking a certain button, (cancel, return.)
I went to my order and none of the buttons were available!

I looked for a contact number, but they don't appear to have a contact number either.

It is very obvious that ESPARES are not offering a 'hassle free refund service' but are in fact making as hard as they can to get a refund from them.

I am putting in a last email and going another way to try and get a refund. If this is not successful, then the next stop is trading standards and the local council.

EDIT 21/11/2022: I have now been sent an email stating that my refund has now been provided.",0

"Team Knowhow's Repair & Support plan promotional literature includes the assertion: ‚ÄúA family home with faulty appliances is an unhappy one. The good news is that with Repair & Support you get unlimited access to our nationwide experts who are standing by to fix your kit.‚Äù

We have been without a working oven for a month after it broke down and unable to cook for our family of four. We have incurred substantial additional costs in having to buy takeaways.

In addition, I have had to take three days off work for engineer appointments, one of which they failed to carry out a repair and the other two they cancelled on the day. To quote their promo, we are a ‚Äúdeeply unhappy family‚Äù to which can be added seriously let down and absolutely furious.

"FURTHER UPDATE FOLLOWING BT RESPONSE

Do not trust this ‚Äúcontact us through twitter and we will sort you out‚Äù nonsense. This is just the standard BT PR lies and distraction kicking in. I had never used twitter so (in desperation) I decided to give this a go. To be fair it does mean that I now have a dedicated route in the Customer Services BUT like ALL the other Customer Services people I have interacted with, they are pleasant, sympathetic and TOTALLY powerless against the ‚ÄòBT Machine‚Äô. The machine which is clearly designed to maximise profit at the expense of Customer Service.
We have now had no service for over SIX WEEKS. Four weeks ago, I asked for the service to be put back to Copper (which had worked previously). I was first told that this had been done, and was then told that it hadn‚Äôt been done, that it was (quote) ‚Äúimpossible to go back to copper‚Äù and the team confirming the reversion should never have sent the confirmation out! A week ago, I was told that they had decided to temporarily put us back to copper (it seems like BT can now do ‚Äúthe impossible‚Äù) and that had been ordered. Four days ago, I was told that they had only ordered the decommissioning of the Full Fibre and, once that had been done, they could THEN order the Copper to be re-instated. Yesterday I was told that the decommissioning of the Full Fibre had failed and they would try again in 48 hours!! So.. BT are so incompetent that they CANNOT EVEN REMOVE A SERVICE THAT ISN‚ÄôT WORKING ANYWAY!!
My Wife and I are both pensioners and, as I have told Customer Services on many occasions, my wife's father is very ill and keeping in touch with him is very important. We have poor mobile signal where we are and with no landline this is proving very challenging and stressful for my wife but.. hey ..as long as BTs idiotic processes need to be followed, who cares ?!
I will be writing to Age UK today to highlight the disdain that BT have for its potentially vulnerable Customers.




ORIGINAL REVIEW

Would give BT 0 stars if it were possible. The worst company I have ever dealt with. We have been without Broadband or Landline now for 6 weeks !! We opted for Full Fibre and it has NEVER worked. I estimate that I have been on the telephone or chat for over 7 hours over the course of the last 6 weeks. We have had 5 engineer visits booked with only 3 actually turning up. All said exactly the same thing ‚Äúnothing wrong with your home setup.. it is an authentication issue .. we will get it escalated‚Äù and NOTHING has happened. I raised a complaint on 1st November and BT (despite knowing that the fault is still there) have closed it three times I keep having to re-open it . I assume this is so they can fiddle their stats with Ofcom ? I have reported this to Ofcom",0

I have a genuine problem and cannot get in touch - the login wouldn't work so i let them reset the p/w and that worked but went to my account and no transactions or anything = the help page is a joke HOW do we get in touch with them? reluctantly if i can't email or get in touch i'll have to cancel through the bank :-(,0
Absolutely awful. Ignore claims then try act like they tried to contact you despite you having proof they didn't. They just fob you off and are really rude over the phone. Honestly take your money elsewhere they just want your money but won't actually give you replacements and if you eventually do it'll be broken (didn't happen to me but several friends replaced broken replacements they refused to replace again.,0
"I have been trying for weeks to reduce my 'package' (removing the landline and the crap TV service). I've spent hours on the phone, being transferred from one person to the next.

"I'll explain the situation.

Last year my then 80 year old mother bought a SIM only contract for her Granddaughter. The one year contract is up on June 13th.
My mother is very ill to the point that she's breathless and has a hard time talking but she still has to take care of her bed bound husband who has late stage dementia.

So last week I phoned three to cancel the contract because if you don't they just keep on taking the payment out much like other companies do. God help it if the person had died before cancelling the contract! Personally I think that a one year contract should last for a year and if that person wants to extend it then they should be able to do it.
Anyway I explained to the foreign agent about the situation. I gave him all the information he needed. So he asked to talk to my mum. I thought all he'd need to ask is for her to give him permission to talk to me!
But no he didn't. Despite me telling him about her ill health and I forcefully said to him keep it brief he then asked my mum the questions that I'd already given him the answers to.

It should be easy enough to cancel a contract that is coming to an end without an OAP worrying that the money and contract would simply roll over.

AS I HAVE SAID THESE COMPANIES NEED TO RETHINK THEIR STRATEGIES. LET A CONTRACT END AND IF ANYONE WANTS TO EXTEND IT THEN LET THOSE PPL PHONE AND DO IT. ALSO ITS SHAMEFUL I HAD TO AWARD ONE STAR TO POST THIS. I TRULY BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A ZERO RATING!",0

( The bill date is on 23rd of each month) However I got another bill charged one months later and after contacting their customer service team again , They explained & promised me will be issued the full refund after the bills has been completed in their system.

They did another line test and said the fault was an external line fault and that it didn‚Äôt need an engineer to visit and this would be sorted by Open reach within the next 24 to 48 hours. After 48 hours still no service, phoned them back and was told that it could take up to 72 hours and that was working hours! So it could be 11 days before it was fixed. Every time I speak to someone you get different information. The good news is that all this has happened within the 14 days cooling off period, just invoked the cooling off period and cancelled the contract.

I rejected the offer, and Mazuma upped the offer to ¬£100 as some of the repair work could now be done in house.

I declined the offer and had the device returned. When I received the device back, I took it and sent it straight to a competitor who paid the full predicted value of ¬£200 straight away.

How can one company say it is worth ¬£45 and another over ¬£200?

Shoddy business practices here I think. Would strongly recommend looking at competitors.",0

"Where do I start...

I have been using Carphone Warehouse for my latest contract, which I have ordered online at the end of 2021 (December time) Ever since then I just had multiple issues. Firstly my phone had to be exchanged 3 TIMES... you read that correctly 3 times in 3 months due to issues with the handset (Google pixel 6 pro and screen issues). Every exchange that I had to make was met with incompetent/lying/misleading staff members who had 0 idea about my order what was happening or what to do next. The 3rd exchange was by far the worst...

After being on the phone in total for 8 hours in 3 days (including holds) I was told on multiple occasions by multiple agents (Annie, John, Rosaline) that my case will be sorted and that I will be able to pick up my new phone in store. I went into 3 separate stores in nottingham to explain the situation, to then be told that in 2 stores they didn't have the phone in stock and the 3rd couldn't do anything as they were locked by the system, no notes were made by the customer service staff.
Then after having to deal with more incompetent staff members in the customer service department, I was bounced around from department to department as nobody knew what to do next or what are the following procedures.

Finally I have managed to get through an agent to got the exchange sorted and told me that Tuesday 3rd May 2022 my phone will be picked up by DPD and then by Friday 6th May my new handset will arrive. Again another lie. My phone was not picked up until Wednesday as the DPD was not informed by Carphone warehouse staff to have a return label (again more incompetence). I then phoned up Carephone warehouse on Friday to see where my order is and was told by 1 agent that there is nothing on the system, rang again (2 hour call) a more competent agent told me that the phone is still being processed and it may take 3 - 5 WORKING DAYS for my new phone to arrive?!!!! Absolute disgrace of a company, especially given the fact that I am paying over ¬£50 per month for my contract and used my phone for around 1 month out of 3. Please avoid this company and I will be seeking compensation for the damages the company has put me through.

More than happy to provide my call logs, and my exchanges and provide more names of agents I have spoken to.

Update 10/05/2022
After calling again to find out where my phone was (Nothing was received via email, had to call myself) - I was informed by another agent that they needed CONFIRMATION from me for the phone to be sent to me??? If I haven't called I would have been waiting forever for the exchange... No confirmation has been received yet, so I will keep updating this review.

Update 30/05/2022
I have asked for a cancellation of my contract and a full refund from the company, I have also sent multiple complaints letters to the business. Nothing received back, no communication... Absolute shambles, please stay away from using this business.

Update 02/06/2022

I was offered meagre ¬£75 for all the troubles, then they raised the offer to ¬£125, which didn't even cover my fuel costs and time wasted outside of work, going through ombudsman services.

AVOID USING CURRYS/CARPHONE WAREHOUSE",0

"My father died last weekend, due to everything I have subsequently had to deal with, I was late paying my bill and was put on restricted service. I tried phoning virgin to be told to go online to pay bill. I am disconnected from internet, so how could I do this. My mobile is on virgin, but mobile data does not stay stable for longer than a minute before losing connection, but I managed to pay. All of this because they have now done away with all phone lines for customer service. The number they gave me 0345 4541111 is no such number and does not work. They remove all options to speak to a person, expecting you to do it all online, but you are disconnected. FFS, Virgin sort your act out, I will be changing supplier as soon as possible.",0

Rang multiple times about this and you‚Äôve never rang me back as always promised Latest phone call to your customer services told me I‚Äôve never rang them and only spoke to technical issues !!!! This is appalling. You‚Äôve ignored my issues and I bet you tell me I‚Äôm out of my 14 days cancellation. You sold this to me not stating you can not turn the tv over if your recording a programme. this is misleading and I will fight to get out this contract. I‚Äôve never spoke to technical issues as it‚Äôs not a technical issue but A MISLEADING sales technique issue. The issue is your 4k box is useless
Told no more multi room tv. Unbelievable!!!!!Upgraded to 4k. Total useless. Unable to pause rewind and if you record you can NOT turn the tv over !! Needs a usb stick to record if it actually does that talk talk tv keeps saying unable to recognise. Customer service total useless !!!was told to go out while recording a program and watch later.oh yes good idea. Defeats the object of recording a programme to watch later. Hours spent on line being told things you can just research on line. Numerous phone calls and no help. Then told no more multi tv in rooms is available. Told my upgrade now wipes out my old box so I can‚Äôt use it. Huge step back in time for technology. Who actually looked at this box. And thought yes great idea. Any chief executives find the box useless ???Do you really think you‚Äôll have a business in two years from now. With customers diverting to other providers. Who have the latest technology!!!

"My talktalk internet failed due to talktalk router breaking. They initially wanted to schedule their own engineer in two weeks time to come out (yes two weeks!).
Then engineer came out and told me needed new router, so had no internet for 6 days.
They compensated me, manager personally phoned and dealt with complaint closure, assured me I would have no charge next month.
Next months bill arrived, and instead of no charge they nearly doubled it. They sneakily added in an Engineer charge of ¬£65. So on one hand, they compensated me for, in their words ‚ÄúPoor quality of service‚Äù, when with the other charging me an engineer call out fee of ¬£65 - that‚Äôs after confirmation that fault at their end!

Wait - it gets worse. After hassle of no service, and then incorrect bill, I‚Äôve now spent nearly 4 hours over two days trying to correct the bill. The online chat is useless, after 2 hours and a manager finally phoned to say bill would be corrected, the bill hasn‚Äôt been updated and manager left no notes.
Now after numerous calls yesterday, where customer billing department are unable to correct bill, and it has to go to technical department who then have to pass to a manager who then has to pass to billing department who then don‚Äôt do anything I end up here and frustrated and wishing talktalk out customer first.",0
"So Tom, I am pleased you find the incompetence of your colleagues disappointing - imagine how I feel being at the end of their continued ineptitude. Having made in excess of 35 calls to virgin media, and being asked by a lady in the Philippines how to spell Mr, and being told by a South African that Richard is an unusual name he has not heard of before you may perhaps understand my reluctance to call again. I now demand a call from someone in authority at Virgin Media. I was told by Wesley at customer service last Saturday that his manager called Conner would phone me within 48 hours. Of course no such call was forthcoming. He also confirmed that an engineer would visit on Tuesday (didnt turn up of course ). Incidentally Wesley was working from home and our chat was interrupted by his mobile phone - Professional? Im sure some one from Virgin Media can trace me through that call. If not Im happy to give my account number over this forum if necessary.
How much longer will this farce go on for?

Just to let you know that after receiving 3 texts saying an engineer would come today one arrived. A very polite guy called Jay. He said he could not carry out the work and spent a long time on his phone to a manager somewhere but had no answers other than ""we recommend customers buy cordless phones"" and ""its unusual these days for customers to have more than one telephone line"" well those two items are news to me. On his advice I phoned 150 and spoke with a man in India - he kept me on the line while he spoke with the engineer and then told me this was a high priority matter now and someone would call me on Monday. So another morning I have taken off work for nothing. Once again will someone in authority from Virgin Media please contact me direct to sort this matter.",0
"I am astonished by the position that Vodafone are taking on Ukrainian refugees in the UK. I am sponsoring a Ukrainian mother and child who are moving into our home.

I am very happy to pay a monthly fee, but simply requested that if I need to end the 18 month contract early in the event of my guest returning to Ukraine then the early termination fee would be waived. The answer was a resounding ‚Äúno, we can‚Äôt do this, you‚Äôll have to pay the termination fee‚Äù. I did challenge them to make sure they understood the implications of this stance but they remained resolute. Let‚Äôs hope the money grabbing Vodafone execs who set these policies don‚Äôt ever find themselves in need‚Ä¶. if we all had this attitude there would be no hope in the world.

"I went via Top Cashback and completed an order for a new Samsung S22 with O2. When it came to pay the upfront cost of ¬£279, the Mobile Phones Direct website wouldn't accept payment because my address on the order didn't match my credit card address. This was because when I put my postcode in their order form it found my full correct address. When you click on the address it put only part of the address, dropping the name of my village. You couldn't manually insert the correct address with the village. I had to ring to complete my order and after 40 minutes it was answered. I then had to go through the order process again, so I was on the phone 70 minutes. THE SALESMAN SAID THAT THE WEBSITE DOES THAT ALL THE TIME BUT THEY CAN OVERIDE THE ADDRESS ERROR. However when my phone arrived it still didn't have my village on the address label. If I had lived on Main Street, there is a Main Street in Hull and my phone could have gone there. It is forcing you to ring up to make the order which is getting sales via Top Cashback, but then not giving people their cashback. In my case I have lost ¬£35 cashback",0

they give me a whole run around and change the story to its nothing to do with openreach its waiting to be closed on there system and will go through in the next 24 hours, after explaining i was told that the last time i dont believe it they wouldnt budge.

You'll need to remember to press the next episode if watching on demand shows as there's no autoplay function and if the episode ends you'll need to go back to the website to launch the next episode. The 'boost' add-on allows for 3 devices. But you can only use one profile so if you and someone else in your household wants to watch the same show the tracking gets messed up.,0

"Was promised a call from the 'retentions manager' on Monday, after waiting 1 and a half hours, I received a call from her colleague saying the manager was not in today and she would call back to.orrow between 12 and 2. Waited from 12 till 2 and no call, she then cleared outside the time agreed and I was unable to get to the phone so missed the call. I then received a text saying if we cannot speak to you, we cannot resolve the issue! No text rearranging another call so I called customer service. This was on Tuesday, they told me the manager would call me between 12 and 2 on Wednesday, so once again sat with my phone for 2 hours at home no call came. I call an engineer and explained what happened and I spoke to Jack. He looked at the notes on my account and agreed no one had called me. At this stage I had wasted 5 and a half hours this week. I explained everything g to Jack saying I was not getting the speed promised to me and talk talk was in breach of contract and I want to leave without any redemption payment to them. Jack spoke to his manager who agreed I could leave without paying a penalty. At last I free of this nightmare, you sit around for hours on end, great if you have nothing better to do. The call centre for this company are not uk based and they treat you like you have done something wrong for complaining they try to make you pay more for a better service, or say you can have an engineer attend and inspect your property at a cost of ¬£50 only refunded if its found nothing us your fault. You do not have to do either of these things if you get broadband at a guaranteed speed and they fail to provide this you can legally cancel your contract without exit fees.
Well, hope this had been helpful, glad this saga has eventually ended.",0

"We've dealt with Carphone Warehouse for some years and have always had good service from the Metrocentre, BUT.... my wife's phone went on the blink so we went to the nearest shop in a PC World outlet. With next to zero advice from the female assistant my wife ended up with a Nokia which was ""recommended"" to her with a point of a finger and the words ""That one"" before said assistant walked off. So, now my wife has this Nokia and she had some troubles, so back to Carphone who have always been great. Not this time, not at the PC World outlet. My wife was working through the problems with a helpful male assistant when the manager interrupted, told my wife to keep quiet when she attempted to explain and continued in an aggressive, sometimes condescending and always arrogant diatribe without ever knowing what the problems were. So, do the logical thing and write to Carphone customer services- did that, still waiting for so much as an acknowledgement nine months later. Guess where I won't go for my next phone.",0
"Would give zero stars if possible.
I ordered one item to be delivered at a specific date, then I chatted them (on their web site) and asked if it's possible to reschedule. They (actually it was a robot) said yes, so I set the new date, so I though that I'm all set. Then I noticed that I don't get the chat transcript on my email (as I expected), so I checked my order on their web site, to see that it appeared as ""cancelled"" ?!?
I chatted them back, then they (a human operator this time) said they can't do anything, and I will be refunded in the next 5 days, if not, I should contact them back... So according to Argus, I should spend my next weeks calling them every 5 working days asking for them to give my money back. In addition, when I asked to speak to a manager, I was told that this is not possible.
I bought from them in the past, but today I've lerned my lesson. Definitely not a customer-oriented company. Will look somewhere else.",0
"I've been with vodafone for at least 2 years. I will not be renewing my broadband, I think vodafone has got to be the worst broadband provider in the world. Every single night at 11pm my broadband goes on and off every couple of minutes for at least 1 hour 30 minutes. And that's after they upgraded my router. I would highly recommend nobody using this company. I'm changing over to Virgin for sure. Vodafone promised me I would get at least 60/70mbps. I'm lucky if I get 10mbps.",0
"Completely inept and unprofessional service, avoid at all costs. The customer service is non existent and there appears to be no commitment in relation to resolving any difficulties.

Me and my partner purchased a iPhone 11 for my son on the 1st May. The wrong colour was delivered. You would think it would be easy to exchange but no. No one picks up the phone which rings then cuts off. When we eventually got through my partner was told to return the phone by courier at our cost. APC Courier reports he has attempted to deliver several times to the warehouse which was reported to Tahirah through the online service but yet again no resolution in sight. No returns label has been sent from Care phone warehouse and the advisor in PC World Romford was just as useless and was unable to print off a label and exchange the phone because apparently the return enquiry is already open. This is an expensive joke!. The unopened phone is still in our possession, boxed and unused which I'm still paying for despite no resolution or means to exchange. Carphone useless....

"No service

My wifi went down and has remained down for the last few days. The service status chekcer says nothing is wrong in the area and suggested i book an engineer....when I called the operator told me there was a fault in my area and they were looking into it. I was due to work from home and missed a very important meeting.
The amount they charge is already ridiculous for what they provide and I am getting fed up with unreliable service and equipment and being patronised on the phone when you do call.
I have been told on the phone there would be no cost to breaking my contract early (although I am sue they will go back on that), so I am in the process of looking to go elsewhere.
My only frustration will be the two hours I will have to spend being transferred from person to person who will try and convince me to stay - they won out last time and I stayed because I was so fed up by the time I was passed to person number 5 to start over the conversation of 'how do you use your TV, phone and broadband.....let me see what I can do for you'

"Having had years of cover plans with Currys/Knowhow I am at my wit's end at the service received on the latest repair and replacement process.

My Indesit Condenser Dryer was faulty and I reported the fault FIVE WEEKS ago. The engineer, arranged through Connect, came out three times before agreeing that the machine was a write off. This is where the service went downhill.

The engineer sent the instruction to write off FOUR times while I was chasing up from my end. Each time I phoned to chase up I was fobbed off that the 'technical team' had it and were about to process the write off so I could get my replacement code to pick up a new machine under the terms of the cover plan.

I phoned on 22/10, was told the code would be with me within 24-48 hours.

I phoned on 29/10, had heard nothing, was told the code would be with me within 24-48 hours.

I phoned on 31/10, had heard nothing, was told the code wodul be with me within 24-48 hours. I said this was not good enough and I wanted assurance that the code would be with me the same day.

The next day came (1/11), still nothing, phoned again, was told the code would be with me within 24-48 hours. AGAIN I explained my frustration that I'd been told this for over a week. AGAIN I was told that they would aim to get me the code the same day.

Guess what? the next day and still nothing. This is today and why I'm writing this review (while on hold to Connect).

This is the worst service I have ever received. I am on the brink of going out and buying a new machine and billing Knowhow for it. It's ridiculous that it has taken over 5 weeks and its still not sorted with no sign of any breakthrough. So disappointing and frustrating, calling them is like Groundhog Day.",0
"Feel tricked into making a pressurised sale. Site had a timer at the top which promised next day delivery, if order was made in certain time.

"UPDATE
Original Complaint :""I ordered a phone and Sim, when the package was delivered there was nothing in it apart from a piece of crudely ripped and folded cardboard! As the package showed no sign it had been resealed it would seem the phone was stolen by a member of carphone warehouse staff. I phoned CW the call centre said they could do nothing as their system was down and refused to contact the warehouse directly. The following day CW closed their call centre so I contacted them via email, that was 6 days ago and I have heard nothing! I am paying for a phone I do not have and I have no way of getting CW to respond. ""
UPDATE
After 2 weeks I was given an email address to contact. While they did answer a few questions they dodged many. They claimed they had investigated and were certain that the phone and SIM were despatched but the only evidence they produced was a photo of someone scanning a barcode.
They were desperate to close the matter and make me go away!
They said they could not ask the courier to investigate which I have since established to be a lie.
I had to ask them to put a stop in the SIM they are still demanding I pay the monthly contact for the SIM but have not replaced it.
They lied again when I asked for the case to be escalated claiming that they had no internal email service!
They have done nothing to help and left me with no phone no SIM and a debt of more than ¬£1000.",0

Easier said than done- hours & hours spent on phone to customer service being put through to department after department & having to explain over & over what the problem is. An absolute joke! Even got told by 1 customer service advisor (after being passed from pillar to post for nearly an hour) that they were finishing work in 7 minutes so we‚Äôre unable to help & I should phone back tomorrow! Steer clear! I wish I had read these comments before joining!",0
"If I could rate them 0 stars, I would.

As a loyal customer for decades (and 11 years at this address), stupidly now paying ¬£115 pm for broadband and TV, I called last week to ask to take advantage of the new BT Home Essentials service for those on low incomes. This would give me broadband and very basic TV for ¬£27 per month.

All of the telecoms companies have committed to providing social tariff rates for people like me who are in receipt of means tested benefits. BT's version of this is *supposed* to be BT Home Essentials, but they won't tell you about this product, even if you ask. They are more likely to sell you a more EXPENSIVE broadband package than you're already on, which was what happened to me on my first call to them last week to discuss how I could access cheaper broadband. Even if you tell BT EXACTLY what you want, ie ""I want BT Home Essentials"", they will say they'll put you on that plan but that too will be a lie. Because they won't do what they say, they'll just fob you off with promises and platitudes. When you call again the following week, to chase up your new service, they will tell you that you are not actually in receipt of Income Support (one of their eligibility criteria) even though you are...even though it is your husband's name that receives it through the National Insurance number, and YOU, as his wife, are deemed to be on Income Support for ALL other legal purposes including claiming Housing Benefit or free school meals for your son!!!...they will bizarrely suggest that YOU should instruct the DWP to change THEIR systems...it would be funny if it wasn't so distressing.

I'm disabled with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, in a wheelchair and I need cheap broadband. I suffer with depression, and extreme anxiety for which I have ongoing counselling. These phone calls to BT have tested my mental resilience to its extreme. I have cried at times which is so embarrassing to admit. My husband is my carer, hence Income Support for Carers (a very specific type of benefit that blows up BTs algorithm) and my husband was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer last February. If we, on our low income and in our vulnerable position, don't qualify for the social tariff then who does???

The attitude of blunt advisers who transferred me through to dead ends, or to others who couldn't help, was particularly challenging as I LOVE repeating myself over...and over...and over...knowing they're never listening to me and that they do not give a damn and that nothing will change because BT simply don't care about providing even a basic level of decent customer service. Special mention must go to Joseph, in the ""loyalty team"", who offered broadband and basic TV at 39.99 per month. But when I asked if I could take some time to think about it, as I don't want a full 24month contract because - to be blunt - I don't know if my husband will die in the next 24 months, Joseph warned me that I would need to decide there and then. He said, ""I can't promise that this offer will be available beyond today"". Talk about duress and bad sales practice.

I have had enough of them. I feel discriminated against as a vulnerable disabled customer about whom they don't just not care. They pay lip service (in meaningless policy statements) to their supposedly accessible services!

I have now raised this matter with OFCOM. I will raise it with relevant Members of Parliament and the media (where necessary) in order to raise awareness of how inaccessible & misrepresented BT's supposedly beneficial social tariff truly is. As a former lawyer myself, if I had ever treated any of my clients in such an obstructive and disdainful manner, I would have rightly expected to go out of business.

It's a shame that BT are too big to fail; they certainly don't deserve to succeed. If you have the opportunity to choose your broadband/TV provider, go ANYWHERE other than BT.",0
"Awful! was a customer since 2013, was never great but for the money I was paying was suitable, the last week they emailed out of the blue to say my sim only deal is no longer available so I can leave or move to these more expensive contracts with the roaming charges, and yearly RPI price increase! but months ago they clearly told me if I didn‚Äôt change contract I wouldn‚Äôt be affected so they just cancelled my plan instead to get me to move!

"I can say I had a laptop until I booked it in for a repair. It was purchased at pc currys with insurance that supposed to cover what ever happens. After it stopped working I took it in to one of their stores for a repair and haven't seen my laptop or heard anything about it. So the 14day promise can be forgotten. The only message I got from them was that they are waiting on parts to be delivered. After 14 days I called to find out when I'm getting a laptop thinking that since the 14 days is up they will have to sort me out with a laptop immediately. It's been 2 weeks after the 14 days promise still no laptop not the old one not a replacement or new one. I have called them 10 times since and its quite funny because the only thing I get from them is ""tomorrow they are looking into it"". I had a care plan that I paid for for nearly 5 years and all I got back was tomorrow and nothing else mind you they have my money that I have paid for insurance all those years and my laptop. Would I recommend team knowhow for consumers absolutely not. All they said to me is tomorrow I'm sorry there is nothing we can do but wait. They had my laptop for so long that the monthly plan I got with them to pay my insurance is been taken for the second time and no laptop for me. Please stay away from their care plan and insurance plans. Nothing but bad negative feed back and now I know why. I could of saved all that money that was payed for the insurance sold my old laptop went to the store and bought me a laptop immediately and it would work out cheaper and faster would have a laptop immediately not having to wait a month.",0
"Placed an order with QMF on the 2nd April for an iPhone 8 plus and was given the usual 7 to 10 days delivery promise.

On the 20th April was given a promise of a further 1 to 4 days.

On the 27th April promised a delivery by the end of that week which didn't happen.

On the 1st May cancelled and requested a refund which I was told would take 14 days to process (why it should take more than a day or two is anyone's guess).

On the 26th May no refund received and a promise of a refund by the 22nd June!

At this point I turned to my credit card provider who processed my claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act and returned my payment.

Absolutely terrible service basically taking my money under the false pretence of proving a product which they could not deliver and then not providing a refund once I had cancelled.

After getting my money back via my credit card company I ordered the same product from a different company at a slightly higher price than that advertised by QMF and received a perfect refurbished iPhone 8 plus within 2 days.

"There is no other word for it, shitshow!! THATS my experience of BT! Fibre ordered, openreach did a great job putting fibre in, all looked great till I realised they had not transferred over my original number which I was clear I wanted to keep after some 30 years. To get it, the order would have to be cancelled which takes a week, by 7th April, then I‚Äôd to phone up on the 8th to reorder and be clear I wanted to keep my number, just as I‚Äôd done the first time???

I went away and thought nope, too risky and I‚Äôm not waiting another 3 wks to find out I‚Äôm in the same position again, I‚Äôll stay with my present provider. The guy I spoke with at BT when I phoned understood and said he‚Äôd send on a Jiffy bag for the router and phones and NOW they‚Äôve sent me an email today, the 8th telling me I‚Äôll need to reinstate my direct debit as my first payment is due on the 13th and I‚Äôll need it in place to make future payments - what the day AFTER the order was cancelled down?? And my account was to be cancelled too?? They are so disorganised it‚Äôs like they are new to the business??? I‚Äôve spoken to at least 4 people who have written notes on the account too supposedly, they are not getting a penny from me, I should be suing them for the stress involved!! GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER BT!!

Mandy from BT
I notice your reply mentions my not being able to keep my number but nothing about an email about me being asked to reinstate my DD as my first payment is due on the 13th April, for what exactly? I was advised I was not liable for the fibre installation, I have kept my number as I have stayed with Sky, whom BT never contacted incidentally as they said they would. I advised BT on 3rd April I had decided I would not be contacting them to ‚Äòstart my order from scratch again‚Äô it is not my fault your system takes a week to ‚Äòcancel the account down‚Äô. I also have received the bag and label yesterday 9th to return the router and digital phones, a clear indication to me all has gone as I was advised?? What does BT expect me to pay for exactly?? No money is going to BT, I can assure you!",0
"A bunch of jokers....

Hard to know where to start.

Sad for shareholders that these jokers are allowed to run their company but at least they have the power to kick them out.

So contract for bt mobile up for review and i also have bt sport appüò≠, which is useless as you cannot cast on to big screen.

I have bt broadband, which is fine.

I change packages and am encouraged to switch my mobile contract to EE, a BT company, so now two bills and payments instead of one.

I get a text on my btmobile re new bt sport sub, note bt mobile, and a pop up invites me to report it as spam.

Bloke on the phone disconnected me before end of transaction and didnt ring back and i have had no communication re switch to EE. I wanted wtitten confirnation of no roaming charges before end of new contract so will now have to ring them again

I thought I would updaye following David's response. The arrogant bt assumption that people are on facebook or twitter is stunning. I shun social media and only review when very good or very bad.

Another BT employee who does not understand the BT Sport basic app which they downgraded last year so you cannot cast it.

Anyway, still no confirmation of the terms of my new contract with EE BUT a Sim card from EE arrived in the post this am. So I rang EE quoting the account number but, no you seriously cannot believe this utterly dysfunctional organisation, there is an account number but EE, who the delivery note says sent the Simcard, cannot access the account as it is still with BT.

"I share a similar issue to many who have put on a review relating to Carphone Warehouse's trade-in service via their website. I recently bought the new iPhone 11 directly from apple to replace my iPhone X. Given that I did not need the old phone, I decided to use the trade-in services at carphone warehouse.

Having been to 2/3 stores, all of which fobbed me off with excuses like their systems were down and even one store telling me that I couldn't trade in a phone for cash unless I was take out another contract, I decided that I would use their online service. As the website states, it couldn't be easier, place the phone in the prepaid packaging, send it off and within 3 working days of receiving the phone, the money agreed will be paid to you. Simple process right? Not for Carphone Warehouse.

I sent the phone via Royal Mail on 8th October and being a 24 hour postal service, it reached and was signed for by someone at carphone warehouse on the 9th October. Giving Carphone Warehouse some time, I waited for a week and after finding that no money had been credited to my account or any form of correspondence to state that my phone has been received at the warehouse, I decided to embark on, what I can only state, as the most stressful and wasteful customer service journey I have ever experienced.

Firstly their customer service team, what can I say? Completely and utterly useless, they have no knowledge of their own products given that one of the customer service advisors asked me whether or not they offer the trade-in service. Carphone Warehouse offer this trade-in service but they have clearly not thought about the service element, there is no manager ever available to speak to, their email service is about as good as a barn door. I can't tell you how many useless customer service advisors I have spoken to in the last few days, all of which give me the same answer and there is no credible escalation policy for something like this.

It has now been 3 weeks since I sent my traded my phone in and having exhausted every method that I can think of, including tweeting and sending letters without any form of response, I am left with no choice but to take this further through legal channels to retrieve the money I should be given.

A note to anyone that is going to use Carphone Warehouse for trade-in's, they are complete cons, they have no f***ing clue how to run a business and completely useless - STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!!!",0
Just ramped my monthly charge from ¬£67 to ¬£73.18 so literally 10%. I know it goes up a little each year but this is a bit much‚Ä¶,0
"This company is NOT TO BE TRUSTED. QUICK MOBILE FIX - they are anything but.
Bought a phone, turned out faulty. Sent it back to them for repair in January. Here we are, nearly end of April and all I get are apologies, excuses, failed deadlines. You name it, they do it. if you want to buy something from this company, you are better off spending that money in a betting shop.",0
"Tryed to contact Argos about a designa friend doll that has awefull stains on her legs from the fabric pants she wore.
Nobody could help me as i did not directly bought the doll at Argos but just wanted to let them know that this doll got very severe stains from the fabric. Nobody wanted to listen. So be careful buying dolls in dark clothes (my doll was Brooke).",0

I sold my daughters Nintendo lite. I have confirmation from the parcel delivery. I contacted you and was told that my Apple device was still on iCloud. I messaged back to say it wasn‚Äôt an Apple product and have messaged so many times but had no response or payment.,0
"Ordered a standard fridge freezer online. Paid and arranged delivery, explained there were stairs at front of house. Also paid extra to get old appliance uplifted. Then a couple of days before delivery they asked for photos of stairs. Then asked for another ¬£60 to delivery upstairs, or they could just leave fridge freezer at roadside. So don't order if you have stairs or live in a flat. Very disappointed. Order number 1139094",0
Very rude delivery driver refused delivery due to steps when I asked to just leave it at bottom he refused managed to finally get through to customer service and they rebooked delivery had a time at 7.30 for delivery on 18/1/23 at 8.23 - 10-23 received an email saying cancelled at 6 am this morning say missed delivery awful service,0
Good bye three. I have been a loyal customer for 6 years .for some reason they choose to use dpd who are not committed to there job. Each day I will stay home waiting for package to arrive all for me to receive a message that I was not around. The last two times I called three and begged for them to deliver the package to a store or give me the dpd address to get package myself and they insisted that it must be a home delivery. Today I was literally standing by the door side and the dpd just walked past my house and I stated shouting stop stop and he looked back and continued walking to his car by the time I came out of my house he drove off. Next I got a message that I wasn't around. I am fed up. I will cancel all the contract I have with three both mine and three other contract. We have to look for a reliable provider.,0

"Their streaming platform is pathetic!! Their app doesn't work and if you try and watch anything on their website platform it takes so many steps to just watch something - you need to download a separate 'tv player' to be able to actually play anything. This takes ages to load, it doesn't automatically play the next episode of a show so you have to close it after one episode then go to the web browser again and find the next episode, and THEN wait a ridiculous amount of time for it to load up in the 'tv player' app again! And then when it does finally play, their streaming is so poor it is blurry the entire episode making the viewing experience rubbish anyway.

Netflix, BBC iplayer, All4 etc have been doing this sort of thing for YEARS and its so much better than NowTV... how can this platform be this bad when they charge so much for it.",0
"Absolutely horrible,
I ordered a phone 3 months ago and the phone was 2 months late and when I asked for a refund they made me WAIT another month and I am STILL waiting. I have not received my money and my phone. This is a mess and very unorganised.",0
"Customer service is non existent. Total liars, scumbags and complete fools. The amount of time wasted on the phone trying to do their job for them.

You can see the other reviews here, they had a nice purple rebrand but they are still losers.",0
"Terrible service. I used to enjoy now tv but now it is just a scam. I can‚Äôt get them to close my account. They take payments, even though my card expired, by contacting my bank without my knowledge. I have been trying to contact customer services. Trying to make a complaint is impossible as they don‚Äôt respond or say there is a technical issue try again later. Avoid avoid avoid!",0

"I sent Envirofone a mint condition, fully working Samsung S9 for which I was given a price of ¬£80. This morning I received a text saying the quote has changed - ¬£20. When I looked into it, they said that the phone was faulty as the screen was not working/no colour which is not true as I look after my phones, and I fully tested it before sending. I have asked for proof via a picture of the faulty screen or return the phone. Smells of a scam, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt until I see proof. Not good... Will update my review when I have further details.

Update: 11th Oct

My phone was re-tested and still failed on the screen. I have requested that my phone is returned to me. I will update when I receive it.

Update: 17th Oct

I received my mobile back from Envirofone this morning. Turned on and.... guess what? Phone and screen working perfectly, no faulty LCD screen or dead pixels as they had said. So they LIED? What is the point? What a waste of my time and their time. Maybe they didn't want to pay out the quoted ¬£80, but maybe they wanted me to accept the ¬£20 reduced offer so that they would make more profit? I will NEVER use Envirofone ever again and I recommend they you don't either! Steer clear of them...

Update: 18th Oct

I took my perfectly working Samsung S9 to CEX and sold it for ¬£107. So that shows that either Envirofone has blind pew working in the testing department or it was their intention to scam the customer, I will let you decide.",0
Paying for 'superfast' fibre - box in street is literally 15 feet from entry point to house - yet I have had to buy another 3rd party router (¬£130) sitting next to yours in hall a tp link (¬£60) and one of your boosters upstsirs and still struggle to get decent signal in bedrooms. It is just a bog standard council house! NEVER had this issue with bt or sky! As soon as contract is over I will be switching! Your doorstep sellers don't tell us how weak your routers are! Very disappointed :0(,0
"Joke, huge argument about my consumer rights on faulty iPhone. Had to take to the ombudsman because they were adamant they would charge for repairing the phone. Then they didn't charge at all, wasting my time. Since found the replacement phone has been waiting for collection for days and nobody told me. The staff in the shop don't know how to use the computer system and had to video call the manager on all three of my visits.",0
"Guildford team ordered the wrong item and created a second finance plan. That was George.When I took back the wrong item to order me the one I wanted, they placed the order but for a wrong color - that was MANAGER Jiya. So I was in the shop for 3 times and still could not help me. So I ended up calling myself the creation provider to cancel one of the accounts. Awful experience at Guildford.",0
I am very disappointed from the service i received i had to return my T.V 4 times for repair and every time they send it back and said they fix it and i have the same problem again i will not sent it to them again i will buy new one i have been insure with them more than 8 years.,0
"I give 1 star as there is no option for a zero rating. I can only echo most of the comments already listed here, the service I have received from bt has been appalling.

They also put this standard reply to make people that read this review think there interested in sorting problem out but they are not
I emailed them with the full details & they don‚Äôt email you back.
Very poor customer service AVOID this company",0
Signed up with them took over 4 months to get me up and running told me I would get ¬£5.23 for each day It was not running so I made it 120 not running they made it 59 but only paid 22 days and could not tell me why I did not get a payment for the other 27 days and then testing my speed over a number of weeks to see I was only getting 50 to 270 mb when they tell you your speed will not go under 423mb and staff are not that helpful and some got ignorant with me.,0

"Utterly awful experience with the Fibre broadband team.

I always try to avoid BT (had an awful experience 10 years ago with them too), but they promised to get me live in 3 days at my new house and convinced me to cancel Hyperoptic (who would have taken about 5 days to go live). BT lied and after a few days told me that it'll take me 10 days to go live.

They blamed OpenReach, who apparently manage the hardware/network. That wasn't my problem and I was told that both companies were one and the same. Spent hours on the phone and was once passed around 7 times. They're a mess. Don't ever ever go with BT.",0
"I bought a fridge freezer for ¬£449 last Friday . I was looking after my 2 grandsons on the day of the delivery . The eldest has high functioning autism .

I‚Äôm worried now that my eldest grandson may have switched it on . I know he said it didn‚Äôt have a light inside . He could have switched it on and off . The delivery guys plunged it in in the socket next to the one I have . I want the new one removed from my house . The fridge capacity is smaller and I hate the colour . The worry has caused me a very sleepless night . Why can‚Äôt it be taken back . I‚Äôm happy to exchange . This is ridiculous !!",0

"Bought an expensive LG washer dryer during black Friday offer and when I rang up to reconfirm the order, their phone staff assured me delivery on Wednesday. However I got confusing emails yesterday about refund and delivery at the same time. Even text messages recieved about delivery around 8.07Am in the morning. Also they sent me email saying can not deliver and stock was not available in the warehouse. Really?? The same item has been listed for 250gbp more now.

Customer service on the phone could not care much and had a worst experience. Funds still not received to paypal.

So many negative reviews and feedback about their aftesales service.

This is the 1st and will be the last time ever going to use this company.",0
"What is wrong with the subtitles on Now TV? I have this problem every time. I started watching the film Dune the other day and subtitles were not available. Today I‚Äôm watching some more of the same film and it says they ARE available. However, when I turn them on, no subtitles appear. On the 4th time of trying it finally worked. However, after 2 minutes they went off again. This same problem has been happening for years now and Nowtv still hasn‚Äôt sorted it out. Terrible service and very discriminatory against those with hearing impairments. Disgusting!",0

"Bark introduced me to a cowboy roofer who did not fix my problem, took my money and then never returned calls when I tried to get him back. I have asked Bark to try and get them to contact me but they haven`t. Then Bark claim that they do not vet the professionals who use them and have told me I should do my own due diligence. I stupidly assumed that Bark would be offering me sound, qualified, trustworthy and honest contractors. I will never use Bark again or recommend them",0

"I'm back again with another review of this 'wonderful' company.

With the news that one of the big mobile companies have started offering upgrades whenever required, I thought I would check my Vodafone contact.

What I discovered is that my Vodafone contact for 24 months is actually more than 30 months long! Presumably because I upgraded early(?) Vodafone have seen fit to add 6 months to my contract!

A contract which began in December 2020 ends in July 2023! My iPhone 11 which already gave up the ghost about 6 months ago because Apple, is supposed to last me two and a half years and still somehow worth ¬£54 per month because naturally the price keeps increasing throughout your insanely long contract.

The way this company operates is truly abhorrent. Other companies are moving with the times while Vodafone customers are stuck firmly in the past, hard-locked into their ancient phones on ever increasing contracts.

Finally, I'll reiterate that the coverage for Vodafone is miserable to say the least. The area I work in? No internet coverage from Vodafone (at all), the area I live in? No internet coverage from Vodafone in 90% of the town, 3g in most of the rest of the areas and 4g maybe 10% of the time. I went to Leeds yesterday, no coverage in at least 60% of the actual city centre!

If you do not want to be locked into 24-30 month stealthy contracts, with next to no coverage, while paying ever-increasing amounts per month for the privilege; I would suggest giving Vodafone a VERY wide berth.",0
Such disappointing service and I feel like I was mis sold my contract. I will be switching provider as soon as my contract ends.,0
"Awful company. Ordered a Pixel 7 on Friday 2nd Dec, no communication (despite the promise that you would be emailed at every point in the process) and no phone by the following Tuesday so had to call them. They explained the handset had been delayed and would arrived the next day. It did, but the sim had not been provisioned. Ended up calling them every day for the following few days, being on hold for over an hour each time, to be told just to wait, turn the phone off and on again, have I put the sim in correctly, leave the phone off for 12 hours. None of which worked. Finally called them on Friday the 9th as the sim still did not work and decided I wanted to cancel the contract and return the handset. Had an extremely difficult conversation with the man on the phone who talked over me, tried to transfer me, refused to listen to what I was saying, and tried to make it out like it was some horrible breakup which is ridiculous and annoying and made me want to leave more. Then said he couldn't do it as the sim hadn't been connected. Eventually managed it but I have not had a confirmation email saying it has been cancelled, and some how miraculously the sim was connected after that phone call. I have not received a pac code but instead a lot of emails saying that my contract has started etc which is the OPPOSITE of what I want. Absolutely furious, my time has been completely wasted and honestly the whole thing feels like a scam.",0
Really poor service. The company that has been used to complete the job have 0 customer service skills. One has even implied that I'm messing around with boiler!,0

"On the 7th of December 2019 I bought a Samsung Galaxy A70 from a Carphone Warehouse store in Dublin on Grafton Street. The phone was a total of 369.99 euro.

On the 6th of June 2020 I went into the shop as my phone stopped working unfortunately. I explained the situation and the staff (two of them) checked my phone for damage. They were not able to find any damage on the phone and they provided me with an ERA Form stating the same.

Furthermore I signed a repair form stating: 'all damage will be repaired to restore the device to Grade A condition.'.

I didn't hear anything for two weeks until they informed me and mentioned that the phone fixing company found a scratch and I have to pay 160 euros to fix it as this doesn't fall within the warranty.

I had several discussions with the staff of Carphone Warehouse in Grafton Street and they mentioned they will get back to me after talking to the phone fixing company. They still were adamant of the fact that my phone was handed in with damage.

After a couple of times going back and forth and including the General Manager of the shop they said they weren't able to provide me with anything and gave me my phone back (without a fix).

I am not happy with the service that I received. I had all the papers to proof that my phone was not damaged and even though of that, they still decided not to provide me a solution. I tried to file a complaint via email via the website of Carphone Warehouse as well as currys.co.uk / ie, but I received an error while filling out the form. They provide an option to chat, but you literally have to search for the button which I wasn't able to find.",0
"When I ordered my microwave/oven, I informed you that I lived in a first floor flat. I was even asked how many stairs there were. When it was delivered, not by AO I was told by the delivery man that he was not supposed to carry it upstairs but just to deliver it. This item was heavy, I am almost 73 years old. Everything I have ordered in the past was delivered and put in my kitchen. I am most disappointed. Why ask how many stairs if you had no intention of carrying it upstairs to my kitchen",0

"Besides the fact that living in central London still meant in certain areas I had no connection (learnt to live with it), Three starting EU roaming charges at the end of May again (thanks for nothing) , the most annoying bit is how I asked them when I need to cancel and waited till a specific date as I didn't want to be double charged but the customer service guy was useless - he kept telling me that three days after using the PAC, my account would be automatically closed. Turns out that is not the case and I will be paying in full for this month as well as for my other provider.
Glad to leave",0
"I have dealt with Wex for years as a Pro photographer and phoned them to agree a PX deal on my MINT Nikon D500. They provided a quote and I agreed the price. I sent the D500 to them and to then be e-mailed saying they had knocked ¬£100 of their quote as I had a scuff on the lens mount! All cameras have this, even when new as soon as you change lenses. They would have known this as my D500 had done 11500 images. In addition they stated that my camera was an import! This was wrong as I have a receipt from a major UK camera dealer. As a client, all they had to do was call me to dicuss this. Bloody terrible service. Won't use them again!",0

I sent it back the moment I became aware I had be signed up to a contract - 2/3 months after.

I‚Äôm a qualified solicitor and they have managed to put me in a situation with no iPad, a contract I never signed up for and no recourse but the ombudsman.

"Now TV's excellent library of content is totally let down by it's medieval business model, extortionate prices and abysmal software.

Business Model: It is an insult that users are forced to pay an additonal ¬£5 per month on top of their subscription to stream in 1080p and without ads.

Extortionate Prices: If you want everything you'd expect from a streaming service - movies, TV shows, 1080p minimum quality & no ads - you will be paying a whopping ¬£25 per month.

Abysmal Software: The apps for Now TV are janky, slow and doesn't even remember where you left off when you return to a movie or show. The UI is unintuitive and convoluted and if you can get past the price, you might not be able to get past how awful their apps are.",0

"Probably the worst company on the planet: Tried to purchase the broadband and calls Fiber offer twice. Each time I register and give them my email, name, address, phone, mobile etc. They then open a new account for me and take my card number and payment details. Then they stops the transaction and asks me to do it again but this time the say I am already having an account and therefore not entitled to the new customer discount. I spoke to them in details over the phone to no avail. They keep my information on their system and refuse to delete it so that I cannot try again in the future which totally illegal. A completely dishonest company based in Ireland with the sole intention of taking people money first and maybe provide some service if you are lucky. They do not provide a contact number but I managed to get one 03303323050. Hopefully this will be of help to others.",0

"I took out a free 7 day trial which I cancelled in the alloted time and have confirmation of. During this time I clicked on the NOWTV app on my TV. They automatically reinstated an old account on an old email address that I have no access to. I had no knowledge of this until they began to take payments. It is impossible to cancel as I do not even know the membership number or the long expired card number which they are actively taking recurring card payments from.
They are absolute con artists, it is impossible to speak with anyone and the live chat is just a robot who cannot help.

"Would score 0 if I could.
I wanted quick payment as seen same day pay out when item is received.
I‚Äôm still waiting 5 days later.
Have emailed more times than I can remember about where in the process I am. Keep getting told it‚Äôs being retested!? Retested for what. The item is practically brand new. When agents do finally get back to me I keep getting told ‚Äúhopefully‚Äù you will get the money today if not tomorrow.
When I highlighted this is not the same day payment processed as advertised I‚Äôve got no response. So basically this company has my item and I‚Äôm out of pocket and can only wait and I‚Äôll probably be doing this for days trying to get my money owed! Pls do not use this this company
P.s

Replying to the comment below. I was told 2 days ago that would be 2 days and when I‚Äôve contacted you again today I‚Äôm b img told a other 2 days. I‚Äôve said I want to complain and nobody has got back to me with this. I should be given an complaints ref number and a resolution to this complaint at least. 3 different agents have been dealing with this and every time I contact you it‚Äôs like the first time I‚Äôve spoke to you. An apology isn‚Äôt good enough and I‚Äôm having to resort to writing on here as nobody is getting back to me with an absolute date and time. If you are saying there is a staff shortage then take down your same day payout guarantee. You have broken this promise with me and exceeded it by a week and I would like to think my complaint would be dealt with. I asked a manager to ring me back and again nothing!

Again updating a few days later after being told it‚Äôs in a queue to be tested and could be another couple of days yet again. Still waiting since this item was received on the 17th March am it‚Äôs now the 24th and still no idea when I‚Äôll get payment. So frustrated and let down again",0
Honestly can not believe the customer Service is so poor. Asked about an upgrade and about very poor signal was just given some drival about early costs on contract was offered s22 on 72 pounds a month yet 55 on uswitch so can they explain that ? 15 years of loyalty and they treat you like a no one be glad my contract ends soon just not good enough when I have no signal in my own home and at work shocking customer service,0

"Total scammers.

Traded in my iPhone 6 in perfect working order as they were offering the same trade-in price as Apple, but with a ¬£50 bonus. This was the ONLY reason I went with them over Apple. Never received confirmation of the bonus amount via email at any stage of the ordering process, which did have me slightly suspicious from the start. After a couple of weeks (which I now assume was to allow the 14-day ""cooling off"" distance selling rule to pass) they then email me with a ""revised"" offer due to ""screen burn""... of just ¬£5!!!

Pretty sure iPhone LCD displays never suffer screen burn. It's only newer OLED displays (iPhone X and newer) that can get this. Either way, I'm sure my iPhone didn't have any screen issues at all.

There is no phone number in their email ""offer"" to call, so I replied directly to the email (which is to tradeuphelp-AT-dixonscarphone.com) rejecting this offer in the strongest terms, only for it to bounce back. Tried a few more times, also from different email accounts, all bouncing back.

Called Carphonewarehouse customer services only to be told the trade-up service can only be contacted via email!
Having now looked on here I see this ""screen burn"" claim is a common theme for them to try to weasel out of their initial over-inflated trade-in offer.

The email gives just 10 days for me to accept or reject their offer, otherwise they claim they will ""process"" the new offer. So, without me being able to contact them, they are planning to steal my phone and give me just ¬£5. Outrageous.",0
Terrible after sales service. If you have a big issue you will never be allowed to speak to a manager and after making 13 calls and speaking to a Customer service advisor not a single one calls back. I also contacted all relevant managers via LinkedIn in and not one responded. I ordered a plumbed in American style freezer and was delivered a non plumbed in. They don‚Äôt have the knowledge or expertise in the call centre to deal with complaints and don‚Äôt care. Wonder if anyone will bother to respond? Doubtful.,0
"We had a leaking washing machine and a rubber seal had torn, which is what I put in the description. A Engineer came round had a look at it said he needs to get some tools goes downstairs comes back up Puts mud all over the carpet puts the rubber ring around the seal incorrectly plus the seal is torn and then leaves and says the job is done. My wife asks him a simple question on how to clean the washing machine, and the way he speaks to her as if she is dumb.",0

Signed up for broadband with Vodafone. Received emails confirming the order and contract stating the equipment would be delivered within a week and service would start 3 days later. A week later I'd received nothing and heard nothing from them. I had to contact them to find out the contract hadn't completed successfully. Left me hanging with rubbish communications for a communications company. Opted for BT instead... equipment delivered the next day and online the day after.,0

I ordered a product in November went to collect in December nobody reutned up at the store so I wnr back later to be told that it has been sent back to Argos as there was a time time limit which I wasn't notified of.

The service is xxx their staff are xxxx and there help is xxxx. a truly corrupt

"Signed up to Broadband & Phone deal that had 6 months Entertainment pass to watch Game of Thrones. After 6 months speeds slowed and are now near unusable. (Download speed of 0.9mbps with wired connection) Been in contact with Now TV over 10 times over the past 6 months and having jumped through all the hoops, spent money replacing sockets etc have now been told that the lines used to supply our house are limiting speeds to 2.03mbps (conveniently Now TV guaranteed minimum speed is 2.0mbps) which we clearly don't get. Previous ISP's were able to supply more than this so they are clearly lying.

In addition to the above I had to update card details due to expired card, a payment was taken last month using the new card but we have now been cut off for non-payment for this month.

The whole experience from the start has been extremely poor. Terrible speeds, non-existent customer service, online chat doesn't work and cuts you off, phone numbers don't work, website is horrendous and just directs you to a useless online forum etc etc.

SAVE YOURSELF LOADS OF HASSLE AND PLEASE DO NOT GIVE THIS COMPANY ANY OF YOUR MONEY!

"I am not prepared to write the whole complaint as I have spent far to much time on this so far.

Please see list of issues:
1. Shutting a complaint down without speaking with me, this is for me to agree if a complaint has been resolved.
2. Trying to make me cancel my new contract as you have made a error. (Illegal).
3. Trying to close my contract and then up sell me for a far more expensive contract.(illegal).
4 changing my order and cancelling what was agreed in conversation and in writing, when items sent for despatched as agreed these are then cancelled out again.

I have calculated that I have spent a total of 16hrs on. problem that is still not resolved, the frustration and anger cannot be avoided, the stress caused is not acceptable and I am paying for something I do not have, a Manager is never available, have no choice than to start a long drawn out legal complaint as 16hrs with BT we are now in a far worse place than when I started, complete incompetence

"The most horrendous customer experience I have ever received. Ordered a wardrobe that arrived damaged and with missing pieces. Called up to request new ones sent (was told they were in stock and would arrive shortly). 10 days later still not here I call and am told they are not in stock for another 3 weeks. I want a refund but am then told I need to dismantle everything at my own expense and time ( having already paid for someone to assemble in the 1st place).

"Probably hard to experience a worst service - never again. Ordered a replacement fridge/freezer - which is fine - and paid for the pick up/replacement service. The drivers‚Äô took the old one out of its place and put the new one in and then said they didn‚Äôt have space to take it on the van; despite the size being the same. They left it in our hallway for a week while we waited for them to collect it. Collection day came, where my wife took a day off work, and they said they could collect it again. The delivery people left it on the driveway and said someone would be there the next day. We called to complain and the Customer service person confirmed it would definitely be the next day - and was very apologetic. That was 3 days ago and we still have the fridge freezer on the drive despite trying to call and email. It‚Äôs identical in size to the one we bought and access is a breeze. AO suck and we should never have bought from them. I‚Äôm about to call my credit card to demand a full refund and for the new and old device to be taken away so I can buy from a retailer who can deliver the service they advertise rather than ripping us off. Total con - AO are jokers",0
"Absolute nightmare to cancel. Ignored correspondence giving notice of cancellation and left us waiting on hold for hours (both on the phone and online chat) when trying to speak to someone about recent emails. On some occasions, we got through to some people who were entirely unsympathetic and unsure of procedures transferring you from one member of staff to the next, other times, no one answered. They continued sending my 70 year old Nan bills despite her being with another provider which really worried her and caused her distress. After she just paid the money for another 30 days to sort the situation and for another notice period, our family ensured the contract was over and asked Virgin not to contact her ever again. There has been two/three calls since then asking her why she left and asking if she would like to sign up again.

UPDATE:
Four months later and still ongoing. On Christmas Day (a few weeks later after paying all the money), my Nan was so worried and telling us that they have sent her another bill. Absolutely disgusting.",0
"Ah the great carphone warehouse con.......
sent my phone for repair , broken screen...""should have it back in about a week""... great i thought . A fixed fee of ¬£174 .....mmmmm could buy a new phone for that , to replace with a new one same model ¬£220, any trade in between ¬£2---¬£20 ....mmmmm I like the phone had it for 3 years , So went ahead with the repair . Left it with the carphone warehouse in the belief that i had already paid.... as a normal process when you put your debit/credit card in the machine tap in your code and press enter ...an expectation of money transfer ensues......Team Know F***All sent me an email saying that they would like to GIVE me a phone whilst the repair takes place...OOOH sounds good ,,,,but left it there as the carphone warehouse had already lent me a Huwai 360y ,,,,,after realising that i could only recieve 2g/3g service thought about the offer . Upon enquiring was told that i would have to BUY the refurb phone. A little bell went off in my head ,,,,where is my phone .. ihad to ask several times before being told that it had been sent to SBE UK ltd ..Ok used the track my repair system that kept returning ""no known device"" ... So back to phoning Team Know F***All ""we have definitely sent it to them"". A phone call later that day ""we have your phone now and will be returning it to you"".. Yeah i thought ......then it arrived , wrapped in a plastic envelope ,,my heart sank ..did it survive the journey ,,,, Well i didnt matter because nothing had been done , returned to me in exactly the same state ... upon contacting SBE UK ltd ,they had never received the phone .....It never left Team Know F***All.... It would appear to be a scam to sell refurbished phones.... And after checking my account it would appear that no transaction took place ... Now how does that work. Moral of the story find the appropriate repairs manufacturer and phone them they will email a link for you to print off an address label directly to themselves and cut out the middle men like Team Know f***All........",0

I have tried to raise this with NOWTV but it is IMPOSIBLE to (A) speak to a person and (B) find out how and why they are taking money.

"I went to Carphone Warehouse in Lower Sydenham, Bell Green Park to sign up for a pay monthly mobile plan with Samsung Note 10 Plus 5g. The manager in charge, when we got there around 7pm, helped us with the contract (Vodafone) and kept saying that CPW only carries the 5g version and we had it ordered as they had none in stock at that moment. We believed him, and when we checked the receipt it didn't say Samsung Note 10Plus 5g he reassured us that it is 5g and said ""even the sim card is 5g ready"". The next day, we (my partner and i) came at 730pm to collect the phone and we got the phone. My partner was looking at the box for the SN number to confirm it is 5g, the manager said again that ""don't worry that is note 10 plus 5g. We only offer 5g version. Don't worry. It doesn't say on the box but it is 5g"". We walked out and my partner googled the SN number to confirm. We found that it is NOT the 5g set and went back to him. AGAIN, he INSIST it is 5g and INSIST that CPW only carries 5g version of the phone. We told him to check in front of us and then he mumbled to his colleague (he was also training the guy) that ""5G won't be rolled out fully and it will take 2 years to so it's no point getting a 5g phone now"" KNOWING FULL WELL HE MADE A VERY BIG MISTAKE. When he FINALLY admitted he was wrong, the system will not let him do a 1 to 1 exchange even though the tariffs for non 5g and 5g are the same. Now, here's the best part he said he can exchange the phone but will have to CANCEL the contract and do up a new one BUT Vodafone will 99.99% REJECT the new contract because they'll have to run another credit check etc. and kept repeating it three times. (WHY? to avoid going through the hassle???) anyway, we walked out of the store and the next day went to a vodafone store to confirm his allegations. Vodafone store manager said that once credit check has been approved, they wouldn't do another check as we're already a customer. and for whatever reasons, CPW manager was lying to us to save his butt. We could cancel the contract DUE TO HIS MISTAKE and probably have to pay a penalty DUE TO HIS MISTAKE. We then decided it's not worth the hassle because the CPW manager told us once signed, we can't change our minds etc. How is this guy a manager when he either is ignorant of the products and the products code in his system or he is just a plain liar who wants to sell the mobile contracts to get his % up. Horrible experience. I have already sent the same complaint to Vodafone to be aware of this manager who served us and lied to us and threatened us about Vodafone not accepting our new contract if we decided to go with the exchange. He didn't deliver what we, as customers want. SO WHAT IF 5G WON'T BE ROLLED OUT UNTIL 2 YRS?! You only said that cause YOU WERE CAUGHT WITH YOUR MISTAKE. WE WANT A 5G PHONE TO FUTURE PROOF . YOU THINK WE CHANGE PHONES EVERY YEAR OR WHAT?! I USE MY NOTE 5 FOR SO MANY YEARS NOW!!!!!!!! THIS IS A MAJOR UPGRADE FOR ME AND WILL BE FOR A LONG TIME UNTIL I DECIDE IT IS TIME TO UPGRADE MY PHONE. THIS IS MY LOSS NOT YOURS! LIAR!!!!!!!!!",0

2. Why your prices gone up after a few months of joining you but my contract is not to end with any plan of new changes to the price!!

4.

So my husband ordered the phone over the phone with the sales team. I then got confirmation that the phone I had ordered had been dispatched. We now have 2 iPhone 11's with EE contracts and cannot speak to anybody from customer services about returning one of them. We got through to the sales team no problem but all they want is a sale and are not interested in helping when actually it was their false information about the credit being declined the second time that prompted us to buying the second phone.

"EDIT:
The installation was pushed forward to the 9th as we were put on ‚Äòpriority‚Äô due to the hassle we‚Äôve experienced however upon asking TalkTalk for written confirmation of this I‚Äôm now told the 15th-16th. I am so angry because at this point it‚Äôs taking the absolute mick!


I rang up and took out a contract on the 5th of October to be installed on the 1st of November as my previous broadband provider's contract was coming to an end on the 3rd of November. Thought perfect, that's sorted!

No router gets delivered as it was NEVER SENT to begin with!! It gets shipped out on the 1st/2nd of November but the tracking number can't be given to me as it ""wasn't generated in the system"". This I know to be utter bull as I use Yodel to send orders regularly and the tracking number is generated the same time the label is created so it's probably not been posted at all but we'll see!

Next thing, Openreach were meant to carry out the installation on the 1st of November. Another no-show as according to TalkTalk they still needed to survey the property before carrying out the installation despite coming to my house on the 20th of October.

As it stands my installation date is now the 11th of November meaning I have to go just over a week with no broadband when I scheduled everything to transition seamlessly.. I know, first-world problems and all but this hinders my work and family life so I am thoroughly fed up!

Severely regret my decision with TalkTalk, if I still have no installation by or on the 11th I WILL be leaving, I'll cancel the bank card if I have to because I am not paying a single penny for a service I haven't even used due to their continued negligence",0
"Ordered food which never arrived, however we have been left footing the bill. Rang the driver a few times, he never answered. I waited outside my house several times, no sign of him

"I had a sim internet package with 3 and from day one it‚Äôs was absolute rubbish I was getting 1mbps I wish I was exaggerating but I‚Äôm not throughout the time of this contract I complained 3 times and they went through the same process each time and nothing changed was still just as bad no matter how many times I told them it wouldn‚Äôt work they tried to make out it was me and said ring back if it doesn‚Äôt improve in the end I gave up and stopped the contract as soon as the date ended

"So it started when we were looking for a washer dryer from curry's. We wanted to make sure it was covered against breakdowns. I asked a member of staff if the warranty covered us within a business. 'No' I was told 'but if you purchase this plan with your washer dryer it will be'. That's great, we were happy to buy everything under that promise.

Fast forward to when the washer/dryer breaks down. I was told we didn't have a care plan. After finding the receipt and quoting the product code I was told they still couldn't help. I had to take the receipt into the store before anything was done. After driving to the store with the original receipt we finally get the ball rolling.

After a week or so we were told 'the service engineer couldn't find the property so he left. You will have to wait another week'. Fast forward another week. 'The original engineer has the part and is off sick, you'll have to wait another week or two'.

I call to complain. I'm told, 'I don't know what to tell you mate, we won't actually be carrying out the repair and we will be cancelling your plan. You're a business so you aren't covered'. After stating that I was sold the product and plan under the pretence that we were covered as a business I'm met with the response, 'so what would you like me to do about it?'. After explaining that I would like my complaint dealt with as a complaint I'm then told 'give it a week or two and get in touch if you don't hear anything'.

I have never in my life experienced worse customer service than what I've experienced with this company. Lying, mis-selling, rude, unhelpful and incompetent.

"absolutely rubbish.ordered a contract with handset on the online store but changed my mind and cancelled the order the same morning that it supposed be delivered.the item was send back the very same day by DPD and was received the day after by them.
So far so good normally CPW should tell the network(O2 in this case)that the item was returned and the contract should be cancelled usually within 3 to 5 days, the problem is that for some reason this has not happen, called countless times, send at least 10 emails and chatted online many times but been told that the case is been escalated to the warehouse ,but nothing has happened and now I been charged and under contract becouse they failed to cancel the contract and not doing so after almost 3 week.i am still waiting for something that should be done long ago and all they say in there email is the same broken record excuse.dont use they are useless and they get away with murder.i feel I been cheated in to in to a contract I did not want.avoid",0

Terrible customer support and i would advise any that uses Now TV to check that they are not being charge for a service they dont use or have any seperate accounts you are unaware of as they are probably making a lot of money from this.",0
"This company is terrifyingly deceptive and cruel. My contract finishes on 25/02, so I have informed them 31 days in advance that I won't be renewing. It took 4 HOURS, for someone on the chat to finally accept my decision, I asked over 7 times to confirm they understood and accepted I would not be continuing the service. I am on a ¬£24/per month contract but they will be billing me for my final bill of ¬£47 because I am now on 'a standard rate' for the final month of my contract. This is the most contradictory statement I've ever heard. If I'm still within contract price, how can you apply standard rate prices. This is the response I am getting: ""I do understand that but once your contract ends, you will be continuing the same package that you have at a standard rate that is why you are billed for ¬£47.25. And since we bill a month in advance and your contract has around 30 days remaining, that is why you are already within the 'out of contract' period from us.""
It doesn't even make sense?! I am not renewing my contract, and ending my services when my contract ends, so HOW on earth can you charge me ¬£47.25 post this date?! I am trying so hard to stop them from doing this and getting nowhere. Their other solutions is 'Don't pay the bill then' why would I risk my credit rating for this company? What a stupid answer.
I also moved house 2 months ago, and they sneakily put me on a brand new contract from the date I moved house, which was also below board and quite possibly illegal? After again having to contact these people for 2 hours, they then conceded that I did not accept, or renew the contract when I moved house and switched back to the old dates - disgraceful tactics.",0
"Their service is absolutely awful! Sent a laptop for a repair and it was due to return within the next week...... It took a bloody month to come back. Not only they took the Micky for it to come back so late, they sent it to the wrong address! I had to pay for a train ticket just to retrieve it! I‚Äôm not even finished yet, so don‚Äôt think this is all over. I demanded for compensation for this poor service, they said they‚Äôll send me a ¬£40 gift voucher and it will arrive within the next 3-5 days..... It‚Äôs been over 3 weeks and it‚Äôs still not arrived! I phone them up for the 15th time asking why it‚Äôs not arrived and the fella on the phone said it will take up to 28 days to arrive! Blimey I can‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt see that coming! But that‚Äôs not all..... As my laptop had a display problem they had to deal with the screen and I‚Äôve just noticed they haven‚Äôt attached the screen properly! Surely that‚Äôll mean a free laptop replacement is coming my way! What a s**t service, never go there! They‚Äôre clueless and they treat their customers awful!

"Traded in my iphone against a new Iphone 11 - two weeks went by no moneys received for trade in. Contacted on chat who confirmed they had received the phone two weeks earlier, said they would 'escalate it'.

"I had an issue with my ghd straightener. I went to check online for my guarantee period and I was told they were out of it. That was not correct as they are the Gold series and are meant to have 3 years guarantee (they were bought in Dec 2019). I spoke with the customer service and they told me I could send them back as, quite rightly, they were still within the guarantee period. They sent me a link for the return form and prepaid label to return them.
Initially, the link did not work for me. I wrote them back requesting a new one but I have never received a response back again. My email was sent on the 25/11/21. The agent I was dealing with was Victoria Fajilade.
After a number of times trying and on the lack of any response, I managed to get the initial link to work and I have sent the straightener back to Ghd.
So far I have not received any further news about them.
As this issue has not been resolved as quickly as I thought it would be, I have had to buy a new set of straighteners with the consequent cost.
Overall, really disappointed with the customer service level comparing with what I would have expected from Ghd.
I have 5 Ghd items and buy regularly products buy this experience will make me reconsider buying anything else in the future.",0
"Worst experience I have ever had with a delivery company.
Ordered a delivery, was phoned and told the driver had an ""incident"" and the food was not coming.
Asked if we want to reorder the food and delivery would be 50 minutes.
90 minutes later we phoned and were told the driver had left the restaurant. Then were told the driver wasn't at the restaurant yet. Then were told the driver was assigned. Then we were phoned to say the second driver had an ""incident"" and we were not getting any food.
We were then asked if we want a refund it would take 10 working days.
The company is an absolute joke and the customer service team were constantly lying to prevent them from refunding our money. Shocking way to run a business.

"Everyone BE VERY VERY CARFUL with bt internet. Always ask for a contract and do not agree to anything verbally over the phone. They caught me out, the first time was when the internet stopped working and had been playing up for weeks (I could not get through) the contract had run out a while ago but they said nothing and kept taking payments. There was a problem with the line and they would only fix if I agreed to a contract so over the phone I agreed to a new contract because I really needed it at the time for work. Then later it stopped again and I said I wanted to cancel they wanted 650 quid. I have never seen a contract from them and have looked all over the site for it, I have asked them to email one but still to this day I have not seen one from them. Now with only a few months left on the contract I have no choice but to cancel and guess what they want money again 110 quid this time. (I haven't even used it for 6 months because I moved out and have been paying for nothing). Other providers don't do this sse is only max 200 odd cancel. So everyone please be careful and check everything (even if desperate and need it quick) unless you want to be tied in for years.",0

Have you ever tried to speak to a person at Vodafone? There are So many hurdles to jump through it‚Äôs unbelievable! Now, finding the information you need off their website is like finding a needle in a haystack, either it‚Äôs evasive or buried in soooo much text you need hours and hours to sift through it. SIMPLIFY THE INFORMATION!! You‚Äôve managed it on your VOXI SITE.
PLUS, charge everyone ¬£0.50 more for their contract and give EVERYONE back EU roaming. You are giving everyone an itch to scratch. It‚Äôs irritating to go back decades and have to buy ‚Äòbolt ons‚Äô in order to use your UK allowance in the EU. Please don‚Äôt use the Brexit excuse, that‚Äôs well worn now. If o2 can do it so can you. Get a grip pan give the marketing people a kick and tell them to stop being plonkers. People will walk because of this.

Fast forward two weeks and my connection is cut off because the request wasn't cancelled as I was advised.

The solution they came back with is for me to signup to a new contract with them.

Edit - Regarding the response. It's totally missed the point that I was told the cease request had been cancelled.",0
"Having bought a dishwasher from Curry's PCWorld a year ago, I received an invitation to sign up for Team Knowhow. Previously, Currys' support came through Domestic & General who, though pricey, have always been excellent. This looked cheaper and so we tried to give it a try. The operative word here is ""tried"". Three attempts to call, totalling over two hours, produced no answer. I then sent the e-mail below to the support address given in the letter. It bounced, with the message: ""Your message wasn't delivered due to a permission or security issue. It may have been rejected by a moderator, the address may only accept e-mail from certain senders, or another restriction may be preventing delivery""

Here's the e-mail I wanted to send:

Good Morning,

Having already spent well over an hour on two calls waiting for a response to your support line, I'm currently waiting yet again, listening to endless repetitions of your ""our colleagues know you are waiting and will be with you as soon as possible"" message. 

I now feel it unlikely that you will be able to provide service for my dishwasher but, to pass the time, I'm making a final attempt via e-mail. Surely, if your call centre is inadequate, it would make sense to offer online sign-up - or is that too twenty-first century for you?

When we purchased, we were told that you no longer recommend Domestic & General, with whom I currently have support contracts for:

Fridge freezer
Washing machine
Televisions x 3
Central heating system

The dishwasher now being a year old, I received an invitation to take cover with KnowHow. Your scheme is certainly cheaper, so we gave you a try. D&G typically answer within a minute. You don't answer at all. I now have the choice of a single, well-supported contact point for service, or save a few quid on an empty promise from you.

As from tomorrow, our dishwasher has no cover. If you actually want my business, I suggest you contact me within the next 24 hours to reassure me that you actually have some customer support in place.

Regards,

Jem Shaw

P.S. Another 25 minutes of national-rate waiting, which have, no doubt, provided you with a small additional profit, have now convinced me that you're a hopeless case. to pass the time a little more, I've been reading your one-star reviews on TrustPilot. first stop, back to D&G, then on to TP to add my voice to the saga of disaster. 

Congratulations, you lose.

"Very dissapointed. Using the online store for convenience has turned out to be not convenient at all. After being allowed to purchase 2 items online to then be told sometime after that 1 of the items are out of stock and then waiting for a month for the item to come into stock (which was my choice to wait as I trusted HMV with my purchase), the item has arrived damaged and as the packaging was intact, the item was sent damaged by HMV with clearly no QA involved at all. The Vinyl is unplayable. (photos were sent to HMV to show this). To get the item replaced means going to a store miles away which makes the online shopping experience not convenient or efficient. Very sad that HMV don‚Äôt concentrate too much on the customer experience when things go wrong other than being told you can only go in store to exchange. So now the gift recipient, after looking forward to their gift nearly a month after their birthday, has the hassle of waiting for this to be resolved with no HMV local to them and they live some miles away which is part reason the item was ordered online initially. A big company as HMV should really look at improving the customer experience when purchasing online. The other option of sending goods back for a refund is of no comfort when purchasing a gift for someone who has already had to wait. Not only do I have to wait for the item to be returned, despite having clear images of the damage, they hold on to my money until it gets back so I cannot afford to replace the gift until they get it back. ¬£60 is a lot of money to trust with a company that has already shattered trust. It may be a Taylor Swift album that was purchased but I‚Äôm not going to simply ‚ÄòShake it Off!‚Äô",0
Shouldn't even deserve 1 star. Same issue as Shaun below - went into the Fenchurch St London Store yesterday.

I ordered my new iphone xs yesterday, it arrived today which is great but when i opened it i realised i ordered 64GB instead 254GB. So i thought i can just exchange it and pay the difference. I called online customer service and was advised i can either do it online where i need to send my phone back and wait for new one or i can just go to store and do it there and get new phone straight away. So i choose option 2 and went to branch in Tooting Broadway. I spend there 1.5 hours and even after that time they didnt know how to do it as it was online order. I got so angry and just left. When i got home i phone online customer service once again and was advised by Sia that she doesnt understand why this happend , that they should have just done it. She reassured me that if i go to any other store they will just exchange it for me. So i thought ok i will give you one more chance and went to Brixton branch which i far away from me( i knew they have phone i want in stock) to find out they CAN NOT exchange online order in store!!!!

"Customer Service is the absolute worst. Our internet stopped working on the 31st December. After multiple attempts to speak to someone, we finally managed to get through the long, repetitive tests and checks so that Talk Talk sent out an engineer on Tuesday 10th January. The engineer determined no fault in the line and said we needed to call Talk Talk to ask for a new router, which he also wrote in his report. We spent hours on the phone to Talk Talk on Tuesday and after a very long and confusing conversation, where they spent tens of minutes checking their system and asking us to call back later, which we did, and then being transferred from person to person... they literally promised that they were posting a router. I asked for this in writing and they promised I would receive an email. I said I wouldn't leave the call until I had it in writing. I asked to speak to their manager. They basically just spoke nonsense and non-statements until I got fed up and left the call, but having been verbally promised a router was in the post and would arrive in 2-3 working days. It is now Friday. 3 working days later. I call to see where the router is as nothing has arrived. The customer service representative says no router has been ordered. I have to wait a long time (over half an hour) whilst they order me one. They cannot provide proof in writing over email that they have actually ordered it this time, either! I just can't with Talk Talk. They have the worst customer service in the world. I will be leaving as soon as possible. This is not the first time I have experienced similar. Last year internet broke for days and days and they closed my complaints and refused to compensate me, and when I tried to get in touch to resolve this and get compensation, multiple agents left me on hold for such a long time (over an hour) that I eventually had to leave the calls. The tactic is to ignore, delay, and I'm sure they don't care that customers will go away, which is crazy. Horrible experience.",0
"Honestly I wouldn't bother shopping with these unless you enjoy disappointment!
Brought my wife some GHDs, costing over ¬£160, that part all fine,I then see the dreaded email that it's been dispatched to Evri...why they would use a delivery company known on losing parcels and theft for such an expensive item is beyond me! Anyways I had hope....

Within two days tracking hadn't updated (should of been here by now) and then I get a notification from my bank that GHD have refunded me....I had never asked for the refund nor aware why they had,emailed them and no response (4 days later still no response).

Tracking still the same,emailed Evri and they stated it was lost (and my other 3 packages i wad also waiting for).

Still no response so why I got the refund without asking to start with, as would of preferred a replacement and picked up.

Ended up buying cloud nine straighteners and honestly think they are way better and better value for money!",0
"Why say a product is in stock online. You then order it and it's not available. Complete Waste of my time and Hughes.

I purchased the stick from Tesco whilst we were waiting for Sky to set up our tv. Since then I have cancelled the passes 3 times but they keep automatically renewing and taking more money. It is impossible to speak to anyone. I will have to go via my bank to try and block them. Frustrated!,0
"just had the annual valet done to my 12 month old washing machine which started to emit a slight odour. the cleaner who arrived barely spoke any english and wouldnt even understand simple questions. as for the cleaning it was absolutely terrible and a waste of mone yand time, he simply used a dirty tissue roll to wipe down a water like spray whic hhe sprayed onto the clean washing machine. my 5 year old brother couldve put more effort and cleaned it better. defo do not recommend taking out a plan with them.",0

"Appalling! Took a call from a BT sales person who mis-sold me a BT business package under the guise it would reduce my monthly bill for BT internet. After several hours of dealing with customer services, the package was cancelled as a mis-sale. I was assured the cancellation of the BT business package would not affect my home internet. Now we‚Äôve no internet, but still being charged. Every time I call customer services I get passed from one department to another who tell me ‚Äúthat‚Äôs dealt with part of the BT group and we don‚Äôt share data‚Äù. I‚Äôve spent hours (close to 10 hours across several days) and still haven‚Äôt gotten it resolved. So, so, bad.",0
"Not surprised the reviews are as awful as they are, f-ing grimy slimy company charging me for things I have no clue about, and I‚Äôm not an idiot but they just charged me without me having a clue when it was supposed to be a free trial, they also started a separate membership for me without my consent which had I not noticed would have went on to charge me ¬£5 every month, and they make it so f-ing confusing and difficult to cancel each of these memberships, and good luck getting a refund, SCUM COMPANY",0

"Do NOT switch to or contract with BT for Broadband and TV!
We agreed the deal 3 months before our Sky Contract finished and thought that would be long enough for BT to get themselves sorted in time - apparently not!
They failed to deliver the equipment in time for contract start, the alleged Technical 'Expert' failed to show on the agreed date and when he did appear he rushed in and said he had 30 minutes to do the install and show us everything. He was so rushed he didn't do the job properly, the system didn't work properly and we were completely confused!
Rang the Complaint Team next day who were actually helpful and they booked another 'Expert' for a 2 hour slot 5 days later and promised it would all be sorted.
5 days later, the same 'Expert' arrived (45mins late) and the first thing he said was 'I've only got 30 mins'. Enough! Told him not to bother and that we were cancelling the contract. He suddenly tried to become helpful but it was too late, we'd had enough.
We rang Sky straightaway and they were very helpful, gave us a great deal to rejoin and as we still had the equipment reconnected us immediately
BT were utterly useless and took every opportunity to let us down and mess it up.
Do NOT contract with or switch to BT.",0
"Absolute nightmare experience. Staff were nice enough however plenty of promised phone calls that never materialised and spent the whole day chasing them up.

"Terrible customer service, firstly my new phone got sent to my old address after changing it with the guy on the phobe who was selling me then new phone, secondly they sent me the wrong colour, after complaining i was told to take it to my nearest shop to swap it with the right colour. Went to the shop in swansea city center and was told they didnt have the colour without even checking, i then asked where is the nearest shop with my requested colour in stock, i was told morfa. Travelled to morfa and i was told be the carephone warehouse manager to go over to currys as they are closing that shop in the next two weeks and i wouldnt be able to return it! Went over to currys and they had to send a member of staff over to the shop i just came from to get the correct colour phone. Then after waiting around 20mins i was told they could not swap the phone (even know it was there on the desk) and i have to send it back in the post (i hadent even opened my phone from the packaging at this point) i was fuming at this point and then i was told theres a dpd point behind me in currys and to pop over and send it off there. After waiting in the dpd que for 10mins i was then told i cant send it back unless its properly packaged and a returns email printed out to attatch! The dpd guy took me over to the carphoneware house staff asking why they had sent me there without the correct documentation and they said oh ye sorry. Unbeleivable!!!!! I then had to take the phone home and send it off seperately. I then rang to raise a complaint and got throughto a fireign bloke who i could hardly understand, who listened to my complaint and said i can give you ¬£15 credit to spend in store, i asked him if it was a joke as i had spent over ¬£15 on petrol and over 3hrs of my saturday afternoon trapsing around 3 different shops, he said theres nothing more he can do but raise the complaint further and i would hear back off someone withing the next 3-5 days. Two weeks later and no reply! I contacted the customer service team again and yet again got through to a hard to understand person who told me hes not sure why the last bloke tokd me soneone would be in touch as theres nothing they can do about it.

Sent an iPhone mini 12 in PERFECT condition and received an email offering me just under ¬£200 less than originally advised based on a problem with the vibration motor. There was absolutely nothing wrong with my phone, it was in mint condition when I sent it and I actually had it checked over by a local company before sending to mazuma who offered me ¬£30 less than them so ultimately decided to use mazuma, what a mistake.

There is literally no way of getting in contact with them urgently to rectify this. No contact number available, the online messenger is robotic and not run by an actual customer service staff member so it couldn't help with my request.

"Thank you for this opportunity to let me air my experience with QM Fix performance.

few weeks ago i ordered Apple I phone 6 S Plus with a plug & charge cables,QM Fix gave price and confirmed they are in stock so i paid cash circa ¬£120.00

Again before subject delivery i ordered apple plug just because this seller on line sounded credible. I was happy because in no time this order was executed.

Trouble started when i followed up the earlier order of ¬£120.00 each time I sent them email no answer or advice from QM FIX.

No answer made me disturbed and I asked for money back and they sent me hash reply
''The order is now cancelled, and can't be re-instated, The refund time frame is 14 working days and accounts team will be advising you when the refund is processed.''
Such reply is cruel to customer that I paid cash and that refund is going to wait next 2 weeks & if you add the other 3 weeks since a date i credited cash to QM FIX thus over a month somebody holding your money?

Please out there be careful to deal with this organisation or else you fingers are gonna burn like mine..,

"We placed an order for ¬£70. It was not delivered and the refund was refused. During the complaint to customer services, the gentleman explained that the driver was at my home and waited 7 minutes, but gave up. The evidence is based on his GPS. About 50 meters from our flat is a cul de sac of a neighbouring street. I was waiting late at night by the door as the driver was near, and I heard a scooter parking in the cul de sac, but I could not see it. On the call I wanted to avoid the technicalities: you charged me for something I never received, and you admit that I never received it. He was sorry, but still a refund is impossible. So I explained that we are Deliveroo Plus customers and have spent over 30k with them. We cannot continue if this is the policy. The gentleman asked for a few minutes to discuss with his manager. He came back with a definite answer: NO refund. They lost us now. It is a shame, because it's an inspiration story about the founder quiting his banking job and personally doing deliveries. The service was very good up to the pandemic. But look at their stock performance over the past year. I guess he expanded too fast and ended up with a bad culture. Good luck mate.",0

Going to take this matter further. Disgusting service.

Funny how they can reply through trustpilot and suggest customer services can help, but it‚Äôs customer services that are dealing with the problems! N",0

I‚Äôve used the company many years ago and always been excellent in service. I sent in my Iphone SE which was in immaculate condition. Originally offered ¬£90 to then be told the camera lens has black spots so knocked down to ¬£35! After reading these negative reviews it‚Äôs interesting how many other people have been told the same thing and had a reduced price on their phone. I accepted the offer as after reading more of these reviews the likelihood is that i would end up paying for the phone to be returned. My partner was going to use the company to sell his phone but after this experience will be using another company.,0
"My experiences with BT have taught me the company would rather shaft you than keep you. and they will no longer be a company I will deal with. I have cancelled Internet, Phone, Mobile and TV with them. A shame as it had started to well. When I left my home due to divorce and we had to sell every other service provider treated it as a house move and cancelled the contracts. but BT would not and I had to pay ¬£175 cancellation fee and other charges. fast forward 14 months I have my own place a new internet provider organised (not BT) only to be told there would be a 6 week delay in total as BT had delayed the removal of their equipment by 4 weeks. I presume only because i hadn't chosen to go with them like the last owner. BT only seem to be able to cost me large sums of money while providing nothing. and even if i wanted to go with them their contract is twice the price for the same speed.",0
BT conned us into a new package saying speed would increase. It did for 1 week after we signed up to a new package - then it went back to where it was. BT customer service - which NEVER answer the phone - complete waste of time.,0
"I will never buy another product from Currys again.

I purchased an under counter fridge and freezer by Kenwood 6 months ago. For the past few days I have been trying to get through to someone anyone at Currys to report the fact the fridge is falling apart. The door does not close, it is not getting cold like it should be and is leaking water at the back and I had to switch it off because it started making worrying noises.

I went to the Currys shop near me today where I thought the shop assistant at the repairs counter was actually being helpful (fool for me). She gave me a contact number to contact ‚ÄúKenwood‚Äù who should ‚Äúsend out someone‚Äù. I should have called the number there and then in the store. When I got home and called I realised she had given me a ‚Äúnumber for Kenwood‚Äù which actually leads straight to the useless Currys customer service line.

"Customer service doesn't give a damn about your opinions. They politely respond to any queries raised via their ticket system, but when you receive an answer via email and wish to reply back it says that their inbox is full and that the message couldn't be delivered. My problem with them was their "" promotional trailers"" when watching now tv. They're not my cup of tea(horror and thriller shows), so I wanted to be offered the option to skip them at least like Prime Video does.
BTW, my case number is 11075424 .",0
"Had a mint condition iphone 11 pro. They offered ¬£280 initially. My phone had been put in a case and screen protected from the box. A diagnostic check was done before resetting the phone. All passed and not a single scratch. Not even any wear and tear marks. Photos and screenshot of diagnostic test was taken as proof. I should have taken the EE offer there and then. It was sent in its original box which was wrapped in bubble wrap and sealed inside another box, so it could not have been damaged in transit.

They then said that then said that their engineers will send photos of the scratches and the report, which would take 2-3 working days. I said they don't need to, as i have the photos already.

I declined the offer and asked for the phone to be sent back. They offer the realistic price on the website, but then make any excuse to knock the price down. Do not use them.

In relation to your reply - There were no defects. the phone was checked in an EE store and they said it was in perfect condition. My fault for being greedy, and your loss for being scammers.",0

I have contacted them on numerous occasions to be told that they cant log personal complaints, they cant help me with anything and I will just have to wait for the phone to come back in stock.

I have pointed out that it means I am now paying for two sets of insurance for the next month. They dont care, no offer to pause the insurance on the new phone that I dont have.

"On the surface Now TV has it all in terms of content however, it‚Äôs woefully behind with its delivery- the audio is only stereo and the resolution is standard definition unless you pay extra for Boost.

Full HD (1080p and 4K) resolution and 5.1 audio more or less as standard, with many movies and TV series in Dolby Atmos.

What‚Äôs the point of having great content when the pictures and sound quality are so poor? I guess Sly who own Now TV are protecting their premium Sky packages.

I called about this and was told they had no record of this email and I PROBABLY wouldn‚Äôt be charged that so I asked the guy to just cancel the new deal and I would call the next day to sort out the deal again. The guy then proceeded to cut my services off there and then, the phone went dead as we spoke. I called back on my mobile and got a manager who said the guy had in fact cut me off even though I was still in contract for another 6 weeks??? He got me back up and running as I needed the internet as I work from home and he sorted out the new deal, great or so I thought later that evening my internet went down again and the Indian tech guy said, get this ‚Äòthere has been a Wi-Fi blockage and you will just have to give it an hour or so to clear‚Äô I mean really? The next morning was the same and the woman at tech support said she could see my internet had dropped out 112 times in the last few days and I would need a technician but she couldn‚Äôt book one so I would have to wait till lunch time for her supervisor to come in. Well that was enough so I eventually got put through to disconnections and then ended up speaking to the rudest woman ever who said she could sort out a technician but not till 3 days later which I pointed out was no good as I work from home and rely on stable internet. After a while of her telling me that if I cancelled not to expect to be able to get the same deal and various other reasons why I should not cancel she did the discontinuation request but then said I‚Äôd have to sort out cancellation of the O2 contract as it had nothing to do with virgin despite the fact they set it up?? Anyhow I‚Äôm now out of this rubbish service from the end of January and can‚Äôt wait as there wireless internet is despicable and just to cap things off I got a call last night from their customer relations team to reassure me they could sort all of this out and could I give her a brief summary of what had gone wrong, so having gone through the saga with her I was asked what it would take for me to stay to which I replied that if they offered me all of my services free for a year I still wouldn‚Äôt stay!

"Shocking, shocking service! Where do I start.
We are an existing BT customer and decided to upgrade to fibre having had a leaflet though the door about it.

Date was set (22nd December) for installation at 2pm. Openreach turned up at 4.15pm. Didn't want to do it as they said we needed a BT engineer to check (new build house which is rendered and they said they couldn't drill through it or the window frames. Also, they would need to feed a fibre optic cable down an existing pipe). Said they would arrange for a BT engineer to come around.

Subsequently, the appointment was cancelled as was our fibre order. So we were told to order again.

To summarise, the order has now been put in 14 times and each time it is cancelled.

Two weeks ago our (copper) broadband stopped working and despite logging a fault with BT it is still not working. Have spoken to call centres in Liverpool, Paisley and Belfast all to no avail.

I contacted talktalk 9 times now regarding the cancellation of my account, this started in early December to cancel due to moving out the property.
Since then I have called 9 times to check its been cancelled due to no email and bills still coming through

This has caused me so much stress as ive wasted over 9 hours on the phone to these guys and each time they claim they have no record of any cancellation each time even through I have emails from each time I've contacted them asking about my experience.

I've asked for a manager now twice and still no call from them.

My direct debit has been cancelled and there will be call recordings from the 15th of December when i first called to cancel.
MY ACCOUNT IS STILL YET TO BE CANCELLED I DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE WORKERS ARE DOING IN THE OFFICE AFTER SPENDING AN HOUR ON THE PHONE TO ME EACH TIME BUT IT CLEARLY ISNT THERE JOB AND ALL THE PEOPLE NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED.

"if I could I would rate my experience as 0 stars but it wont let me. I'm not sure of the exact date but prior to the 17th February (3 weeks ago) i reported a fault on my washing machine. An engineer called on the 17th and advised that the reported fault was as a result of Teamknowhow engineers replacing the drum on my machine only weeks earlier and cross threading a screw! I was given a date a week later for another engineer to come to rectify the fault. He came on the 24th February and was unable to fix the machine and suggested that the machine would most likely be written off. And so it begins...on the same day as I was told the machine was written off I received a phone call to confirm my e-mail address. As I had heard no more I called on the 26th February just to get an idea of the time scales involved. The person I spoke to advised that i'd receive a voucher by Sunday 28th February. On the 28th I didn't receive a voucher but i did receive a text at 7:05 on a Sunday morning to advise that the voucher would take 72 hours - I assumed form the time the text was sent? The 28th came and went without a voucher as did the 72 hours following my text.I called again to find out what had happened and was advised that the text actually meant 72 'business hours' and that I'd receive it by the close of business that day. Not surprisingly this deadline came and went and I still didn't have a voucher, I still didn't have a working washing machine but I did have a very large pile/piles of washing. When I spoke to someone on the 4th March they were initially going to raise another voucher to be sent to my e-mail but when I was told that would be a further 72 hours I thought this was unacceptable and asked if there was any way to get it quicker. I was then told they could send it via text assuming my phone had internet capability and this would take 24 hours. Again, after 24 hours nothing had arrived and when i called the particularly rude and unhelpful operative advised that 24 hours wasn't a service they offered and that I should have been told 48 hours and again not actually 48 hours but to allow to the end of business ( to ensure the call centre is shut!) I requested to speak to a manger or supervisor as the situation was beyond ridiculous. I was told there was no supervisors?? Having had issues before I knew this to be untrue and asked that a supervisor call me back. I was told that this had been actioned but that I may have to wait up to 3 working days ( not sure how they calculate this but from Friday 5th March i'd expect that someone might call me by Wednesday 10th March if i'm lucky). I then allowed for the 48 hours to pass and called yet again. After being passed through 3 operatives without success I spoke to someone who said he would request the voucher be sent to a different e-mail address as maybe there was a server issue. He told me he couldnt see any reason to cause a delay and that the relevant department did work weekends and that i should get it in the next 24 hours. You'll not be suprised to know that this deadline came and went and still no voucher. When I rang on Monday 8th March, 3 weeks after the fault was reported and my 6th call, I had still not received the voucher. I was now being told yet again that instead of 24 hours this second e-mail would take until close of business 72 hours from Monday 8th (not even 72 hours from when it was requested). I then asked to log another call back for a supervisor as this was beyond a joke. I was told that there was no call back request from Friday and they were unwilling to put in a further request as they were able to resolve my issues. I'm not sure how they think they've resolved this as I still have no washing machine and they apparently have no way of expediting the vouchers. It shows a high degree of arrogance telling me that escalating the call wont help. I asked what i was meant to do with the ever increasing piles of washing that have been building up over the weeks and there was no answer. I was just told to wait until Thursday morning (72 hours from Monday and the end of the working day-not Sunday when i was told the 3rd lot of vouchers were reissued). We are in the middle of a pandemic, its not like I can go to a friend or relatives to get the washing done. Governments advice says don't leave the house unless you have to and don't go into someone elses house.....


What a joke to see the reply below from Ryan!!!! I've made it blatantly clear that I've not received a voucher, I've made it blatantly clear that I have piles of dirty washing and I've made it blatantly clear that TEAM KNOWHOW KNOW NOTHING!!! This response only proves the point further. They are unclearly unable and/or unwilling to help on any other occasion I've had cause to speak to them I don't know why he thinks it would be any different today.",0

I went back to the store - an 8 mile drive and costly parking - 5 times before they phoned EE who explained what was going on to both me and the sales assistant but no one in the store could sort out the locking problem and I was told to take it to an Apple store as Samsung had software problems! I pointed out that I had an iPhone but was repeatedly told of Samsung‚Äôs problems. I tried to persuade them that as I had got the phone from them it was their responsibility but they insisted it was not. Eventually, on December 9th, I drove 20 miles to Reading Apple store who corrected the locking problem in less than 30 seconds with one click to the settings.

"I've been a vodafone customer for around a decade. Their online service has gradually declined over that time. Their website doesn't work properly on any machine I've tried it on, either through my broadband connection or tethered through my phone.
Every page is riddled with apologetic messages saying that something has gone wrong, but something as simple as changing my contract with their site does not work.
To cap it off, I tried to call them but there was no easy access to their phone number - you have to use their digital assistant thing to get the details, and that assistant didn't work.
And yet, the adverts for upgrades load fine, as do the incessant satisfaction surveys.
Sort out your core service! You're a phone company, not a shopping centre!
Vodafone have lost about ¬£500 per year revenue from me because of this, and I suspect this is not isolated based on the other reports.
When you do eventually get through to an agent, they're often very helpful but this process takes on average half an hour or more on the phone.
It wouldn't bother me except that I remember how good they used to be when I joined.
This is a sad decline of a once excellent service.

EDIT:
Oh Vodafone... you want me to chat to you on Facebook or Twitter? Why? Why should I chase you on social media? You have a chat service, and phone staff. Why can these employed staff not do their jobs so that I have to go after you, just to make you provide the service you have charged me for?",0
"This is the third review I have had to write for TalkTalk in the space of just over a month, each time the customer experience has become worse than last, which I never thought possible. This latest incident is, however, the most serious since it now places the health of a 92 year old customer at risk, and yet TalkTalk continue to make excuses and deny that complaints have been logged on their system, despite assurances to the contrary from the staff to whom I have spoken.

After trying to fix a fault on my father's landline for weeks, with no assistance from TalkTalk, this latest incident has occurred today on his discharge from hospital. The Ambulance service who took him home tested his Careline unit as part of their duty of care, only to find that the unit could not connect due to the fault on the line. To make matters worse, this has tied up the line meaning that my father is unable to make and receive calls, something which is very important as our only means of contact with him at present. If this had been a genuine emergency instead of a test of the line then the consequences could have been disastrous.

Since my father's phone line isn't working and he has no internet I have been trying to speak to TalkTalk's technical team for over an hour now, having been cut off 3 times. Each time I am asked the same questions, to which they already know the answer, the most important of which is that a health alarm unit is attached to the phone line (something of which TalkTalk are aware since they confirmed this in an email to my father yesterday).

My experience with TalkTalk has been reported to Ofcom as this cannot be an isolated incident and it is disgraceful that a telecommunications company with a duty of care to its customers can place the health and wellbeing of vulnerable customers at risk simply because it will not take responsibility for faults or respond to customer complaints.

I am only too well aware that there will be a stock response from TalkTalk noting that they are very sorry that this experience hasn't met their high standards (which are a joke) and asking me to provide more information so that they can look into the matter. Other than making them appear to be concerned, this will have absolutely no value as once the information is provided they will yet again lapse into their state of denial, refusing to fix the problem or to follow their own procedures in dealing with the complaints that they so conveniently mislay.

It is about time that the telecoms industry was given a regulator with teeth who could pull the licences from businesses such as this.

UPDATE ON 5 OCTOBER:

An Openreach engineer attended my father's home this morning, and the contrast between the service provided by Openreach and that provided by TalkTalk couldn't be starker. The Openreach engineer was polite and helpful, taking time to identify the fault and replacing what he believed to be the part causing the fault and then verifying that the line was working correctly. Not only did he fix the fault, but he called me to advise me that my father's line was now working, and even took the time to set up the broadband router that we have had no end of difficulties obtaining from TalkTalk.

I stand by my original rating of TalkTalk, particular now it has been demonstrated how a professional telecommunications company (Openreach) can behave. TalkTalk are an absolute disgrace and should have their licence revoked for endangering the welfare of vulnerable customers and lying to try to cover up their failings.",0
"So, it all looks good for the wife's upgrade. Cheaper than Vodafone can offer online or online (can't say about in store - never enough staff to deal with the Customer numbers). Order online (at Carphonewarehouse.com) and receive email saying phone will be delivered next day. Nothing else. No - wait for confirmation of despatch before waiting in all day; No - we'll automatically activate your sim card, so you will lose the use of your existing handset.

So, I wait in all day next day. Email at 4pm to say the phone has been dispatched. Track order with DPD doesn't work (as it hasn't actually been dispatched); still no explanation of SIM activation. Email at 7pm - phone will be delivered next day! Also have the wife emailing - her phone has stopped working. She has no service on her phone. As Carphone Warehouse saw fit to automatically activate the sim on a phone which would not be delivered for another 24hours.

Spend an hour or two before the call centres shut trying to fix (along with making dinner etc). Nothing

Spend 2 hours next morning trying to get it sorted. Vodafone blame Carphone Warehouse for their process (I have to agree its rubbish) and CW say - ""we can't do anything once it's activated"" (even though no-one asked them to activate) ""you'll need to contact Vodafone"".

All of this irritation and annoyance would have been avoided, if Carphone Warehouse had simply managed my expectations in the first place. Their cut off for next day delivery is obviously out of kilter for next day delivery. Their automatic SIM activation is simply wrong. It's not called out anywhere - you have no idea what is happening.

The answer here is that I will not be using Carphone Warehouse ever again. Additionally, I will be looking to move from Vodafone at the earliest opportunity (three mobile numbers and broadband) who despite owning the sim and the service have done nothing but blame CW and tell me to contact CW.",0

Our business has been without smooth broadband or landline for a month and still not resolved despite engineer call outs and emails saying the case has been escalated or resolved.

"Not even a customer yet and already faced issues.
Talk talk sales person came to my door last week & signed me up - verified my details etc via call centre.

1 week later I receive a message from Openreach on behalf of Talktalk, to confirm when they can connect my ""Future Fibre"". This is the first Contact I have on behalf of TT. Nothing in the post or email to confirm anything else up to this point so of course I am concerned already.

In the meantime TT have cancelled my existing Broadband with BT, as well as arranged for Openreach to visit (which I called TT about to confirm as legitimate).

When I call TT to confirm if the message from Openreach is correct they are not able to verify my details. Because they are unable to verify my details - they cannot pass me on to a resolution team. No supervisor / manager able to assist either - all because they were unable to verify my details.

So my question is - if TalkTalk were able to cancel my existing broadband, arrange with Openreach to visit me (via text message), how were they not able to verify my details?

GDPR / Ofcom will receive a severe complaint from me on behalf of this company who clearly are not the ""Future"" of broadband providers.",0

"I have used Currys many times in the past and like with most companies when it goes well all is good. For the first time this year it has not gone well and the after sales care from Currys has been nothing short of disastrous, so much so they will get two separate negative reviews. The first problem I had was that I bought a television online and it arrived with a damaged screen. 'No problem' I thought 'there must be a smooth returns process'. Onto the web i go and find there's a link to a form to fill in.... doesn't work (though that appears to have been fixed in the interim). Oh well it says I can return it to ANY store, there's a form to fill in there as well.... also not working. No problem, I will get on to the webchat. Issues with this:
Chat window gives no indication when a response is made. Given the timescale for replies this is unforgivable.
If you click a link on the page it closes the chat down and you have to start again.
I could not get the email transcript to work at all so I have no record of the conversations had.
Upshot of this was that after spending ages chatting to someone only to lose the chat whilst I tried to check where the local DPD returns location were (by clicking the link on the page) in my second chat I was told repeatedly that I could not return the television.
Stuff this I thought and resolved to take it in to my local store. Getting there they tried to tell me that they could not deal with it as it was an online order (you can return to any store remember) but backed down, perhaps due to my wild staring eyes after an hour spent trying to get the customer support to give me a sensible answer.
Another frustration here is that there is no easy complaints process, just send a letter or vent on a review site.....
I am still ¬£5 down from the delivery cost but I shall consider this money well spent on learning to avoid Currys in future",0

"talktalk always finds ways to steal your money, I have been a customer for many years but recently I decided to change broadband provider. 15 days before the end of the 12 month contract I entered into a contract with a new provider and asked to provide their service from November 3rd, the day of the end of the contract with talktalk. During this period the talktalk team did everything to make me change my mind without success. therefore they knew very well that on day 3 I would no longer be their customer. On the 3rd November I started receiving the Broadband service from my new supplier but at the same day talktalk sent me a bill for the month of November that I absolutely don't have to pay as I am no longer their customers but when I contacted the customer service several times and I had the misfortune to speak with unprofessional , unprepared and liars.

"I am a loyal customer of carphone warehouse Purchased a Pixel 3a at the end of may. After 5 weeks the microphone failed in outgoing calls. I returned the phone to be told that I missed the replacement window by a few days and the technical team would be required to be allowed the opportunity to repair the phone. Completely unhappy with the situation I had to hand the phone over. 10 days later the phone was returned to the shop and on picking the phone up was told that the technical team had cleaned the microphone and it now worked. I also noted that on the screen that the device had a factory reset and software reinstall. I got the phone home and noted that the phone was up to date on the latest Android version, but failed on each attempt to update. I've had the phone back less than a week and the microphone has failed again. This is a brand new phone that is clearly faulty and as such after five weeks should have been replaced. Not fixed.

The handset they sent me was faulty so the call centre advised me to go to my local store to exchange it.

I called the call centre again to be told they could aend me a replacement handset but not in the blue as they have no stock. Only white and freen in stock. My local branch has 400 blue handsets in stock. I don't understand why my handset cannot be exchanged in my local branch as a like for like exchange. This has been an absolute nightmare and very bad experience.

I then went outside and no driver who then updated to say I hadn‚Äôt answered the phone. 30 quid lost, food gone somewhere (they failed to answer where) and chatbot abs useless! How they have not been sued I don‚Äùt know! Literally robbing customers and making up lies!",0
"Customer comes last!
Have 2 appliances from Currys with Knowhow cover, Washing Machine and Tumble dryer. For some reason two appointments had to be made as Hotpoint would take care of washer whilst Knowhow would sort dryer. Needed a door seal on Washing Machine and Dryer making an awful howling noise. This meant 2 days I had to be home and not out at work. The hotpoint guy was Brilliant!!! Knowhow the second day effected most not all of the repair with the machine still noisy after the repair. I called Knowhow who said 'the engineer refuses to come back as he's busy and has other jobs' - long discussion followed which ultimately resulted in another day needing to be spent at home. At no point does knowhow consider the inconvenience to the customer or even seem to care. Knowhow have no authority at all over their engineers. I have cancelled the repair opting to purchase a new dryer. You'd do well to avoid this service. Currys PC World however are usually very good in store.",0

"I was mis-sold a phone contract, the customer service person was rushing the sale and informed me that there was no cancellation fees for the contract I was taking out. Few months later I took out a new contract and requested pac code to be met with a large bill. This was back in November. I've had to request the call logs myself under GDPR, I've made multiple complaints, requested the complaints to be logged and someone get back to me and investigate them and absolutely, NOTHING has been done, I have received a complaint number, been told 3 times now that someone will listen to the call and get back to me. I have never received a phone call from them despite me chasing up very often. I could write even more about this disgusting experience, how every customer service person I've spoken to has had absolutely no interest in helping me, told me that ""complaints logged on the phone do not get a response, you have to do it online in order to get an email back"" I've had to do everything, and still, absolutely nothing has been done on there end. The only people who are able to cancel my illegally sold contract, stuck in two contracts, struggling substantially for money and they could not less care about anything. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!

I work in customer service myself and am absolutely disgusted to see customer service like this exists.",0

"Terrible company, my 89 year old mother was told that there is no such thing as a Landline only phone and that all contracts include Broadband, called customer services numerous times to explain that she does not use broadband and that ¬£43 a month is too expensive, they don't want to listen or help, they just fob you off and keep on taking the money, moved to BT who offer a discount for landline only customers and we have saved ¬£23 per month, Talk talk are not a fair company.",0
"I am fuming. I tried to cancel my broadband. The advisor on the phone said they could not find my account from the post code so I gave them the imei number on the hub. They found my account, he asked me to confirm my address, date of birth and the last four digits of my bank account , which I did, however he then asked me what year and month I joined, because I did not know he would not deal with my call !!!!!!!!! what a absolute JOKE , would you not think that all I had confirmed already was enough.

"AVOID AT ALL COSTS, YOU ARE MAD TO SUBSCRIBE TO NOWTV.
Paid for broadband to be set-up 1st April.
First engineer couldn't do it as there wasn't enough cables. Rang NowTV, told them, they said I have to be home for the engineer to attend and booked another engineer for 11th April. They reassured me he could do the job and said they'd escalate my complaint and I'd hear back in 72 working hours.
11th April, engineer arrived, he again couldn't do it but said I don't need to be home as its external work. I rang NowTV again to complain I've lost 2 days holiday for nothing, they said my original complaint wasn't escalated, it's not their fault put full blame on BT, didn't apologise, said that I have to be home for the engineer so booked again now for the 22nd April.
In this time, they've charged me ¬£20 for the ""service"" and only refunding ¬£5!! Never responded to my email complaints that I've been pushing for 2.5 weeks and actually CLOSED my complaint because they ""hadn't heard"" from me.
Their ""customer service"" is complete and utter trash, I've been hung up on, rudely spoken to, lied to. I've had to delay my uni online from April to JULY cos I didn't have the broadband in time, I've wasted time off work, money in terms of set up and broadband fees plus additional data for my phone. A joke, abysmal and I strongly advise you to GO ELSEWHERE",0

I have contacted you atleast 10 times and you keep emailing me saying you cant give me a refund sooner than another 4weeks! Maybe you need to look into it and contact me rather than making me chase you all the time",0
I sent my daughters phone to this company to be repaired. 1 month now still trying to get a response from this company. They have asked for proof of purchase which seems suspicious to me. I believe they could be possibly taking peoples phones refubing them and selling them on. Just a thought.,0
This company lies in Google stating they have a call line 24/7 it's a lie. They open at 8am. I am paying for a package for 16/18mbps and I am getting 6.2mbps upload no where near the speed I was promised at all. My download is fine but the upload speed is trash. I have written a email with screenshots of this to them let's see their excuse as there really isn't any as we pay for what we ask for not a good start with a new customer is it. If this isn't fixed and made to stay at that speed then after my first payment I will be leaving them and never will I recommend them again or even speak about them again.,0
"Ordered a Christmas Tree on 18/11 that was supposed to be delivered 24/11. Now almost two weeks later we have no Christmas Tree to put up and are ¬£75 out of pocket. Studio use Evri for delivery, how any company can trust Evri with their goods is beyond me - we have had 3 different promised delivery times, each time we receive an email saying ‚Äòwe were unable to delivery your parcel!‚Äô Despite the fact we have a ring doorbell and work from home so are home all day. No attempt has even been made.

Studio customer services team just don‚Äôt seem to care, 7 calls later, no apologies, no promised callbacks (meant to happen within 24 hours, apparently), agents seem to lie just to get you off the phone. One advised us that a complaint had been raised and then the next day another agent said there were no complaints live on our account, obviously just out to fob people off. Refusing refunds despite us not receiving what we ordered. Will likely seek advice from trading standards if a suitable outcome is not reached within the next few days.",0
"Absolutely terrible provider, even when you are a long time customer they do not care, they charge you for being in a country when you are not in the country, just close to the border by a sea.

"I work from home, my internet keeps dropping so I've gone through the process of eliminating issues based on numerous BT tests. From BT's standpoint, the line is fine, 'we're delivering' they say. From my perspective, I can't complete a work call and now we're talking about a loss of earnings. BT cannot provide me with a reliable internet connection but want to charge me ¬£300 to exit my contract early. When I requested for flexibility from a low-level 'lack of customer service' agent in the Loyalty team called Noah, he was incredibly rude, he proceeded to speak over me at every opportunity, infuriating, and said that because my circumstances had changed, that was not his problem. Nice. Imagine in an economic crisis, when everyone's struggling, company's like BT keep throwing the punches. I'm happy to pay an exit fee, a month's bill or ¬£35 would be acceptable, but x10 that amount and considering they can't deliver a service, regardless of what their 'tests' say. BT you're taking the pi55. Juding by the numkber of 1* review on here, perhaps an email to Martin Lewis the people's champion might help. Everything about this situation is wrong. BT you should be ashamed. I felt a bit sorry for Noah, he must hate his job, sad really. Apparently he has logged a complaint on my behalf and I'll receive a call from a manager tomorrow to discuss this further. I'm not holding my breath. Terrible customer service. How the mighty have descended to the gutter.",0
"Dreadful people to deal with. I have now tv bb and use now tv sports passes. Their customer service is beyond appalling. They have only one objective and that is to get your money.

They cannot wait and use every trick in the book to take and keep ¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£. The chat is rubbish and
designed to make you go away.VERY VERY VERY BAD COMPANY.",0
"Ordered their highest broadband package on the 17th.

Got to the install day and the kit hadnt arrived.

Checked email to find two orders had been generated.

Spent 35 minutes on the phone being told they can't find any of the orders.

Tried to reorder on the phone - person couldn't have cared less. Was too busy doing something else, didn't even bother taking notes from the previous person. Wanted me to start all over again. That would be a third contract and credit check? Nah.

Told them to forget it.

If this is how they treat new sales goodness knows how they treat customers.

Just terrible.",0
"I'm not even a customer. I WAS a potential new customer looking to sign up with BT. But I had a question about my landline and my house alarm system. I tried calling BT's helpline many times but they kept me on hold many times. In the end, I decided to use chat: I'll leave you to come to your own conclusion. It reminds me of the Elton John song... The circle of life - or should I say the circle of BT chat.

Bt-chat: Thank you for choosing to chat with us. An agent will be with you shortly.


Bt-chat: You are now chatting with... (I've removed his name)

Bt-Chat: ‚Ä™You are connected to Bt-Chat, how can I help you today?‚Ä¨

Me: Hi. I'm trying to get a basic question answered - but no one is answering your helpline ‚Ä¨- 0800800150 - I've tried 15 times!!

I am currently with Virgin Media. I'd like to switch to BT.

The thing is I have a monitored alarm system and therefore need to keep my landline. That's all I want to know - can I keep my existing landline and how do I go about doing that?

Bt-Chat: ‚Ä™Hi, I am sorry that you have called so many times for the simple answer . Yes you can switch to BT by keeping your landline by calling our BT orders team and they will place the order for you and will share the activation date to you . Also if you want you can keep the same number which you are using for your landline‚Ä¨

Bt-Chat: ‚Ä™Here is the number of the orders team and the number is 0800800150‚Ä¨

Me: I can't get through to anyone on 0800800150 -believe me I've tried. I'm beginning to think if it's this hard to sign up as a new customer - maybe I shouldn't bother.

Bt-Chat: ‚Ä™I am sorry about it and I will surely raise a complaint on this however that is the orders desk number and please call one more time and also you can do the order by visiting our online site.

Bt-Chat: ‚Ä™Also I will escalate the chat to my manager and you can have a word with him‚Ä¨

Me: Ok thanks - You should raise a complaint. Honestly - I'm ready to call it a day with BT. It should be EASY to speak to someone with a basic question

Bt-Chat: ‚Ä™I will certainly. Allow me 2 mins so that I can transfer the chat to my manager‚Ä¨

Me: But when I go online to the BT-deal page and go through to check-out it says we'll be switching you to digital voice - which I assume is not my existing land line?

Bt-Chat: ‚Ä™Let me transfer this to the manager‚Ä¨

BT-Chat-Manager: ‚Ä™Hi, I am the supervisor on the floor. I will be assisting you from here.‚Ä¨
BT-Chat-Manager: ‚Ä™Please allow me 2 mins so that I can check the conversation.‚Ä¨

BT-Chat-Manager: ‚Ä™Thanks for staying connected. I am sorry to see that you are facing issues while placing the order. I would like to suggest you to call our values team and they will be able to share vivid details on your query and will also assist you placing the order with great deals and offers.‚Ä¨

Me: And how do I call your values team?

BT-Chat-Manager: 0800-800-150 or you can follow the link via Landline Deals | Home Phone Packages | BT‚Ä¨

Me: For God's sake!!!! Did you read my earlier message? I already explained that no one answers on that number. I have been on hold for ages.

This is going around in circles. Please - re-read this chat and tell me if it's ridiculous!

I mean - this is so basic what I'm asking, and you've sent me back to the same phone number that I said I can't get through to. For God's sake!

Me: Goodbye

I see that BT replied (below) but you know what.... it's too late. If a potential client wants to ask the most basic questin, but he can't get through using the phone support and the chat support is... well... just pathetic realy - then why should I sign up to BT. Think about BT - lets say I signed up and stayed with you for 5 years - that means your failure to answer the support phone and the pathetic chat support has cost you about ¬£2,400 - go figure.",0
"Received phone as promised, However it was faulty so i used the website to find out how to return it and get a replacement.

"I made an order online for a Huawei p20 Pro on 11/08/2019 and the guy I spoke to was sweet to sell the phone, which is normal.. But when I received the item on 12/08/2019 (the p20 Pro and a free gift of wireless headphones), it wasn't as good as it looked online and I was told I could return it between 14 days of purchase.

So I made a return of both the phone and the free gift on 13/08/2019. And I got a notification on Thursday 15/08/2019 that the parcel was delivered successfully.

So I gave them a ring, to find out if the parcel has been received and the process of cancelling the contract is Underway.. Only for me to speak to the lady and she tells me the phone is being returned back to me. I was surprised, so I asked what she meant by that and she couldn't explain in clear terms, she said the return portal was closed that's why, but she will divert the delivery back to their warehouse for me.

So the lady diverted the delivery back to their warehouse and I got a notification in my email saying the parcel will be delivered on 21/08/2019, it was delivered successfully and signed for by Marriott according to the information on the mail. So I was happy..

Only for me to wake up on Friday morning and see a text message on my phone saying a carphone parcel will be delivered to me on Aug 28, I was so confused. So I rang them and the lady I spoke to checked and said oh the parcel can't be accepted because only the phone was delivered and the wireless earphones were missing, so the parcel is getting sent back to me.

And I was like what do you mean, I packed this two items together the same way you sent them to me, and the funny thing is the headphones are packed in a big box, so she saying I should check it when the parcel arrives was totally awful, no empathy whatsoever and no sense to what she said.. How do I check for something when you can't find it..

So I kept pressing the lady and then she finally said okay she would open up an investigation for me with dpd.. So I did and I was able to report the issue, I'm currently waiting for feedback from the investigation.

But if you'll ask me, I would never recommend carphone warehouse to anyone ever.. They've just lost one valid customer.. It's horrible with carphone warehouse when a problem arises.

I wanted to give a 0 star but can't seem to be able to do so.",0
"Wow. First time customer. Coverage checker said excellent 4g. Took out a mifi contract with another sim. Installed them to find very poor signal outdoors and no signal indoors. Less than 7mps and this is West London.

Call 2: 15 minutes later agent says she is not the right team to process this. Transfer to someone else. 15 minutes later and call ended
Call 3: Next day. System is not working. Call back later.

When I am finally able to get you to do your job , I will be delighted to have been a customer for 3 days and no more.

I placed an order with Morrisons (Deliveroo Hop) which contained 3 bags of goods. However, the driver delivered only 2 bags and marked the order as completed.

"Don't even think about buying a 'sim free' phone from these scamsters.

1) If you buy in store, you will never get a refund out of them
2) If you manage to convince them to let you exchange (something they already claim you can't do!), then here are the rules:
* The phone has to be of equal or higher value than the original
* You cannot choose two phones to make up the value
* You cannot choose a phone and an accessory to make up the value
* You cannot get a 'gift card' to the same amount to buy a phone at a later date

When trying to get anywhere, they will redirect you to 'customer services'. They in turn will tell you to 'talk to the store'. In particular, Dickyala at the New Malden branch - who put his grubby fingers all over the phone, performed diagnostics on it, and then completely denied doing so after the fact. He even refused to clean it because I was ""being rude"". He made several snide comments and was all together unhelpful.

Further, 'Jamie' (employee ID 130) in your call centre - clearly operating out of South Africa - had no idea about the actual policies.

Tell me - why is NOBODY aware of the policies on your website?

So ultimately, if for any reason you have to return a BRAND NEW phone, you are totally out of luck. They will only try and get more money out of you and put you in the same position.

You could've just offered me store credit, or a refund and all would've been fine. But you try and enforce these restrictive policies for utterly no reason whatsoever. No wonder you're having to shut branches all over the place - you're useless.

They have certainly lost a customer for life.",0

"We purchased a stainless steel range cooker in the summer (June this year). We were supplied with the correct (stainless steel) cooker, but with the wrong/black colour plinth!

We've spoken to Marks Electrical and emailed them, supplying pictures of what was received. Marks Electrical reached out to the manufacturer, Stove, who sent us exactly the same/wrong part, twice! The cooker description and pictures on their website are still the same as when we first bought the cooker, it has no description/pictures of the black plinth but stainless steel plinth.

We've spoken so far to 5 individuals. Every time that we spoke to new agent, they apologized for the delay in resolving and promised they will take ownership, only to never hear from them again!

We informed Marks Electrical and wrote a number of emails to their customer services team, complaining and asking to resolve or provide a refund due to being mis-sold. They've now stopped responding to us altogether and ignoring our emails.

Can I just say, you‚Äôve only (4 months after bringing to your attention) just managed to get to the bottom of why we were sent the wrong colour. The conclusion (which by the way, was received as news by the whole team) doesn‚Äôt make the issue magically disappear! We still have to live with the wrong item for as long as the cooker lasts. If no refund is awarded due to the cooker being used (although, what are we expected to do? How many keep a spare cooker in their home). Mark Electrical are yet to recognise mis-selling (the wrong pictures and description are still live on the website!) and reasonably resolve the issue. Compensating and giving partial refund may have made difference.

I can‚Äôt resist, but include statement provided by the respective Sales Advisor (Samuel Beach), who‚Äôs proposal was that we ‚Äúpurchase another cooker (after spending ¬£2200+!) for which we be given some discount‚Äù to make up! If this isn‚Äôt a joke, what is?",0
Ordered an iPod as a Christmas present from here. Received a dispatched email on the 28th Nov. iPod still hasn‚Äôt turned up. Hasn‚Äôt even been collected by Royal Mail yet. They either take days to reply or ignore you completely. They keep blaming the Royal Mail strikes but can‚Äôt imagine nothing has been collected from them for 2 weeks now. Every time time I‚Äôve emailed they keep fobbing me off telling me to wait 2 weeks and THEN they will investigate. Also refusing to refund me because it‚Äôs apparently with their delivery team. Absolute joke.,0
"I've been phoning up continuously for the last couple of weeks and seem to be going round in circles as no one understand the meaning of me wanting to change my payment date until 29th of every month, then trying to take money early, and promising to phone me back, quick to take my money but not as quick to help me with my situation, everytime they've tried taking direct debit when not stating any clear dates untill I'm phoning back again giving me bank charges, really not a happy customer can't wait to leave this service and contiue with my custom else where ASAP, would not recommend anyone join as by everyone seems to be having a lot of the same issues

Bought a pixel6pro from carphone wharehouse online on 28Oct2021. There was a duplicate transaction which i told them about that day. I called them twice more and it is now 17th Nov2021 and still no refund of the duplicate transaction.,0
their site does not work on any browser(chrome/chromium/firefox). be it on mobile or on laptop/desktop. all the time comes with error with popup wait or exit the page. not sure what their developers are doing do they not even monitor it,0
I was tricked into entering a 24 month contract by one of their agents. They will not give me a copy of the contract or a transcript of the conversation with the agent. I am now stuck with a terrible provider. They have not offered me any reduction in my cancellation fees in spite of me not even realising I was on a contract. Do not go for this company. Their customer service is horrendous. They also charge you to use your phone abroad - even in France - ¬£2 per day.,0
"Worst company I‚Äôve ever had the misfortune of dealing with. Order a cooker hood in silver. Was sent a cooker hood with black chimney, was then told I should have checked contents and was told if the box was opened I can‚Äôt return. I‚Äôve now had to buy a silver chimney hood from elsewhere to make it look like what I was supposed to get

The images on the marks electrical page for the cooker hood is clearly showing a silver hood. I‚Äôve sent images to show this along with a link to the page. I‚Äôve asked for a refund for the additional parts I‚Äôve had to buy to make this right as they wouldn‚Äôt refund me. I‚Äôve currently had to wait on hold for 40 mins plus every time I‚Äôve called which has been 5-6 times now. Spoke to multiple customer service advisors pretending to be a manager. Have waiting on 3 separate occasions for a manager call back which never happens. An absolute joke to be honest. Still not resolved. My advice would be, but somewhere else if you want what you‚Äôve ordered",0
been with this company 12 years and they are so bad in the billing dept been cut off when actually paid twice with no warning price goes up the more loyal and tie you to contracts .enough is enough!,0
"Vodafone has been experiencing technical issues in our area since the 22nd of December 2022.
They have done absolutely nothing to sort this issue out almost 3 weeks later ?
My partner and I rely heavily on the wifi and 5g as we both work from home.
It‚Äôs just really absurd that we still expected to pay our monthly bill even though they have done nothing to meet us half way !

So disappointed once our contract is up I will not be using them and I will be changing our phone numbers to another network",0
"I chose now broadband when I moved into my house. They couldn‚Äôt connect me straight away due to one of the lines outside not being maintained (??) and I ended up using a lot of data since I WFH But they only ‚Äúrefunded‚Äù the days the service was down for. Since then the broadband randomly cuts out - it was getting more frequent and in 3 weeks I‚Äôve had 2 engineers round and multiple calls with the company. Their customer service is horrendous, they clearly don‚Äôt communicate with openreach, goodwill gesture was shocking and no offer to cover the amount I paid for extra data. Was told they have to do ‚Äútrial and error‚Äù to get the broadband working and tried to push back on my escalation of the matter. AVOID AVOID AVOID.",0
"Bought ¬£250 AirPods and when I opened the package the box was empty.

"Awful awful company send you food late when it‚Äôs cold offer you no refund . Even with missing items, will never ever use again. Oh and customer service agents are robots no compassion no help nothing",0
"I bought a very expensive item from Ebuyer. ¬£1949 to be exact. A considered purchase indeed. If you just want the conclusion to this awful experience then I will state it for you . Only shop with ebuyer if you like to be left confused, in the dark, and have your consumer rights infringed upon.

I bought a very expensive graphics card from ebuyer. They shipped it out quick. Nice. What's not so nice is that the card was faulty. OK so that's disappointing but not ebuyer's fault. No problem, I will RMA it and get a replacement. I start the process and need to call in. They agree, yes send it in it seems faulty.

They receive the card. They agree its faulty. OK so far so good. I am offered a replacement or refund. I ask for a replacement. OK they say.

Then nothing happens, so I wait few days, a few days more. I start to worry about my nearly ¬£2000. I email them and they say item is out of stock. Would I like refund or alternative item. I determine that I should just ask for a refund, and source the item from elsewhere. So that's what I do. I ask for a refund, I am told by ebuyer that my refund is processing.

I source the item I want from elsewhere. Thinking my refund is on its way, y'know to have some hope of balancing the books.

Then guess what happens? NOTHING. So I wait few days, a few days more. I start to worry again about my nearly ¬£2000. I email ebuyer all politely, I would be most grateful if you could update me on the status of my refund...

At this point they tell me that I am not entitled to a refund due to the age of the product....er, sorry what?

I had the card for a week. It was faulty. I highlighted this and returned it promptly.They agreed it was faulty. I asked for a refund. Am I being thick? consumer rights exist, don't they?

So no, apparently. Ebuyer wants to do things their own way. They apparently think its perfectly fine to disregard my right to reject faulty goods and ask for a refund within 30 days, which contradicts law and their own stated returns policy.

They have insisted on shipping a replacement item, now it's back in stock, despite the fact that this is against my wishes and leaves ¬£1949 deficit in my finances.

I have had to force the communication and action process from start to finish so far. Ebuyer customer service is passive and will not action my requests or respond to me without several days delay and prompting from me.

I have been left confused, upset, seriously out of pocket and lumped with an item I have no use for. Ebuyer have acted against my wishes and contradicted themselves and established fact.

So, in summary, only shop at ebuyer if you don't care about your money (in 2022!), and don't want your basic rights respected. Then if something goes wrong, you can enjoy being ignored for days on end until ebuyer gives you an outcome that infringes your rights and leaves you with serious feeling of 'I should have gone to overclocker'.

Seriously though - AVOID AT ALL COST for any purchase above trivial.",0

"A couple of weeks before the scheduled engineer date we received a text saying there was a delay, and they'd follow up about a few days after that with more information.

A few days pass, and we just get a text saying our account had been cancelled, no information given (We hadn't cancelled it). Upon calling customer service we were told that there was no space in the Openreach cabinet for NowTV customers (which they should be tracking themselves - they should know how many customers they have in that cabinet, and their site should be checking against that).

We were relying on NowTV as part of a house move so we could continue working from home and are now left in the lurch, having to chase up customer service and use achingly slow mobile data to work on while frantically trying to find another provider that won't lie to us about broadband availability.

Now were happy to quote fibre optic speeds for our broadband, despite the fact their cabinet was full for our area (unknown to us). Be very careful if you have any urgent need for broadband e.g. lining up changeover from another provider.",0

"M8390265

I was given a quote for ¬£290.00 for iPhone 11 256GB. It was in mint condition and sent in the original box.
Once they received it they observed the iPhone and said the iPhone had more than 5 scratches. Which was complete nonsense. When I disputed this is what they had to say.

'Apple iPhone 11 256GB Unlocked Your device has multiple scratches on the casing (we allow up to 5). These cosmetic imperfections mean your device has been repriced. Apple iPhone 11 256GB Unlocked Your device has multiple scratches on the display (we allow up to 3). These cosmetic imperfections mean your device has been repriced. Apple iPhone 11 256GB Unlocked - Your screen has marks that create bright spots on the display, this can be caused by small amounts of moisture over a period of time - often these are only obvious on a white background, however, the screen will need to be replaced.'

I was furious. I requested for the phone to be sent back to me. Then received another email saying.

'I noticed that you had recently rejected our revised offer of ¬£100 for your device. good news, we have reassessed your device and taking into consideration the condition we can offer ¬£145 for your device.'

WHAT COMPLETE NONSENSE.

I rejected the offer and received the phone back after 10 days and it was received not in the original box.

It was sold on eBay for ¬£345.00.

Terrible service. I went to upgrade from basic to fibre 3 days ago as since has no service at all.

I asked about the ¬£10 code... they said I'd already used it .... They got the order wrong, technically I used the code, but I didn't get the correct order I had to reorder at full price. I complained by email to deliveroo, and got a standard reply saying I'd already used the ¬£10 voucher, I replied asking if anyone actually reads the emails sent to them (I was not rude), and got a reply saying they would look into it. Today I've received an email saying that because I've complained and repeatedly asked for financial compensation (not true) they are suspending my account.

"Absolutely terrible experience with this company.

I decided to trade in my iPhone 8 as I recently got a newer phone. I had no reason not to trust Carphone Warehouse and the process seemed simple enough (if only!). I wish I had read the reviews on here first because it‚Äôs quite clear there is something very suspicious going on with their trade-in service.

I applied online and was quoted ¬£260 for my phone, which was in perfect condition. I was sent an envelope to put it and checked online for what steps to take next (as there weren‚Äôt any instructions included in the envelope). I wrapped my phone up in another layer of bubble wrap to keep it safe and took it to the post office to ensure I got proof of posting.

Around a week later I received an email telling me that my phone is classed as ‚Äúnon working‚Äù due to ‚Äúscreen cracked‚Äù and is now only worth ¬£80. As you can imagine I was very surprised and replied asking for a photograph of the damage. I received an automated reply the next day telling me someone would get back to me in 48hrs. I also phoned their customer helpline hoping to get a bit more information but after being on hold for over 30 minutes I was told that there was nothing they could do. They agreed to raise my case and told me I‚Äôd hear from them within 3-5 working days.

TWELVE working days later (so not even including weekends) I received a brief email with an attached picture of what was allegedly my phone - with a very small crack/chip to the side underneath the screen. I have sent over a picture of my perfect condition phone that I took before I sent it to CPW and have asked them to send it back to me. I am absolutely devastated as the money was greatly needed at this time of year and I could have sold it privately with much less hassle.

All I know at this point is my phone was damaged either accidentally or purposefully while it has been in the possession of CPW. Judging by some of the other reviews on here this seems to be a bit of a scam they‚Äôve got going on. I‚Äôve told everyone I know to NEVER use this service no matter how simple it might seem.

**edit - despite the response received below (calling me by the wrong name) and me sending them the required details, I have still heard nothing. I don‚Äôt know if the response is genuine or just a method to appear as though they are addressing the numerous complaints.**",0
"Absolutely, poor service and scammers. I took insurance for my daughters iPhone for 24 months that cost me ¬£11.99 for 24 months = ¬£287.76, I called up to make a claim it cost me an excess fee of ¬£50.00 total in cost ¬£337.76 for a refurbished phone, putting into account Iphones devalue after 24 months. I think it is a waste of money taking cover with Team know-how. D&G is the best insurance, you do not have to pay for replaced, you only pay excess for the upgraded version. Please do not waste your money on insurance save it and buy a new one or pay to repair it will be cheaper.",0

I've been a customer for over 20 years and my account was due for renewal so I phoned BT. I was told that could give me speeds of over 150mbs.

I looked at this which didn't have over 100mbs so hence I did not take this as I wanted full fibre over 150mbs. So I did not get my nhs discount as I had to take my broadband through bt app also bt is most reliable in my area so really not much of a choice if I want reliable broadband also very expensive not happy customer hopefully in 2yrs time when I can renew that the other companies have the same reliable broadband connection so I don't pay through the nose again.",0

"Here's another 1 star review for Team Knowhow. Having read all the previous negative reviews (because that's what 1 star reviews are) I feel a bit sorry for Ryan/Ben, must be awful working for such a terrible company.
So, we had an insurance policy for a fridge freezer that was written off and a replacement voucher issued by text message, all good so far, however, I lost my phone before I could use the code (my fault I admit). My wife contacted Knowhow to ask if the code could be re-issued and finally got a reply a couple of months later asking for more info, she forwarded the email to me and I replied on 28/11 and to date have still to receive a response. Due to this I contacted them on Twitter and, to be fair received a response quite quickly asking me to DM them the details which I did the same day 08/12 giving them the information they asked for. They DM'd me again on 09/12 to ask for further information, which, again, I replied the same day. Since then I have had no further contact despite a further tweet and 2 further DM's. So tonight I tried to submit a complaint using their web complaints form, however, once completing the form and submitting it I got a bounce back saying there was a glitch and I should try re-submitting it, I did this but got the same bounce back and suggesting that an alternative method was to phone them, great I thought, I'll try that. So I phoned and after going through all the options the recorded message came back that the phone lines were closed, why could this not be stated before going through all the options, could have saved me some time. Anyway Ryan/Ben, my agreement number is: BBTL2X5P
DD NO: 5000528557
Make and model: LG ELCTRNC GR359SQ.
I would suggest that when Ryan/Ben (or whoever is taking their turn this week) asks you to contact them through social media that everyone takes this with the proverbial pinch of salt, I don't think they care how you contact them, they are just as obstructive across all methods of contact.",0

It turned out to be the glass cover for the bulb. Unbeknown to me It had sheared leaving glass in the holder and a major lump in the oven. On placing my hand in the oven I received a cut to my index finger which was deep and needed hospital treatment which incurred petrol charges plus parking. After several emails back and forth to thier insurance company has deemed it My Fault even though we supplied photos of cuts and the broken glass.

Purchased a phone from here in APRIL never received it. Complained immediately after and was told I‚Äôd get a refund AND I STILL HAVENT literally 3MONTHS later. Actual scam.",0
Twice I brought a product and it was broken and beyond use! I thought these thing were meant to be tested before being sent! Spent over ¬£100 thus far trying to get something that actually worked,0
"Absolutely disgusting customer service, since Novmber I've been fobbed off, after retuning 2 items and only received the credit for 1, even with proof of return still no credit and everytime I get told its being passed to the relevant department, quick to close my complaint down but still no resolution!!!!
The reply is an absolute joke, recently been in touch.... constantly been in touch with no result this has been going since the beginning of November, and all I get is the same as you have put in your reply, but the staff don't understand you and are reading off a script. How about just actually sorting this out??? you have my proof of return and tracking shows you received my return. Where's my refund ?????",0
Order placed on 7-12 and still not received on 30th. Customer service non existent practically,0
"I moved from Talk to Talk to go to BT, we depend on our broadband connection for not just our IT facilities, but also our VOIP phone system.

It has taken over two months to get connected, BT has made a total ball-up of our order. We finally got an email yesterday to say we were up and running, hip hip hooray. After spending the whole day trying to get connected, we are now being told that there is a fault on the line. A brand new line that we have waited over 2 months, going on for three months. I fully realised as one person we will not be heard, but I'm taking my time to write this message because to be quite frank, our national telephone company seems to have no regard for their customers, and I totally regret leaving Talk, Talk, who incidentally we never had any trouble with. So much for following our IT departments advice to move to BT, totally disgusted with teh service of BT. Absolutely useless. I would not recommend them to anybody.",0
Only given 1 star as no option to give no star. Watch out. Turns out a months pass is for life. not just for Christmas!! It auto renews...... And trying to get money back........Officially th worst company I hav come across for a long long time. - look at the reviews a company going backwards,0
"So unhappy with my experience. The laptop I ordered crashed 4 times within the first day of receiving, the battery light also didn't operate property and I lost faith in the company quite quickly.
PC Specialist then sent a courier, refusing to then refund the courier charges as they could 'find no fault' with the laptop, despite me having video evidence of the laptop crashing.
Would never use them again, total waste of time and money.",0
"Still waiting for the ordered Part to arrive.... chased after 10days,
Blame Royal Mail if you like but I'm your customer!!

Still no part and no response from Espares!!!

This doesn't feel like good customer service.",0
After being a customer for many years I recently started a new policy as I moved house and added a fridge freezer which I inherited with the property and wasn‚Äôt working. An engineer came and told me about the repair it would need saying D&G would be in touch. After not hearing anything for a couple of days I checked on my account to discover all appliance plans have now been cancelled without any explanation. I have now been left without a fridge or freezer for nearly a week. I am extremely dissatisfied with the customer service. I have been a customer for over 10 years and I don‚Äôt think I have ever needed to call on you. All the money you have received from me over the years and then get nothing in return when you are needed.,0
Went into the Loughborough store this morning with the purpose of buying a new tv. Wanted some advice about the different screen types ... OLED Ultra 4 uk ect .... was locking to spend about a grand on the right one for us ........ Sadly we were there for a good twenty minutes but no-one came to help us even though we waited for a gentleman to finish with a lady on one of the in store till stations. He saw us waiting BUT as soon as he finished with the lady he disappeared out the back without saying a word to us. Sorry Currys but in the end we walked out of the store with no-one asking us if they could help so it looks like we will have to go and spend our money elsewhere .,0

Also, contract came with offer of hearing device, which never arrived!",0

"This company is the worst most dishonest people I have come across in business, I am not sure what their excuses will be once Covid restrictions are gone, they seem to blame everything on Covid, I even think their bank had Covid 19 as it could not refund money several months!! The product order rarely arrives and the bank is just too ill to refund your money, please do not trust this company with your very hard earned cash, you will be left very disappointed",0
"Shocking company. Shocking trading standards and non existent customer care. Personal experience too long and exhausting to write down but in a nutshell, they wouldn‚Äôt honour a deal they was advertising. Then lost my original credit check and tried to do another one! Never again.",0
"The worst experience. Having been without a phone for over 100 days they have now cut me off. The customer service operators are rude, incompetant and try to fob you off at every opportunity. Can't wait to sever my contract and leave this shithouse of a company behind. DO NOT SIGN UP WITH THEM.",0
Very poor service and absolutely useless costumer service avoid at all cost,0
"I ordered four personalised mugs for work almost a month ago now, I got one duplicate, one missing and one with the writing cut off. I contacted customer service who agreed to send two replacements, one arrived with the exact same problem. I contacted them again and they said they‚Äôd send a replacement mug again, it‚Äôs been a week now and still no replacement! I had to reschedule our meal twice and now it‚Äôs too late to give the gifts!! And I can‚Äôt contact customer service because the awful app logged me out and won‚Äôt sign me back in. Never again will I order from optimal print, my advice is find another option. This is definitely not worth the hassle!!!
My order number was 22395656",0
"Do not buy anything from this company

1) they advertise phones that they dint even have in stock to sell .

3) Refund time of 14 working days passes and then they advise you t will take a further 45 days to refund you .",0
"Be aware! started the App and Sky Sports started without being chosen. I was then instantly billed ¬£33.99 for using, when speaking to customer service there is no way of this happening I apparently have physically started the subscription (Rubbish!!). They then tried to get me to agree to credit, I ask for a refund on my card then that chat ""timed out"". Through e-mail I was issued a prompt refund.",0
"Awful customer service!!! No one answers the phoneline, Cant book repair over the phone and cant get through online. online comes back with an Error500 code. What a waste of money! Expect to be able to book a repair straight away :( Not happy. Will never use or recommend this company ever again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"Ordered broadband for the 13th of december. Didnt on that day, waited for the next day still didnt work. Called BT they scheduled egineer, he didnt show up. I had left work early, lost my weekly bonus,regular wages and he didnt even show up. Called again scheduled another visit DIDNT SHOW UP AGAIN. Third time I called and thats when they finally showed up, had to leave work early 3 times and even then they couldnt fix the problem. They scheduled another appointment 4th time and they DIDNT SHOW UP AGAIN. What is wrong with this company wasting people's time and money absolutely ridiculous. Now its been 11 days and my broad band doesnt work next appointment is on 30th so that will be 17 day without the internet. Ludicrous stay clear of BT dont buy their services because if you have a problem good luck getting it fixed


Edit: looks like BT wants me to write on community forums, but what will that even do people there aren't BT employees just members of community.",0
"Absolutely awful company. I had a free trial for 3 months of now tv after receiving a pass in a Mcdonals order. With out any warning they continue to charge you ¬£9/month and then when I asked for a refund the only way you can talk to them is through a live chat online. Theres no helpline which makes it impossible to resolve any issues. Now Tv is a complete scam and an awfully set up company, do not trust them.",0
"I went through the process of selling my immaculate iPhone. They agreed a price and on receipt of the phone they claimed it wasn‚Äôt in pristine condition.
They therefore offered a much lower price, which I could accept or else they could return it.
I chose to have it returned and sold my phone on MusicMagpie instead and they didn‚Äôt make any such revisions.
Lesson: don‚Äôt waste your time, go straight to MusicMagpie.",0
"This company is pure evil.

They continue to set up new direct debits after you cancel; I have had to file disputes with the bank multiple times.

There is zero customer support when contacting them.

Everything about this ridiculous company is designed to confuse, obfuscate and make simple processes difficult.

Avoid like COVID. Read the reviews here for evidence that most people have nothing but absolute hate for this company.

Pure, unadulterated scum. May this company rot and burn. I hope they go bankrupt during the cost of living crisis.

They are a malignant cancer.",0

"If there was an option to put 0 stars that would be my choice. Terrible experience with NowTV.
If you are thinking of joining perhaps you should read the comments first, wish I did! Long story short I signed up for the 'free 30 day trial' which I cancelled long before the 30 days were up, unknown to me they kept taking money from my bank account for a further 6 months before I noticed. After discussions back and forth they refused to give me back my money. Thats stealing! They were rude and didnt care its all about the money for them. Dont give your card details to these thieves. Trading standards are being informed.",0
Awful customer service. Was promised one deal and had it activated. Three weeks later. Still no broadband. Rang up three individual times and on the third they told me they would no longer be honouring it even though it was their mistake.,0
"I find it hard to describe how bad Vodafone are. I have had 2 months of continual hassle with them and have spent, literally, hours on the phone, most of it on hold.
My broadband went down yet again tonight, I went on live chat, after 15 mins I passed security. At minute 25 they said they can't help, call back in the morning. This is the new super broadband with supposed booster and back up. I've logged onto my neighbours ""sky"" account (with their permission) to complete my online work. Equipment going back to VF tomorrow, I've had enough. They are absolutely woeful.",0
I‚Äôm still waiting on customer service getting back to me. Since I never received my delivery.,0
30 min wait to speak to customer services to enquire why a refund had not been issued within 14 days. I was told there were still 3 more processes to go through before I could receive a refund!!,0

"The worst company i have come across! Brought a tv back in jan and then broke a few months later, they couldnt repair it so sent me a voucher. I refused the voucher and sent it back as wanted my money back to shop elsewhere. Still to this day i have not been refunded and its been 2 months now. I am in the process of starting court proceedings against this company, avoid avoid avoid",0
"Our broadband service has been down for 17 days . I reported it on day one and was told it would be fixed remotely .Eventually after 2 weeks an engineer is trying to resolve..why couldnt BT arrange this when I first reported a fault ?
No apology from BT. I am spending hours every day trying to speak to someone to get it resolved . No one at BT customer service cares about the customer experience . Truly awful service ,yet they are still billing me for a service they are not providing. Zero stars",0
"Awful company. I knew this before I even got a contract with them. My house is a new build and only BT support with internet so I had no choice. I had a 24 month contract with them from August 2019 and never missed a payment until earlier this year due to COVID reasons, they said it‚Äôs fine just pay one month and we‚Äôll give you one month free. I paid and they never gave me a month free. Went to disconnect my services for ‚Äúnot paying‚Äù I phone up, they said they can‚Äôt do nothing as I hadn‚Äôt paid in time, phoned up again and they said ‚Äúno worries we‚Äôve stopped the cancellation and your services will remain active‚Äù and they did for 7 days and they just deleted my account. I phone up, they said ‚Äúit‚Äôs gonna take 2 weeks to get it activated again‚Äù. So I had to get a new account made, I was forced into another 24 month contract and all the advisor could do was sell me more things that I didn‚Äôt want! I raised a complaint and had it escalated to the manager FIVE DAYS AGO. I was supposed to get a call-back the following day from the manager. It‚Äôs been nearly a WEEK and the manager hasn‚Äôt called me. I‚Äôve phone them every day since the complaint and the advisors have told me ‚Äúthe manager seems to be avoiding your complaint as it‚Äôs top of the queue‚Äù. They‚Äôve sent me a 4G mini hub in the mean time and now they‚Äôve disconnected that too! I pay ¬£64 a month for my BT package of ‚Äúaverage 900mbps download and 450mbps guarantee‚Äù my speeds have never gone above 300mbps, absolute SCAM! Avoid and go with Virgin Media.",0

"Ordered a ¬£73 take away at 17.12, watched the delivery prediction slide from 18.25 all the way up to 20.05 even though the pick up was supposedly 17.49. Finally cancelled the order. I had taken screen shots of the whole process so the argumentative guy in the chat (Kareem) eventually cancelled and refunded even though he had originally said he couldn‚Äôt. Appalling company. Appalling service. Utterly useless and unreliable. Just don‚Äôt use them. Ever.",0
"Don‚Äôt have warranty from them! I brought an Apple Watch as a gift from November 2021, I had included extra warranty for a year incase of damages. Curry‚Äôs would take the money out of my account each month, then in October I received a letter to say they couldn‚Äôt take the money out of my account (don‚Äôt know why as there was money in my account) and that I only have the two more payments until it comes to an end. I sent back the letter with bank details to take the last to payments out. It is now January 2023 and curry‚Äôs is still taking money from my account. I‚Äôve spoken to someone on the live chat they gave me a number that nobody seems to answer. I‚Äôve had to cancel the direct debit but I would still like my money back for the two months.",0
If there was a no star option I would use that. Ordered and paid for I phone 8 plus on 27th September. Received an email saying it would be sent within 5-10 working days. Many empty promises broken. QFM featured this week on BBC One show as a dodgy outfit. My promised refund has yet to materialise. I have started the charge back with my credit card provider.,0
"Delivery was scheduled for 8.45 to 12.45. Never turned up, and now apparently has been cancelled. I never had a call to tell me this - after many calls to Currys (and being assured I was the next delivery), they said the driver ran out of hours, and I have to call again tomorrow to arrange a new date (and go through the interminable auto-options process yet again!)

Overall, the most appaling customer service!",0
It‚Äôs difficult to contact them by phone and the advice given over the phone is inconsistent to say the least. Our family of 5 with 3 small kids waited 2 weeks with the customer reps one cancelling the others advice and in the end coming back with - the standard terms are 2 weeks. Good thing we contacted them and other cs reps informed us 24hrs earlier that repairs will take max 48hrs‚Ä¶ then I got 2 surveys a day to ask us how they did. This was one of the last ones AFTER I filled out 2 customer ‚Äúsatisfaction‚Äù surveys for them‚Ä¶,0
"Extremely disappointed with the quality of my order. Colour on the print is poor, the cards have been cut badly leaving rough 'fraying' edges on one side, some cards have varying coloured marks around the edges. Paper quality is supposed to be 350gram but is not comparable to any other card I have ever purchased with 350gram weight. Not worth the money and to top it off customer service is poor - only accessible through a chat bot which drops out and following two attempts to contact them have not had any appropriate response.

Update - optimal print have now issued a full refund for my order.",0
My wifi and television not working from the last one and half months and no one can solve this issue. I am very fed up with virgin media so I want earlier disconnection but they are going to charge earliest disconnection fees and I talk with one of virgin media team member her name is Grace she refuse to give me any solution about it and told me I am going to disconnect this call if you asking me for this refund which you paid but you haven‚Äôt got the services. So I am suggest you do not use virgin media.,0
"TV was delivered to a completely different address. It took ages to convince Argos that we never did receive it. Finally a friendly neighbour told us that the tv had been literally dumped in their driveway (several hundred yards away from our house). Argos were apologetic and promised a ¬£25 refund for our trouble - I got an email saying they'd processed our refund but we never did get it. When I called to follow up I was told that they had decided not to give us the refund after all because we had officially 'received' the tv! I was upset and angry that they hadn't even bothered to tell me this (I only found out because I'd called to follow up) so they hung up on me. Second person I talked to (to complain about the hanging up experience) was very apologetic and promised a refund would be issued, but I'm not sure what to believe at this point. I do not recommend shopping at Argos online - the trouble we have gone to over this far outweigh the benefits of a cheaper deal.",0
"Sometimes companies are of a time,. Grabbing the zeitgeist and understanding the psych of their customers...

Now.. Is not that.

Now is one of the most expensive streaming services.

It has the worst Content IMHO

They charge you extra to not have content in standard def ( nb literally no one has a standard def telly.)

Their platform is slow and unintuitive.

And now....

And.now after all that they are putting adverts on the programs they are charging you to watch... That is unbelievable isn't it.... Its just like a car manufacturer who is not selling any cars doubling the price to try and sell more.

Let me help... You don't get more customers by raising prices and having a much worse service.

You may as well watch All4 they have more content, better shows, yes they have adverts... But there service is Free!

This latest change leaves Now destined for the dustbin and to fair that's where it belongs.",0
Absolutely disgraceful. I was told 2 weeks in advance that someone would be out to replace my hob on the 4th of June. I since had a text days prior saying it would be between 13:10 and 17:10. At 17:40 i phoned the helpline and i was told my visit had been cancelled but no one had told me. So my wife took a day off work unpaid for this. Disgusting. Curry's and teamknowhow are an absolute disgrace and i will never deal with them again or recommend anyone else. Disgraceful behaviour and i am expecting a full refund and more. Shocking serive. Would not recommend,0

Got fobbed off 4 times via webchat who said an email would be sent in next 48 hrs. 5th time (Shivam) refused to help at all and told me to call despite me repeatedly saying i had a speech disability.

The premises is now left vulnerable to burglary. Police called on premises this morning to report an attempted Burglary by concerned neighbours into my premises

"Shame I could give less than a 1 star review! October agrees a new 2 year deal, this took 3 calls due to the incorrect details being processed to be told on the last call I didn't have to increase the price/broadband package. 6months on after cpi notice I had been charged twice for the last 6 months for bt sport and HD package totalling ¬£120 over this period on the phone Last month for over an hour to be told all fixed and the credits applied for the over charging.

"Wish I had seen this earlier. NYE ordered almost ¬£50 worth of food. It was not delivered. I supplied call logs showing I tried calling the restaurant multiple times (number did not connect) and then was on with their chat people at like 4:30am to log it, somewhat ruining what had otherwise been a great night. They also admitted in the chat they couldn't get through and would revert. I had to chase days later and they are claiming the restaurant say the food was delivered and refuse to refund any money. Deliveroo are scam artists. I will be cancelling my plus subscription and using another app. Appalling way to treat repeat customers.",0
"Deliveroo do grocery shopping - what a great concept. Unfortunately this service is not good. I've tried half a dozen times and only had one delivery that was issue free. Usually it's items missing, even though they are checked on the invoice as packed but on two occasions I've had to cancel the order completely after waiting several hours. Very disappointing. It would be zero stars if available.",0
"Nice try but I was promised a call back but no has contacted me. It would seem you either do not know what the fault is, BT caused the fault, or your exchange has been damaged by a third person. It is odd the faults only happen in the evening usually after 8pm and the line only works correctly after human intervention. If no fault found and it fixed it self why did it take at least 5 days before it worked.
I was promised a call back to explain why my landline keeps failing. The fault is causing concern as every time the landline goes down my alarm does not work.
They closed the complaint without speaking to me or explaining the reasons for this re-occurring fault. Its odd that a telephone company does not like making telephone calls.
I feel they do not care about my concerns or honouring any promises they make
Unfortunately I am only offered a one star option otherwise I would select less as all I have received is a negative experience.",0

Customer service have not resolved my issue even though I am constantly complaining about the service.
Talktalk blame City Fibre who it seems were only made aware of my fault a few days ago.

"We recently had an attempted delivery of a fridge. It wouldn't through the door because the installation service stopped the day it was delivered (THIS I understand, give the current situation - this is not my complaint, though if we had know the serivce had stopped, we would have cancelled the delivery) so it had to be returned.

It is now over 2 weeks later and there is absolutely no sign that the fridge was returned and no sign of a refund. No message, nothing. I have been trying to get through on the phone, daily, for the past week, at least once a day. The phone line goes dead after wating on the hold tone for 30 minutes. Today, I got through to chat, and I was hoping to get it sorted on this platform... but the guy I got though to only told me to try calling the phone centre. He was not able to do ANYTHING (apparently) to help. All I read from him was what he 'Can't' do and just pointed me to the phone. So I now have to continue trying to get through on the phones - I have no hope.

I am now in the situation where I am missing a large amount of money, I do not have a working fridge and can't order another one until I get the refund. I have a family of four, including a newborn, to look after and I am not happy about having to go out so often to the shop, potentially endagering my family. This is not acceptable. I am an understanding person and I know that phone lines will be busy. But I was told on the chat that the refund should be issues 3-5 days after the item was returned. As previously mentioned, it's now over two weeks.",0
"I had a 30 Free Trial on NOW TV, including Sky Sports.
I decided not to continue with NOW TV and cancelled well within the 30 days.
Much to my astonishment and annoyance when I received my next VISA statement I saw I had been debited ¬£6.99.
I managed to eventually get a Web chat with customer services who told me Ihad signed up for Kids TV and Now TV Boost!
I don't have children living with me and don't even know what TV Boost is.
I'm convinced I did NOT sign up for these channels.
I did not get any email to tell me I had signed up.
A lot more serious is that I did not get anything in writing that they had set up a Direct.Debit.
The customer service rep agreed that she could see I hadn't used the channels and agreed to refund me.
So, issue resolved? NO.
When I got my next VISA I had again been debited ¬£6.99. (This was dated 28 July 2020, My trial was cancelled by me on 21 June 2020.)
The DD has been cancelled but NOW TV refuse to refund me and have now stopped replying to my emails.
I realise ¬£6.99 is not a lot of money but I believe NOW TV have acted immorally and illegally.
My advice is enter any free trials at your peril.",0
"If I could give no stars, I would. I have been going back and forth with Virgin for weeks now, as I'm missing TV channels from my package, but they're still charging me full price. I have told them countless times how I live with mental health issues, and how ill the stress makes me, but they don't care. They discriminate, and pass you around like they can't be bothered. It's disgusting, and they just don't care about their customers, even when they're vulnerable, like me. Virgin, you should be ashamed!",0

I guess they can charge you as much as they want.",0
"One word.... CRIMINALS. Virgin media are the biggest crooks in the country.
Contract fraud. Bully tactics. Horrendous customer service.
I found an online deal for broadband. This deal offered a streaming box for a one off activation fee of ¬£25. I didnt need the box but thought for ¬£25 i couldn't go wrong. I signed my contract and received the order confirmation on the 09/11/22.
When my bill came in to my horror i had been charged ¬£60 activation fee. I have had numerous calls where the customer service team belittled me and told me my contract stated ¬£60 activation fee. The contract they are talking about was sent on the 10/11/22 a full 24 hours after i had signed my contract and order was confirmed. Virgin simply decided to change a signed contract.. this MUST be illegal. I have refused to pay the extra fee so at just after midnight on the day my bill was due i received a email informing me my service was being cut off.
This forceful act of bullying has put me in a situation i must pay an illegal contract. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COST.",0
"Have bought a phone for ¬£289 on the 19th of August, after waiting for a month (which was supposed to be 7-10 days), I have asked for a refund.

Now they are saying I will get my refund in December, which obviously sounds like a joke.

They are unprofessional and length that you might have to go though to get something out of them is mind-blowing.

Just don't use this company, you will regret it. Maybe they were a legit company at some point in time, definitely not anymore. Buying from a random person on the street would be less shady than this.",0

"I've been trying since 1st June to get a PAC code from 3 as I found a better contract with Plusnet. I've been told they can't generate PAC codes because of a ""systems issue"". This is causing me a real problem as my contract with 3 ended yesterday and I need my number for bank authentication etc. 3 can't tell me when they can fix their systems. They won't even compromise by letting me continue to use their network until they can fix the system. I'll never use them again. I feel cheated.",0
I appreciate these are challenging times. But I have tried for two days now to get through on the phone. I have spent over an hour each time on hold. I am trying to cancel a delivery. So no idea what to do now. I have sent 2 emails too. Unfortunately it will be the poor driver who will have to deal with the problem.,0
Wish I could give 0 stars - this company literally lie to your face and steal money from your pocket. Since leaving them 5 months ago they've assured me that my account is closed and yet keep taking money - and then take more instead of refunding it! They are despicable; steer well clear. I shall be ringing once again to complain and demand adequate recompense and taking it up with the ombudsman too. They should be paying me for time wasted and stress!,0

"I sent my Daughters phone back to QMF for repair in February, as it still had a month left on the warranty. I paid ¬£419.00 for the phone, and also paid a fee for the phone to be sent back to QMF by a tracked and signed for delivery. That‚Äôs was in February! To date I have still not had the phone repaired or returned. I keep getting fobbed off with delaying tactics, and has got to the stage where I have requested a refund. This is now going through the Small Claims Court, and will also be reported to BBC Watchdog. Steer well clear of Quick Mobile Fix!

Imagine waiting for your order for 1.5 hours only to see your order falsely marked as ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù. Then you spend an additional hour with a customer support who gaslight you into thinking that they need to ‚Äúinvestigate further‚Äù (it will take 72 hours) and then MAYBE they will issue the refund. They will ‚Äúissue a decision‚Äù. Please don‚Äôt spend your hard earned money and don‚Äôt use Deliveroo app. P.S. No refund. No attempt of delivery. Please beware of this company.,0

Please be very careful when you buy from them , you better not !",0

"Booked for BT broadband because we were limited to phone line DSL anyway. Was booked for 8th July between 1-6pm I'm self employed took the day off. Got to 18:30pm and i rang the engineers number they texted me who would be turning up, I asked if he was still coming and he said he doesn't even cover my area and the job doesn't exist to him which is fair enough it isn't his fault. I rang BT customer service explain the situation the lady checks the Job and says yeah it's still in progress but its 18:30 and I've spoken to the engineer and he said he isn't coming so it won't happen and she'll escalate it to manager and ring me back the following day between 1700 and 1900. I get no phone call so thats 2/2 times I've been let down. I ring BT explain the situation tell them to check the call log and to escalate it but I have texts saying its now booked in for 3 weeks times onwards and I can't speak to anybody else. Seriously avoid this company their service is the worst I've experienced and I feel I've now had a lucky escape in hindsight.",0
"Simply dishonest.
Online chat for more than an hour. I simply wanted to check my roaming status. Turns out they changed my plan without asking me.
I was assured I was a ‚Äòvalued, long time customer‚Äô and I‚Äôd be offered a great new deal on a sim plan. Whilst waiting I was checking what they offered on the website. The advisor then offers me a worse deal than I could get directly on their website. When I questioned it I got the reply ‚Äôjust let me check the options for you sir‚Äô. Suddenly, surprise surprise, a better offer comes from thin air.
Three UK are completely dishonest. Be really careful and do your homework before you pay their made up price.
No wonder their rating is shocking. I‚Äôm moving all my family (5 accounts) elsewhere.",0
"My delievery of samsung washer drier came .. on date it was supposed to.
All good , until they installed it i had leaks from pipes . Had to call customer services . Someone came nexy day. Said they tested it . No leaks . But they hadent tested obveously as it stll leaked.. so i had to call again .. in total 3 calls to sort this situation . They booked anothher appointment for installation for 1st of feb .. that ment waiting a week. To use my brand new washing machine i paid for to use straight away . .
Never use currys installation service absaloutly rubbish .. not worth it. Find someone who know what they are doing. These guys should only deliver not do installation of these products ,can cause big problems . Please currys employ installation of these products with people who are capable of the job. No Bob the builders please . My partner was going to buy stuff from currys ,but my experience has put him off . Fix up currys ..",0
"AWFUL. It's been nothing but trouble since they repeatedly failed to install it correctly 5 months ago. Engineers didn't turn up, when they did they blamed BT for a dodgy external connection, on the 5th occasion, and 6 weeks AFTER promised installation date, they finally connected it. They refused compensation until I spelt out I would not let this drop. Eventually they paid a paltry amount. Today they disconnected me because apparently money was outstanding on the bill, despite having paid it on Jan 1st. After going through numerous sites to find a direct contact number to speak to a human, and then navigate a zillion options, an excuse was then made regarding my card details dropping of the system in September. If that were the case how were Oct, Nov, Dec bills paid? Infuriating and time consuming, inept and unprofessional. It's not like the bills are vastly cheaper than other providers, fractionally maybe, but not worth it because of the awful service.",0
"Another August 2022 victim of Mazuma's 'random fault' generator (see other negative reviews).

Firstly the reason given for a Good phone being 'dead' relates to iPhones (not a Samsung S8) - remote management lock. Secondly I removed Samsung accounts that support remote wiping before factory resetting the phone and sending it, once I tested that it could be set up as normal.

If you don't want to recycle phones any more just stop trading and wasting our time!",0
"AVOID THIS COMPANY IF YOU VALUE YOUR MONEY
I used this company twice, Ok the first time it was OK but I didn't need to conact them. The second time it was a total disaster. I had to take tham to the small claims court to get my money back and it worked. So don't wait give them reasonable amout of time to sort and if they don't take action. It's easy, online so do it. The after sales is rubbish, I might have guessed, any company that doesn't have a ph number and takes at least 20 mins to respond by chat is rubbish. If you are going to use this company forget the good comments, it's the bad ones you should follow, belive me. In the end I used a comapny who had all good reviews and also had a contact tel no and the service was excellent, forget Quick Mobile fix, there are plenty of good ones around.",0
"People had told me how bad BT was. I didn't quite believe it could be that bad - but it really is. Disorganised, inefficient, problems supposed to be sorted - but not. Not a lot makes me cry. BT managed it.",0
Utter joke. Service meant to start 2 Dec. Still waiting for the hub. Now. Put in a complaint no apologies nothing. The complaint was opened an within an hour was closed with no outcome. I know Royal mail are on strike but why use them if that's the case. Service safe to say utter rubbish. Cancelled. Don't bother if you want good reliable service.,0
The items received were in a massive box too big for the items and not really packaged well. Then the delivery the delivery driver just dumped my item on my front door step in view of passers by as I was not home and then I received an email to say delivered and signed for. I caught the delivery driver leaving my items from my video bell. Lucky I have a relative close by who I called to get my item off the door step or over 100s of pounds of items wouldn‚Äôt have been there when I got home.,0
If there was option below zero I could go for that. This sim is kind of fraud and worst service n network,0
"Worst customer service ever!!! Ordered new washing machine in AUGUST with installation and removing old one. They came few weeks later but couldn't install it because needed ""special engineer"". So we scheduled new delivery day where they just didn't show up. When I called and asked about it they said oh so sorry, you weren't in the system for some reason. And we scheduled another one. When they arrived, they didn't had special engineer with them, although it supposed to be marked in their notes. So again, they scheduled new delivery time for last week and surprise surprise, they didn't show up AGAIN!!! And again same story when I called, oh you weren't in the system for some reason. Just bulls**t!!! It's already November and they still haven't been able to deliver.",0
Terrible site and disgusting people who handle the problems with orders. Try to blame the customer. Avoid this company at all costs.,0
From the start the WiFi was rubbish...I was given a second plug in booster and charged for the privilege and guess what....still rubbish. All the calls I made were no help and WiFi is still slow and doesn't reach some areas.,0

No other updates since and phone not recieved and I'm being told an investigation can't be done yet ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èsurely it it states 24hour delivery and its still not recieved a week later with not a single update on the tracking something should be looked into. I understand they say 7 days but I'd assume that's with standard delivery.,0
Called the customer service team to be hung up on and passed from person to person going through security 4 times to still not even be helped in the slightest bit! To much of a convenience for the staff to help when you call they all tell you different advice and pass you from person to person hoping you will hang up. ABSOLUTELY USELESS WOULDN'T RECOMMEND OR ORDER VIA THEM AGAIN,0
"This is the first day of my broadband/tv/phone calls and I‚Äôm already regretting it, and the customer service is really poor. Firstly, When ringing NowTV with a query, it feels like they‚Äôre not interested, ask you the questions about what package you got etc instead of asking details to look it up. Secondly, I thought I had TV with the package but they confirmed I had to buy a pass. I couldn‚Äôt remember exactly what the offer was, I thought they‚Äôd have all the details there. To compensate me for the wait on the phone, he offered me a pass free of charge for a month. Turns out this is an offer anyway, and you need to unsubscribe to avoid being changed.
I checked online to recall my offer through uswitch which also confirmed the same deal on NowTV website - it was entertainment pass offered at ¬£4.99 a month for 12 months with Super fast broadband and Free calls. That‚Äôs the package I signed up for. Instead I have no passes. Although I am paying ¬£30 for the broadband and free calls, it would cost me ¬£8.99 a month for the entertainment pass. So I called back and spoke to adviser. She told me to go back to uswitch to confront them because my deal came from a third party. Having come off the phone I feel totally ripped off, and angry that I was told to go to uswitch.
I will make a complaint and then go to trading standards. They are really poor, this is the first day of my package. I‚Äôm extremely disappointed to have to deal with this on day one.",0
I‚Äôd give zero iif I could worst customer service bought microwave less than a year ago it blew up I took it back all was fine a replacement was on the counter then she said because I‚Äôd bought it on my curry‚Äôs account online I would have to ring I did 30 mins later a recorded message told me to phone another number I did only to find it was exactly the same message telling me to phone the number I‚Äôd just phoned I phoned customer service eventually I was told DPD would collect but not bring me a new one till it had got back to curry‚Äôs also there‚Äôs a delay on DPD I pointed out it was ridiculous it was paid for they refused to do anything else I‚Äôve wasted 3 hours on this and will never buy from curry‚Äôs again,0
"Probably the worst choice of all the streaming services. Constantly having sync issues where the audio is about 5 seconds late, audio cutting out completely, sound not working through Bluetooth, and random glitches.
Outdated android app and a desktop app that is just a basic video player so you have to go back to the website to find something to watch.
On top of that, to cancel it took about 5 pages of them trying to convince me that their service is worth paying for.",0
"Absolutely the worse company. Been a customer for 23 years. Rang them to say that I was thinking of leaving it as my bill had gone up quite a lot. Went quite some time talking to Sam one abroad who offered me a reduction of ¬£30 on my monthly charge. I said I would think about it and call them back an hour later I called back to confirm but the new person couldn‚Äôt get anywhere near that discount. So I decided to cancel. Then I spoke to another advisor who said that I couldn‚Äôt have a reduction. After spending hours on the phone I left it called back the following day andHad to repeat the whole process again. Still not the reduction I was offered even though they had notes on the conversation confirming the price. After hours spent again I ask to speak with the manager I was so frustrated. She apologised and said the manager would call me within the hour nobody called. called again today going through the whole process again I was told I would need to upgrade my equipment. Really angry now I insisted on speaking with a manager but as usual the managers were busy and couldn‚Äôt speak with me. I was assured that they were very sorry and that someone would call me back by the end of the day. No calls received. I have now cancelled all of my services the phone and TV.

I cannot believe how Incompetent this company was totally unprofessional absolutely disgraceful customer service. I am appalled that no one would call me back. Are you ever able to speak to someone in the UK to discuss this.",0
"When we placed our order the appliance was in stock and we were given a quick delivery date. On delivery day we were phoned to say the delivery van was parked outside at the front of the building on a narrow road with double yellow lines. We had left delivery instructions when ordering the appliance regarding the car park at the back of the building (it should have been a very straightforward delivery) and we explained this again while the delivery men were outside, expecting them to turn the corner and park on the rear car park there. Instead they just drove off without explanation. We were then told by the store that they didn‚Äôt know where our appliance was and there were no more in stock. We were told it would be a week and a half but it is now over two weeks since we placed our order and have not yet heard when our replacement is expected.",0

"I wish there was a score of 0 I could gibe!! Absolutely disgusted!!!
Been with 3 for over 10 years and decided to switch to a cheaper provider with better signal (not hard there!) Checked with the 3 app which said I could cancel and to request a PAC code to keep my number. I did this and received two texts from 3 stated if I used the PAC code today then my bill would be ¬£0 so I did. Que receiving a bill with an early cancellation fee on it for ending my contract 2 weeks early (this was not clear to me). Call 3 and they say the message wouldn't have stated about the bill being ¬£0 and asked me to email the proof team. I did this and was advised I'd hear in a week. A fortnight later I chased it to be told I needed to speak on live chat. Today I spoke with the rudest and most unhelpful person who kept typing the same sentence saying I didn't give notice, fees can't be waivered. It didn't matter how many times I explained that 3 had already said using the code to change provider on the day I did would mean my bill was ¬£0 and contract cancelled, he just kept copy and pasting the same sentence. He then just said ""is there anything else I can help with"" and I said that I wanted this to be escalated and reviewed by management because I'm not happy, my message was ignored for 10 mins and then he kicked me off the chat!!! I have put in a complaint, 3 keep harassing me for this ¬£24 and the only way they will let me speak with someone..... live chat!!! I'm fuming!! You can't tell a customer that ending their contract today would leave their final bill and ¬£0 and then just start charging!!!",0
"Very disappointed, ordered phone for birthday, son wanted a specific older model, I made sure I left a weeks leeway due to lock down. As date approached I got no emails so contacted them and was told there may be a slight delay of a few days, this was acceptable. The delay turned to almost two weeks, not acceptable so I cancelled the order May 1st and was told a refund would take up to 15 working days and here we are 16th June and still no refund. Quote from email after chasing them ""I have requested our finance department to look into your order and they have advised that you will be receiving your refund on or before the 10th of June."" After more chasing I got this ""We have processed your refund on the 10th of June."" So who the hell could the refund be in my account on or before the date they processed the refund. They started to blame the bank for a 7 day processing time, interestingly another refund agreed Friday 12th June was in my bank Monday 15th June. I cant say whether Quick Mobile fix goods are any good as I didn't receive any but if their customer service is anything to go by I would give these guys a complete miss as Im still waiting my refund over 6 weeks now.",0
"Been waiting around all day for a delivery between 8-5, logged back into my account to see my order has been cancelled? No email to notify me that my order has been cancelled, and full payment has already been taken.

No way to run a business, taking peoples money and then cancelling orders without letting them know.

"Absolutely horrendous customer service. My subscription was suppose to start at Nov 1st, until now(nov3) it still not online. Called multiple times. 30mins wait everytime. My last call today was for 50mins (excluding the wait time, and i was told that they moved the date to the 5th and they cannot give me any reason whatsoever and was basically told that there is nothing i can do and nothing they will do, and just accept that fact.

"I've been with Vodafone for mobile and home broadband for years and never had any issues. I always found support efficient. However, my recent experience has wiped out any confidence that I had with them. Broadband upgrade to full fibre went off schedule when open reach didn't install the fibre optics in time.
Not vodafones fault, but I was assured by vf that the install would still go ahead as planned. Waited in all day for no one to arrive.
Contacted vf to be told that the Installation date had moved by 3 weeks. Waited in all day for no one to arrive.
Contacted vf to be told that it had now been moved by another 10 days.
That's today.
Contacted vf to find out what time today, to be told that the whole order has been cancelled, My adsl is due to be terminated this evening as part of the fibre upgrade.
So I've no fibre and no Internet as from tomorrow.
I'm stubborn and ordinarily I'd tell them to shove it where the sun doesn't shine, however the compensation due will be huge. Maybe pay for two years internet, so I'm sticking with them just for the fun of the compensation claim.",0
"Reported internet service failure over two weeks ago, that means that our landline is inopperable too. After a week BT realised that the problem lay with Open Reach, they admitted that this was obvious from the start. Openreach had a team on the site the next day, found the fault, promised to fix it quickly and then nothing happened despite me regularly chasing through BT. I can not contact Open Reach directly (despite their name) and BT can only message them. So..on day 15 I still have no idea when this will be fixed, no access to landline and any messages left there.

The onus is on Trustpilot as I very much doubt the validity of there 5* reviews, looks like relatives/employees are trying to keep their stars up.
Unless you buy with a credit card and wish several months of chasing someone working out of their bedroom at their Mum's house, pay another ¬£20 and get a phone that exists from another supplier.
I have also been receiving lots of cold calls since I ordered, so it looks like they sell your personal details also.

I called to cancel and get a refund which supposed to be in my account in 3-5 working days and it's been 2 months and still THE SAME REPLY EVERY WEEK ,3-5 DAYS.I filled a complain form and didn't have a reply
I call today AGAIN to speak with the manager she tells me it's the bank's problem.My reply was ""ok, I call my bank and I call you back"". So I call my bank and they tell me they NEVER BLOCK a refund. I call again,the employer named ""Dan"" Was reeeeeally rude!!!I intend to speak with the manager and he doesn't let me,he replies just ""No"". He says I can connect you with the billing team but I won't do that. It's taking 3-5 days and I try to explain to him that I been told the same thing over 10 times and you don't listen what I say.He starts yelling and speak over my voice. He almost hang up the phone to me whilst I was still talking. I will go to a lawyer for that.",0
I ordered the GHD heat protector spray as a present for my daughter for Christmas and it still has not arrived.,0
"I have been a customer for 5 years but have had it. Will try and sum up:

Pros:
The broadband doesn't go down

Cons:
You have to be very vigilant on your bills. E.g.

They will raise the price of broadband without telling you, and so you have to call up to go back onto the package you've signed up for.

Beware signing up for any TV package as they will add on ""free intros"" to other packages without telling you (although I'm sure it's somewhere in the very fine print) which you then don't cancel because you never knew it existed, and you see charges on your bill.

The new customer offers always seem to be lower than what you're on.

The customer service for Broadband and TV is split. Broadband is OK, there is a phone number and they can usually do what you need. But the TV customer service is in a hard-to-find chatbox. There is no phone number, and the Broadband phone operators had to give me advice on how to best navigate it. A complete mess.",0
"Customer service is terrible.
Very inconsistent. They simply cannot understand what problems are. Therefore cannot effectively resolve any issues.",0
"I took out an upgrade with Carphone Warehouse on the 4th December 2022. The phone arrived on the 6th December however it had a new sim and new number associated with it. I was told that as it was an upgrade, I would keep my existing number and billing details so contacted their support team, who quickly fobbed me off to Vodafone.

Upon contacting Vodafone, it was confirmed that a new contract had actually be taken out, alongside my existing one. i asked if the number could be swapped over, however was told this would take 30 days and during this time I would have to pay 2 contracts.

I then went into my local Carphone Warehouse store and was told ""It's an online issue, you'll have to deal with it online"", however he suggested I should upgrade there and then in store. This thought is laughable, that I would then be expected to pay another upfront cost and possibly have a third contract based on their previous attempts to upgrade me.

I then called the contact center again, explained the issue to the operator who confirmed that someone had made a mistake and started a new contract rather than an upgrade. She explained despite it being a Carphone Warehouse error, I would either have to pay the two contracts until Vodafone could swap my numbers, or alternatively return the phone and start again. Since I was not going to pay for 2 contracts, I chose the return option and started this process.

While on this call I was emailed a returns label for a DPD drop off, however explained to the operator I had no way of printing this. She suggested I ""go to an internet cafe to print it"", which is a ridiculous request, having to drive to an internet cafe to pay to print a label that was only needed due to a Carphone Warehouse mistake. I explained that this was not an option, so she said that with this label the DPD drop off store could print it for me, something I said was unlikely as they were all local corner shops. She was adamant this was the case, so the call ended there.

Upon driving to my local store, I was told that no they do not print the labels and it needs to be on the parcel already. I tried another store and had the same response.

At this point I was livid with Carphone Warehouse and the service they had given, so I called them again to see what I was supposed to do with this phone that I needed to return. Luckily this person was a little more helpful and explained DPD could collect the phone from me, with no label and arranged this for the 7th December. I will see tomorrow if they will collect it without a label.

Overall my experience with Carphone Warehouse has been shocking. They made a mistake on the order, have passed me from person to person, made me liable for 2 phone contracts (possibly effecting my credit score) and had a very poor attitude in resolving the issues. I have requested their management call me to discuss, however I am skeptical this will happen.

7/12/22 Update: They cancelled the collection with no explanation or update (simply a DPD link saying that it has been cancelled). I have tried contacting their social media as they have pointed others to do below, however just keep getting told you have to return it, ignoring the fact they cancel their collections when I try.

9/12/22 Update: They ask you to contact their social media, yet when you do they ignore you for hours at a time to respond with a scripted answer. When calling the call centre I was greeted with yet more useless scripted responses and considering they kept telling me they ""understand my frustration"" they clearly could not verbalize this understanding, into actually answering any questions.

15/12/22 Update: There social media team are useless, when i asked to raise a complaint with them they responded (eventually) with ""we are the social platform team, we can not help with that"".

Surprisingly, I have been charged for the second contract despite returning the phone to Carphone Warehouse last week. I spoke to their customer service team and was told I would have to speak to Vodafone directly as they had cancelled the contract on their end. I explained they would not talk to me as they needed to text a security code to the new number (which I no longer had as it had been returned) so could not verify my account. She said this was Vodafone issue and could not assist more, despite me being a customer of Carphone Warehouse.

I have made a complaint through their official complaints procedure on the phone, but highly doubt anything will be done, as it was just the operator noting what I had to say. On several occasions I have asked for their management team to call me but have received nothing,",0
"my go live date was suppose to be on the 28th of september, the only thing ive been told is that openreach is experinceing delays in activating my line. my new job heavily relies on internet. im still waiting and i juuust moved into the property as well.",0
Purchased a mobile phone for my wife on 4th January 2020. It was faulty in that when sending a text the error message showed 'not sent'. In fact it had been sent but there was no means of knowing for sure if it was successful. Returned to the Reading Branch only to be told it was due to a weak signal. The problem was not solved so we returned again only to be told it was poor storage in the camera. On the third occasion we were informed that it was due to a time lag on the server. The fourth visit informed the sim card was faulty. Because of their delay in sorting out the problem we were told that we could not have a refund or replacement as it was outside their 28 day period. to claim. I think that staff learn how to 'fob-off' customers to avoid refunds or replacements. Staff had a couldn't care less attitude with sloppy management. Use an honest company that values goodwill instead.,0
"I have been with BT for 15 years as Business Customer 3 years ago i asked for my business line to be transferred to a residential line when talking to the team they said that they could do the same deal as residential at circa ¬£25 per month yes this was the case however they loaded additional charges line rental, directory services, and premium rates for calls making the quarterly bill ¬£215. This has been done to me 3 times now. So today i told them to cancel the contract on the 17th June two weeks from now when my contract comes to an end. the advisor said no problem and then i received an email saying that they would terminate my line the following day leaving me without broadband and phone line. No problem you think i will just have BT residential take it over the advisor said this could take 10 working days. why if i am a BT Business Customer can they not just transfer me to BT residential? i am disgusted with BT and the way they have mislaid me spending over ¬£2000 on services i never needed with all the hidden extras. i am now trying to stop the cancellation and have been on the phone for 3 hours as the line to india keeps dropping and i need to call them back and restarting the conversation. i have now over 15 pin numbers they send you which shows the number of conversations i have had with them. Shame on you BT your customer service sucks!!!",0
"Absolutely disgusting customer service.
If anyone ask for my advice I would cancel their direct debits with them as they take money out and don‚Äôt even refund it back. My gas and electric bill is ¬£168 every month and last month they took ¬£360 out and when I rang them they said they will refund it back as it was an estimate bill and I should have smart meter installed. I cancelled my DD after that as I don‚Äôt want any more surprise amounts coming out of my bank. And asked for e-bills and now they done me over in the bill. Over charging me . And the customer service is awful. Apparantly you can‚Äôt talk to managers . They review customer complaint and if they think it worth ringing back then they ring back otherwise they don‚Äôt. Like really!!! What about customer service and treating customer fairly. What happened to consumer rights.

"Bought a Beco fridge freezer in October 2017 and took out warrantee plan. A freezer drawer broke in April 2020 , I claimed for a new one and was told it would be delivered. It came after a month and both the drawer and the front (sold separately) were wrong. Phoned and spoke to a mature gentleman who seemed interested and knowledgeable. Gave him dimensions and he promised me correct parts. Just the drawer came this time. Wrong size Nothing came in a month so I phoned and was told parts not available. I had checked on espares and they were in stock. Told him and he said they could only use approved suppliers. I heard nothing after 2 months and took up the case again today. Was told the plan had expired when it hadn't. An hour of calls between engineers and warrantee departments. Lady in Careplan said definitely covered and gave me a reference number. Engineer did not believe me and referred me back to Careplan who said unless I wanted to pay for the whole of the plan again they couldn't help me. I want nothing to do with them now. My advice is not to go into Currys if you're thinking of having a warrantee on your purchase. Having read the other reviews, I will alter that advice to don't go to Currys at all.",0

"SECOND ATTEMPT TO POST MY HONEST REVIEW AS QMF HAD IT REMOVED I HAVE ALL PROOF NEEDED

DO NOT USE, THEY ARE CON ARTISTS!!!
DO NOT use ‚ÄúQuick‚Äù mobile fix I ordered an iPhone 7 for my sons birthday on the 27th March 2020 for an email saying will be dispatched within 7-10 working days however this didn‚Äôt happen I tried to contact them and they said due to the current situation its taking longer and the item is being tested before being dispatched, why advertise an item you have for sale if you don‚Äôt even know it works? I contacted them again as it was getting closer to my sons birthday and got no response, I sent them yet another email asking them to cancel my order, I got a reply back saying sorry for the inconvenience do I still want to proceed I responded with ‚ÄúNO please cancel my order an issue an refund‚Äù.
I had to order another phone from else where, that one came the next working day thankfully, but a week later I get a notification telling me that they (QMF) have dispatched the phone. I did not accept the delivery I contacted the delivery company immediately and told them not to deliver it and send it back, quick fix mobile finally updated me to tell me they received it back and I should receive my refund within 14 working days this was in April and I was still waiting in til the end of May I contacted them again and they were still blaming the current situation and informed me I should get my refund by 19th June I told them straight away that isn‚Äôt acceptable as they told me 14 working days as the law states and they have gone against that

Iv had to raise this with my bank and my bank waited ages for quick fix mobile to get back to them as they don‚Äôt seem to care, I have also spoken to citizens advice and they have taken this to trading standards I have also reported them to Direct Gov under the companies acting unfairly during COVID-19 I suggest you all do the same and when Trading Standard get enough complaints about this company they will be shut down with any luck

I finally got my money back on the 19th June but through the bank as the company still didn‚Äôt stick to their agreement with the refund, then on the 30th November 2020 the bank took the money back as quick mobile fix apparently provided proof so I contacted the bank and asked if they can see a refund from quick mobile fix going into my account they said no, so I said QMF have sent me an email confirming they received the phone back so I have no phone and no refund and I will send them this proof if whey want to see it, they are an absolute joke of a company and they shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to trade they are con artists who take advantage of people, the young lady I spoke with at the bank has heard of this company and said she will refund the money as a goodwill gesture and the case is now closed but that should never have happen in the first place they are lying to banks

I have all emails if trust pilot wants to see them just in case quick mobile fix tries to say that I‚Äôm lying, I also have screen shots from the bank",0
"I called Now TV about cancelling my broadband in late January. They then said I need to call again when I want to cancel my contract. Now that I wanted to cancel it, they said that there will be a 2 week period before I can do so.
They also booked the wrong option for me, when I joined and you can not transfer your account to another name (which is a problem if you live in a shared household and one of the tenants is moving out).",0

"When your repair man and listened to my complaint, he took the top off and after asking him what was wrong, he said the water pipes were connected incorrectly and changed them over.
I find it frustrating your delivery men didn‚Äôt know how the machine worked. I have waster 2x 6 1/2 hours electric machine time and the washing was dripping wet. I would like a sub-refund for this power I have wasted. My washing is on now in hope it washes, spins and tumble dries. If not, I would like a refund to enable me to buy another make",0
"It had potential but they have wasted it with three key actions:
1) Its too expensive for 720p
Full price for movies and tv is well over 17 quid now for 720p stereo! Netflix 4k is 12 quid.
The boost to get it to HD doesnt work on any off the apps - you have to have a stick - even on the latest LG or samsung smart tv apps! Also this costs 3 quid extra!! Also even then no 4k and no HDR!

Therefore you can get netflix 4k and amazon prime 4k - for less money than 1080p Now tv which also has to be done via a seperate stick!

2) Their customer service is simple not there, any issues are a struggle to get any support live chat is down most of the time and now way to call someone! Not great for a arm of sky! Also when signing in it constantly takes you to the irish site, pretty sure this is due to them doing doge tax avoiding methods.

3) Their line up is now suffering from the emergence of Disney+. The new movies on their platform is suffering badly already, most of the disney / fox / marvel stuff has disappeared. Only the sony stuff staying on for now.

TL:DR version. Too expensive, Low quality streams, bad service and dying content library.

This by far is the worst streaming option of the lot atm. They got too overconfident being sky and havent provided any form of value for money compared to netflix (which i used to think was expensive in comparison), amazon (best value if you use prime alot) and disney + (not the greatest value but has rights to some of the best content atm)",0

"I have been waiting over six weeks for my wifi to be activated!! I rang up to check the status to be told that they may need another week‚Ä¶ although there had been no contact from BT to myself about this update. Just awful customer service.

Do not use car phone warehouse to trade your phone in!! I traded in two phones and was told to send them both in the same packaging. I received confirmation and payment for one phone but my second phone is no where to be seen.all they say is we will escalate this and the warehouse will investigate. Clearly someone thought they would pocket the other phone and car phone warehouse do not care. I asked to speak to a manager and for some reason got passed to a senior salesperson who was a toilet and hung up on me. 4 weeks ago this process started and still no further to finding out what is happening and also not one call or email from car phone warehouse. Shocking service sell your phone elsewhere,0
"Worse experience ever with the so called ""Full Fibre"" future broadband. Back in July, got text msg from Openreach on behalf of Talktalk, offering full fibre. Arrangements were made for the engineer to bring the fibre from the street through indoor and they turned up on the day and pulled in the fibre and fitted the connecion box, only the new router which should have been delivered days earlier was nowhere to be seen. I ended up without internet/broadband for 4 (four days) from 06th August through 09th August. Working from home, this was so frustrating that I decided to switch suppliers right away on the 06th, contacted my current provider who promised to complete the switch on 22nd August, and they delivered. A better and faster broadband package than Talktalk, at yet a lower price than Talktalk. Meantime, Talktalk full fibre download speed never exceeded 18Mbps and upload at 8.7Mbps for a contract prommising 65Mbps. Have called them and requested cancellation, never got a letter or e-mail confirming I had left Talktalk. No apology in the form of e-mail or letter for the 4 days without service they were supposed and contracted to deliver to me. Logged into the account today, and ""My Package"" still says'Fibre 65Voip, your contract comes to an end on 06/02/24' altough their system has records of my calls on 01 September and 12 September reminding my request for cancellation. Am being told it can take up to 30 days to complete the cancellation process!!! Why does it take less days to sign up new customers.

"Attempting to cancel the maintenance on a phone system we no longer use at our business is essentially impossible. So now we're just going to not pay any more bills that arrive and see what happens. No doubt they'll pass the debt onto debt collectors and we'll explain the situation with them.

Long story short, I contacted customer services who directed me to an online 'cancel maintenance' form I needed to complete - which I did. However, one question asks if you've read the terms and conditions, and if you select no, it will not allow you to submit the form. But clicking the link to the terms and conditions doesn't work. It just times out. So I just selected yes and made it clear to the customer service rep that it wasn't working so I had no way of reading them. They never replied and even though the form says they'll be in touch within 7 working days, I've never heard anything from them. This was three months ago and today I've received another bill. The customer service rep never responded to me either.

I could go on about other negative experiences with BT going back to when we first signed up with them in 2016 (e.g. taking over two years to finally get a refund of almost ¬£1000 we were owed), but I think I'd rather stick toothpicks under my finger nails then dredge up the countless anxiety-inducing pastimes I've had with this infuriating company.",0

"Went to CPW shop in Leicestershire ( don't want to embarrass them) by saying where.
I wanted to replace my phone with an upgraded spec and a handset size that I felt comfortable with.
The first assistant, was more clueless than me, so asked to speak to someone else. They were not much help, I asked for suggestions of what I should consider. It would have been easier to extract Unicorn teeth for the advise I got
I was left to look around the shop. On display I saw a phone that sounded and looked just right.. It was labled a Moto g6plus. I decided to buy this and pay extra for data transfer. Phone wasn't in stock so had to go back next day to collect.
Next day went to get new phone. They unboxed it but to my surprise the phone was not what they had on display ( apparently that was a Moto g)
I was very annoyed as unboxed phone was nothing like what I had ordered. Staff there didn't seem concerned/bothered , no apology basically take it or leave attitude. I suggested they remove or relable phone on display...3 days later they hadn't!!! What joke they are.
Folks, you may as well buy your phone online and get it cheaper..no wonder the high street is dying""",0

The call taker is rude and robotic and refused to allow me to speak to a supervisor and told me she couldn't send me an email to tell me what she had done in relation to refunding me back 3 months worth of money bt had taken after cancelling their services and contacting them about it and them telling me they had sorted it! She then told me she couldn't tell me her name and eventually hung up. Not only have they continued to take money they now want to charge me for cancelling my service within the 14 days cooling off period! Absolutely disgusting service. They've taken another load of money out and put me overdrawn and when asked for them to put it back in I was told 3-4 working days. I told them I want the. To back it and they as a company can foot the bill as I will be charged for going overdrawn and was told its not their problem!! How is it mine when it's 3 months after cancelling their services. They owe me ¬£60+ and are telling me they will give me ¬£20 and that's it!!!!!,0

Fine, so I wait, the 3rd rolls around and no delivery. I then recieve an email on the 6th Dec, the same as the first now stating delivery would be 12-13th Dec but thats tomorrow and I've had no dispatch email or DPD tracking sent to me so I already know its not coming. Customer service has not responded after a week and so I've now had to escalate my messages to ""Paul"" whoever that may be. Its been 4 weeks now and the item was for a xmas gift. All i want at this point is a refund. Why advertise items and take peoples money for things that you don't even have in stock!!?? What a shambles of a company!!

"I was a Vodafone Mobile customer for over 20 years. Two years ago I took Home Broadband with them too. One of the biggest mistakes of my life. Since my Home Broadband expires in a month, I wanted to upgrade and my upgraded was twice cancelled. When I spoke to them, they told me I couldn't get a upgrade because there's no Broadband service at my address and needed an engineer to come out to install all lines beforehand. I couldn't help laughing at the guy and asked him if he new what he was doing? Bare in mind this was from a UK based call centre and therefore the agent was english. For the last two years, every single month Vodafone messed-up my direct debit payment by saying I had no direct debit setup. I told them I have the bank statements showing that money were taken out by direct debit, but they kept saying my bank cancelled the direct debit. Bank confirmed it was cancelled by them. In the end, I decided to do not renew my Home Broadband and Phone service with them in July. Stay well away from them as they are incompetent, rude, and mostly very sly. I rather pay more, but get a reliable Service Provider who doesn't put PROFIT before their customers. NEVER AGAIN VODAFONE !!!!",0
"Disgusting service
I have placed an order on saturday the 17th december, for delivery on the 18th.
I have received a text saying ""we couldn't deliver your order"", although i was at home all day and have 24/7 concierge service and even made a note it can be left downstairs.
I called on Monday, they couldn't explain what happened and rebooked it for the next day.
Again not delivered, so called again.
Not able to explain why, rebooked for wednesday (today).
So i called in the morning and told them i m really worried.
So they ""checked the system"" and confirmed the order is out for delivery and will definitely be delivered today, without a doubt.
The slot was for 10-1 pm, so at 2pm my order was not yet delivered, no phone call, text, email, update on my account, nothing.
So I went on their web chat and requested for the order to be cancelled and a refund issued, which they confirmed it was done.
Checking my account the order is at the same stage ""sit tight, we are processing your order for delivery on 21/12/22 10-1pm"". Really???
Very disappointing

They are continually putting barriers in the way and do not want to send out an engineer. Not at all impressed. You do not need this much hassle to resolve something that is not my fault.

After a month I'm with no internet, and now will not have it for Christmas.
When I rang to organise a new contract (again) - I asked for compensation for the mistake they made (which was very minimal).

"At the end of an 18 month contract, I contacted customer support to extend my contract another 18 months and they attempted to pressure me into buying a slower package for nearly twice the cost, trying to sell it as a one time offer for existing customers. After making me pretty angry with them and me deciding to cancel outright to get a better deal elsewhere they then finally offered a fairer price. End result was a lower monthly fee for the same package for me, albeit not as good as new customer prices, but what a total waste of time for everyone, I would have just been happy to continue at current price if it had just been offered up front! I just feel like my custom is not valuable to them and they've wasted my time.

According to the customer service agent they are incentivized to re-up customers to new contracts on worse deals using pressure tactics as part of a sales drive. OFCOM should require service providers to offer new customer deals to customers at the end of existing contracts to stop this nonsense.

The pressure tactics used are also not OK though, I can see some people being ripped off or being taken advantage of.",0

I then discovered that BT would not guarantee that I would keep my existing landline number and that it might be allocated to someone else. I established that BT did ""own"" my number, so they could in theory re-allocate it to me. When I pointed out that my contacts could then be phoning my old landline number and some unsuspecting person would be getting frequent ""wrong number"" calls, BT agreed that that would happen.

"I have been with Virgin for 20 years - I put up with the customer service (use that word loosely) as I liked the TV - I'v lost years of saved programmes/films ! After a whole week last February/March where I lost TV/Broadand/Landline, 4 promised visits where no one showed up .. I finally got ¬£210 compensation. I was due to finish my contract in May so I decided to leave. I was called by a guy who promised to be my ""dedicated"" account holder, he would make sure I didnt suffer the same problems trying to contact customer service, I am sure you have all been there, half an hour of calling, to have the phone answered and then half way through telling them your issue .. you get cut off ! I agreed to a new 2 year contract under these terms. However after a month - Virgin took the compensation back, they didn't tell me. I found out by seeing my Direct Debit continue to go out every month to pay my bill. It took a month of phone calls every 2 days to find out why. All I could get out of them was it was ""mis-applied"" so I decided to leave, however that meant I had to pay an early exit fee, I paid under duress as I felt I was cheated by Virgin, I couldn't stay with them for the next 2 years. I gave notice via the BOT. But when it came to my leaving, in August - they had ""no record"" of my conversation, even though I did and said I can send them the screen shots of my conversation. I had to stay another month and that cost me ¬£59. I made a complaint and all I get is letters saying to call customer care and that's their ""resolution"". No one has ever called me, despite being promised call backs. I feel I have been lied to & cheated out of my money .. this is against CPR but they still dont care. Do yourself a favour and dont even enter into a contract with Virgin, you will live to regret it !

"Every time i have been in any Argos store the service has been terrible. I bought a foldable chair from the Ealing Broadway store and upon opening i realised it was faulty, the screws were loose. I took it back the NEXT day and the manager refused to refund me and said it was accidental damage due to falling from a height. Honestly never heard of anything more ridiculous, how can one tell me HOW the accidental damage happened, especially since theres no other damage other than loose screws. I asked to speak to someone above her who apparently was in another store (I called him), he gave me a reference and said to give it to her and that she should refund me as its faulty however she still refused. Her words were 'I understand but i still cant refund you'.

This is the reason Argos is going down hill, managers have more authority over their customer service (as customer service also told me she could refund me but she's being difficult, they said theres nothing they can do as their managers have their own desecration and can do as they please). This isn't the first time its happened as they did this with an iPad i bought in the past, that was faulty when i opened it, again they said it was an accidental damage, they use that excuse for everything to refrain from refunding you on anything. I've now definitely learnt my lesson. Never buying from there again.",0

Don‚Äôt use this company for buying Washing machines. I used them for years but this time was a nightmare!! I ordered a washing machine delivery 2 days later yep lovely thought I. The drivers arrived and started to take the old washing machine away but couldn‚Äôt fit the new one because their policy is the waste disposal pipe wasn‚Äôt 60cm. This is the only electrical company. A total day wasted,0
"Never order from this company! I have been waiting 4 months for my refund and still no reply! I am now going to have to take legal action as this is absolutely ridiculous and unfair.

I wish I read the reviews before dealing with this company.",0
"Absolute cr*p company. Useless incompetent staff, appalling broadband and the worst customer service ever. This company is a joke!

Alot of the people leaving reviews here lack any common sense.
Firstly it doesn't matter if you are within your contractual agreement you can cancel without paying any fees if they are not providing the level service promised when signing up! Secondly if they are charging your cards before the the free trial is up then you contact your bank and they will raise a charge back for this! As annoying as these scummy companies are, they will continue to rip people off if you all do so moan and not act!",0
"I took a day of annual leave to be home for a broadband installation. After receiving a total of 6 reminders that I need to be home for this, nobody turned up. Then I get the delights of having to deal with Vodafone's Customer Service Team on the phone! My day just went from bad to worse, not to worry though, apparently for wasting my entire day I get ¬£26.24 credited to my phone acct. Well lots of luck with that as I'll be cancelling it as soon as I've finished typing this out. What an absolute bunch of fisters that genuinely could not give a toss about their customers.",0
I can‚Äôt believe I ordered two iPhone 13 and I just received only one. It blows my mind. And they think like what? I am going to pay for a phone I never had. So disappointed I am thinking to cancel even the one that arrived and order directly from Vodafone.,0
"We have had 3 engineers come to repair our washing machine and it‚Äôs still leaking and tripping the electric.
Engineers do not test their repairs. It gone 2 weeks now since we‚Äôve been able to use machine. Surely they should replace machine now?",0
"Horrible experience. Keep taking money from my account without my consent even when our contract ended.
Just avoid",0
"Polite team but that is it. Integrated dishwasher installed by Team knowhow but went wrong almost right away. Manufacturer came out and blamed the installation team, and said I should never use them. Called support spent 3 hours on the phone to try and get it sorted. Ended up with having to go to store to arrange collection but they would not disconnect it. Took over 4 weeks to resolve the issue, let alone get the refund!
The call centre team are terrible they promise to call you or send emails but don't bother. Call system itself is a nightmare to use and I spoke to so many team members who promised a lot but never did anything correctly.
Wish I had never gone to the store, certainly wont in the Future. Shop floor staff were helpful but everything else was a nightmare.
Will not go near Currys ever again.",0
"UPDATE:

I did respond to you Studio. And I responded the 3 previous times and you did not reply. So I emailed your CEO. Date: 16.12.22

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Studio are getting their employees to write fake reviews!!! I have written to the CEO of studio and trustpilot. The trading standards will be alerted next as they failed to rectify or even acknowledge complaints to a professional level, instead they‚Äôre using antics such as this.

Companies with such a magnitude of issues and complaints like this don‚Äôt last long. Whilst you may receive your goods, the crap hits the fan if there is any slight hint of an issue. This company are totally incompetent of dealing with complaints and would rather pass you around or refer to to debt collectors (when the debt isn‚Äôt even yours).

I‚Äôve had to go to the ombudsman now and the ICO have issues Studio is a legal warning to prosecute and add them to the list of companies failing to comply with legislation. It‚Äôs a public notice board so to speak. Please be careful when ordering from this company. They are dodgy as hell!",0
"Be very careful!!!!
There is no small print and it's impossible to get hold of them unless you POST THEM A LETTER !!!!
In 2019 you're expected to POST THEM A LETTER !!!!!!
The service packages autorenew and unless you POST THEM A LETTER you cannot cancel.
The service offerings are also falsely represented and you do not get what you paid for.",0

"I recieved a faulty phone with a fake screen and burned out battery that i had to send back and then after 4 months recieved the supposed replacement , the optimised battery was only at 74% which is completely and utterly horrendous , although the service and reply time was so horrendous i decided to just take the phone to the local tech shop and have them replace the battery there , where i was told again that the screen that was on the phone was a cheap chinese screen that was drawing lots of power out the battery , this company should not be allowed to operate , it is criminal the service they provide",0
"Update from my last rant about talk talk.Still not had a phonecall from the manager despite receiving email six days ago to say that someone would call in three days time!
This time scale appears to have increased because initially I was told if receive a call within 48 hours!!.still never happened !!

Thank you Dhanasagree from Talk Talk team,but I'm not happy to contact Talk Talk yet again to discuss my complaint.

I have already called your department several times already,been passed from pillar to post and not prepared to be kept waiting the phone for another hour of which at least 20 minutes was waiting time!! Next stop ombudsman,enough is enough!!",0
"Cancelled because they take my money but force adverts on me, which they're also getting paid for! What a cheek. We pay for streaming services to AVOID adverts! Plus, they split Entertainment and Cinema, so you have to pay ¬£10 a month for each. They don't update their movies very often, so there's very little on offer that you haven't already watched. Getting fed up with streaming services, like Now, Amazon and Netflix (who btw allowed me to get hacked and pay for a group in Colombia to watch Netflix at my cost!).",0
I have been waiting 5 weeks for parts for an old tumble dryer that parts are probably obsolete,0
"Extremely poor service and definitely no quick fix to any mobile phone issue, I'm still waiting for the delivery 12 wks later!!!! When I contacted the customers services team the first time after approx 1 mth they said the delays were due to COVID and my phones would be checked and ready to be sent to me by the end of the week.
I've eventually been offered a refund but it has taken some pestering to get it and they say it will take x 2 to get back into my account.
Don't bother, go elsewhere",0
"Awful company. I was moved to shell when my previous company went bust and since have been unable to move companies because of the energy crisis. Recently they wrote me an email saying they will be billing me for a second meter which is an old disconnected one on the property that they've just 'found'. They act like they're doing me a favour. I replied that it was disconnected and not in use, even sent photographic proof etc etc. I then received a call asking for all my personal information to verify who I am even though they called me. After all this rigmarole I was told they couldn't help me and someone would have to call me the following week. The call never came but I received an email this time saying an appointment to have a smart meter fitted has been made for me. I don't want a smart meter, I never asked for one and I am unavailable on the day in question regardless. I was not consulted in any of this. I was told someone would call me and explain and give me options. Not that they would make decisions about my property for me.
I tried to call and explain but the guy on the phone couldn't be bothered so hung up. Shell is a horrible immoral company that is trying to steal from hard working people. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Been over 3 years with their phone insurance. Just before cancelling contract I decided to claim phone (never claimed before) and renew my contract in September after getting new phone.
‚ÄúRefurbished‚Äù phone came with faulty camera, therefore they suggested me to bring phone and get fixed because it has 1 year warranty.
As just came from holiday, phone got wet and water damaged, and I was shocked to know that warranty is void now because it‚Äôs water damaged.
Just to clarify phone is iPhone X and had IP67 rating (half an hour in 1 meter depth doesn‚Äôt do anything to the phone), which shouldn‚Äôt die putting in wet shorts pocket. Therefore phone should be waterproofed regardless of what they did to fix it before whilst refurbishing. Obviously phone is ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù and they didn‚Äôt put any seals to waterproof it again. Absolutely useless customer service. Complaint will be dealt by Financial Ombudsman Service.

Never again.",0
"Terrible Customer Service.
Got a call out of the blue when I had 6 months left on my contract asking me if I wanted a security feature added to my package for an extra 4 pounds a month. I said sure why not. The bloke added 18 months onto the contract without asking me.
I have since spent the better part of 8-10 hours over 2 weeks on hold, being bumped around different departments before eventually being hung up on. I have had to re-explain my issue again and again - why is there no record being kept of what I'm complaining about?! I eventually got put on with the right person who reassured me complaints department would call me - why could they not deal with the issue there & then. They called twice and both times there was no sound on the other end of line - have since called multiple times and am experiencing the same issue as before or people tell me my only options are to keep the 18 month contract or pay a cancellation fee of around 160 quid then hang up on me. All I want to do is go back to my original contract before the sneaky salesperson added terms to a contract I didn't ask for or approve.
Having read all the reviews it appears they know exactly what they are doing as multiple people have experienced the same issue. I would argue this is a technique by TalkTalk to milk their customers of as much money as possible. Terrible business practise and have no regard for their customers.
Thieves. Would not recommend to anyone.",0
"I ordered food. I live in no.57 of a standard street. I then get a message saying ‚Äòwe have left your food outside‚Äô. There is no food. I call and they say ‚Äòsorry but those are our terms, no compensation‚Äô. I escalate it. They say, ‚Äòno more food and no refund‚Äô. I am genuinely shocked. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.

"I ordered a phone at the start of January, for ¬£130. Received an email stating that the phone wasn‚Äôt in stock, but a more expensive phone was available if I sent more funds.

I immediately cancelled the order and requested a refund. I received an email informing me that the refund will be processed within two weeks, with a small chance of having to wait longer due to ‚Äòcoronavirus‚Äô.

Then I checked Trustpilot reviews and realized that the chances of me getting a refund were slim, that the site is basically a scam and held little hope of ever seeing my money again. I regretted not checking Trustpilot before the purchase.

Anyway, after several emails over two months, that ALL went unanswered, I initiated a chargeback process with my bank, and have received the funds back today.

This site is a pure and utter scam, and ought to be shutdown with a criminal investigation into it.",0
"Washing machine ordered mid Dec 20 and date given for delivery. It didn't turn up. When questioned they initially stated it had been delivered but soon backpeddled and stated it was damaged in transit. New date given (26/01/21) and not delivered again. Done track and trace with team knowhow and it stated it was delivered at 0928 and was signed for with a digital sig in the box on the tracking, not my signature. Rang curry's who stated there system said delivery had been rejected when no attempt had even been made to deliver. They spoke to the carrier who said they hadn't even put it on the van.

Go back to BT who claim Sky are only given poor appointment times and they can definitely do before Xmas. So I go with BT. They send me my order but unfortunately for them leave their internal coding in it which shows my pre Xmas order date is actually a cancel only affair and the install is in the new year on the same day as sky. I wasted three hours on this to be back at where I started. BT are utter Juankers and I imagine OFCOM will do sweet sod all. When you try to complain and log in BTS system puts you in a loop. Hate them already, don‚Äôt they know how stressful buying a house is? Utter toads.",0
"Second review of Cex, second time trying to get this pair of headphones in a grade A condition.

First time ordered them, they turned up and Bluetooth connectivity was faulty. Sent back for a refund and was initially impressed by the customer service. Finally got the refund, some back to card and some back to voucher.

Purchased another pair also listed as grade A as the customer service rep had given me a bit of faith that it was a one off (plus stuck with ¬£60+ in vouchers) however they arrived and were a different type of headphone to the one pictured (they were the actual hello kitty ones) and covered in stains and marks.

Sent back for a refund which I‚Äôve now received but am stuck with ¬£60+ in Cex vouchers which I now won‚Äôt spend. Guess this is how they make their money?

Only positive from the whole experience was they covered the shipping fee on the returns and postie could pick it up from my doorstep.",0
"Dreadful
We were told the 4 hour period during which our goods would be delivered. 10 minutes before the end of that period we received a call to say it wouldn't

Bought fridge freezer (FF) from them and tried to get FF repaired under policy and kept holding on 3 separate calls for 1 hour each time and got cut off each time. Usless and incompetent and customer service so poor. Have no frdige freezer as we are approaching Xmas and cant even get them out to repair. Dont wase oyur money and go to reparable company that have polices that are worth it. Forced now to buy new one even though I have cover. Would never buy from them Currys again. Bought replacement from AO whose customer are amazing.,0
"Zero stars... this company will steal from you! You order things, you are charged for things but those things you've ordered don't turn up, but they put them on the receipt, then you get in touch with the simpletons at customer service and they won't refund you!

"WARNING DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY

Hundreds of reviews on line same story as me - they take your money, after waiting weeks no phone arrives so you cancel your order and despite numerous dates given over several months you never do get your refund
THEY SIMPLY DO NOT REFUND

I've already explained on the phone with your people,0
"It might claim to have good deals but dealing with this company felt more like dealing with an online scam website than a viable retailer.

They continuously oversell products, so if the product has a 5-7 day lead time this means that they actually don't have it in stock, and probably don't know when they will next have, but they want your custom anyway so pretend they do. This happened to me over Xmas when I tried to buy an iPhone 12 in a specific colour. After calling them they confirmed they didn't actually know when they would get stock in, so after initially changing to another colour, we cancelled the order and had to scrabble to find the product elsewhere in time for Xmas

That was on the 22nd of December and I still haven't had the refund even though the handset (which had shipped) was returned to them at the beginning of Jan . Called them today and was told for some reason the refund had not been automatically applied so they needed to do it manually and this would take another 14 days. This is complete rubbish - standard refunds shouldn't take more than 3-5 working days, so there is no reason why it should take another 14

I'm always suspicious of companies who hold onto your money for longer than they need to, for no specific reason. Looking at other reviews this is something they do regularly. This is what makes the whole experience feel like a scam. They sell products they don't have, then hang onto your money for as long as they can when you cancel.

Anyway my overall advice is avoid. There are good deals elsewhere if you look around and paying a little more probably makes sense in this case and will save a lot of hassle.

Just an update on the above review, despite their post below and promise to contact me I have heard nothing back from Mobile phones direct and still haven't got my money back over two weeks later! What a farce. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID",0

"Would give it zero if I could. Was owed a refund of ¬£270 in September and it is now January with still no refund. I have called on numerous occasions and they claim they can‚Äôt do a bank transfer it has to be a cheque which they‚Äôve sent to my old address not one, not two, not three, but four times now despite me phoning them so many times practically begging them to send it to the correct address this time which they always say they will do yet when I phone again for an update and ask what address it‚Äôs been sent to, they tell me my old address.

Warrenty doesn't seem to mean much.",0
I guess it is fine if you live in the city centre but when you live a little further out of the centre they will suddenly remove all your favorite restaurants when you've been ordering regularly from them for years.

"Our dishwasher is on a 5 year Repair & Support plan that cost ¬£124.99September 4th machine broke and tripped the electricity in the house! Engineer called on 8th and said the machine needed some new parts as the primary circuit board was charred!! As repairs are supposed to be effected within 7 days, according to the policy, or you can request a replacement machine. This is the action I took and Team KnowHow stated that I would receive a voucher, via email, within 7 days. This did not happen and still has not happened, not that I am surprised given the number of people who are experiencing the same refund problem. I have phoned Team KnowHow 6 times to date with a total telephone call duration of 4hr 59 mins 58 secs. My last call on 13th October I was told that a voucher had been sent to my email address and when I queried on what date I was informed that is was either 28th, 30th Sept or 2nd October. This is clearly not true as the Service Agent could not specify the exact date. The Service Agent has now suggested that it be sent to me via SMS and I now await receipt of this via this method. I have also written to their CEO, Alex Baldock, twice and received an automated response to the initial email and no reply to the second email, again no surprise. In this day and age of computerisation I find it hard to believe that a company of this nature are unable to provide a decent and satisfactory customer service and to satisfy their legal obligations as laid out in their Customer Support Agreement. I am currently trying the route of a Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act to get my money back. Failing that then I intend to go down the Small Claims Court route.",0
"I'm so disappointed in the service from Team Knowhow. I've finally after weeks of chasing received my device, but shocked to find that the device has been damaged! When they collected the Soundbar and Subwoofer, they where in perfect condition, be it, had an internal fault. But there was no damage to them.
As soon as I opened up the package today I noticed several significant dents in the Soundbar and Subwoofer (Which got replaced! - The Subwoofer didn't even have a problem with it).
I believe like they just dumped some old, pre-used, replacement to me instead of my original device.
This company is an absolute joke - I will never recommend purchasing anything with Team Knowhow.
- And Ryan, please don't send me a generic response. It's as much of a joke as your company.",0

"Dysfunctional, appalling customer service. Over last 9 months, have had 2 major CS issues with Vodafone. Problem 1 - fibre broadband install: 7 months to resolve - 57 hours over 62 phone calls / 17 chats / 44 emails. (compensation ¬£200 for poor service forced on them by CISAS). Problem 2 - loss of business mobile voice services, voicemail, wifi calling for last 7 days. This time spent 19 hours on calls, 7 hours on chats, 2 x1 hour in a shop and we have made no progress whatsoever. All the call centre staff we have come across are very poorly trained and unskilled in communication; they are polite, inexperienced and don't listen, parroting scripts and false empathy. They fob you off at any opportunity and appear totally hamstrung by appalling systems which makes contacting them difficult and escalating any issue very near impossible. The exception is the manager of our local store who was very helpful and sympathetic, but is not empowered to resolve our issues. Nothing is joined up. Even worse try and lodge a complaint and CS refuse to put you through saying they have to fix the problem (which they cant fix!), before you can raise a complaint. Perverse . DO NOT choose Vodafone if you expect any quality of service once an issue arises. As for the social edia teams response - some of use avoid suing facebook and Twitter - some people dont even have them. how about an easily accessable direct telephone number to complaints - revolutionary !!?",0

"**Three ,you KEEP getting poor reviews for your abysmal service via your advisors-wake up and smell the coffee**
After 45 minutes I finally managed to get a phone upgrade from Three.
Took ages though, and I got a lot of Ummm's from the customer service advisor.
What should have taken no more than ten minutes dragged out, as the advisor had to keep going off call to I assume take advice.
This is what happens when you have your call centre abroad and not in the UK, using the cheapest untrained labour.
UK call centres are far above the standard of foreign ones and take a fraction of the time to sort the call.
So Three are wasting money employing poorly trained advisors, as they will I assume need to employ 3 advisors for the likes of say 1 BT advisor.
When will these companies learn.

UPDATE - NO CALL BACK, NO REFUND. CAN'T BELEAVE THEY ARE STILL HOLDING ON TO MY MONEY. JUST WANT A REFUND AS ALREADY BOUGHT A REPLACEMENT TV. NEVER GOING TO SHOP AT CURRYS AGAIN",0
I purchased an expensive induction hob and paid for a 5 year warranty. The hob was installed by a joiner and electrician and when he went to fit the extractor unit it was broken. The hob has also stopped working. It is less than a month old. They want us to return the appliance so I‚Äôm going to have to pay an electrician and joiner to remove it and then install the new one. Shocking customer service.,0

"Actual joke of a company. Signed up for a new year deal, they managed to get my name, DoB, and postcode wrong. When they tried to deliver the phone to the store, it was closed and sent back, and I've spent 2 weeks trying to get a new one, to finally be told ""no we won't send it"". AVOID.",0
I ordered on 19/12/2021 and should have had my product delivered on 22/12/2021.

"BT service is diabolical.
I have been trying to get my 86 year old parents landline connected since 9th September 2021. Two engineers later, two orders later, (because you made the excuse the first one failed) and 20 day on and we are still waiting!!!
We were promised connection today 29.09.21. It has not happened.
Two weeks ago I was assured that I would receive a phone call from the BT ‚Äòwelfare team‚Äô Because my elderly parents have mobility problem.
The BT welfare team didn‚Äôt even have the decency to call as promised!
So far we have waited 20 days over the initial connection date. I have phoned BT 7 times, each time for around 40 mins but still no joy.

"Do not use this company!! I did for 10 years. After my last visit in store and upgrading I will not use them again. We compare, you save is not what this company does. Went in to store a few days after taking out upgrade and complained they did not find me the best deal. They said they would honour 14 day cooling off period (after speaking to manager on phone) but had to wait until manager was back in store. When I went back they said they wouldn‚Äôt honour it. Waste of time! I have been in contact with customer services, the store I upgraded with and regional manager, and all they can say is sorry we can‚Äôt do anything and insisted I was not offered 14 day cooling off period. If you really do find a good deal get it either online or over the phone as they offer 14 day cooling off period and have all information at hand if you need to make a complaint. Also if you are happy to wait until end of contract (which I was but was pushed to upgrade that day) open a new contract - they offer better deals- which is not what they offer you in store. Very upsetting that they don‚Äôt care about their loyal customers!",0

"I won‚Äôt be buying from Currys again- absolutely shocking, team know how? More like team know nothing.

I ordered a fridge freezer in store that was out of stock, we were promised a phone call to tell us when the item would be delivered... the phone call never came. I then phoned currys/ team know how to find out and they said ‚Äúoh yes it‚Äôs due on Thursday‚Äù. They then told me it would likely be afternoon- I made arrangements for someone to be in. I then received a text message last night at 8.13pm (13minutes after their phone lines closed and so preventing me from phoning to rearrange/speak to anyone) telling me that they would deliver between 7.50am-11.50am. Clearly this is not the afternoon. I then phoned them this morning at 8am - the person on the phone told me that they would send a message to the deliverer... they also mentioned that I hadn‚Äôt paid for an afternoon slot so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôd been given the morning, I replied that at no point had I been offered to pay for a time slot (which I would have). The guy delivered it as i managed to get someone there- we paid for installation as it needs to be plumbed, the deliverer refused to do it as the woman in store had wrongly put the installation down as door removal (which isn‚Äôt needed). Poor customer service, clueless staff that don‚Äôt seem to communicate and even poorer communication with customers. I have now been offered an installation time tomorrow between 1pm-5pm, once again causing an inconvenience... really really poor!

"Have been a TT customer for a couple of years now and never had an issue however I am now trying to upgrade to full fibre now that it is available in my area. This process has been a complete disaster from the very beginning.

The ""customer service"" agents that I have dealt with have all been utterly incompetent (I was misquoted a monthly cost, lied to about upgrade fees, lied to about my install date, equipment wasnt sent) The first call to upgrade took well over an hour and a half and more than half of that time I was on hold while the rep sorted one mistake after another.

I get my install date and am promised a price and am promised that there is not an upgrade fee only to get an email a week or so later (a few days before my install date) telling me my install was actually happening almost 4 weeks later!!! Livid I called up yet again and spent roughly 2 hours being passed around between 4 different departments only to be told the initial appointment was never booked to begin with! It also appears that the apparently ""waved"" upgrade fee (which should never have been there to begin with) wasnt the ¬£30 I was told (and was refunded for) but is actually ¬£60!

Fast forward to a week before my install date and I still have no equipment, the Openreach engineer REQUIRES this in order to complete the install (according to an email from Openreach themselves). So yet again I have to contact Talk Talk, I spent more than 3 hours trying to get to someone who could actually answer the question around my equipment delivery and even then they were unable to advise anything except 3-5 working days for delivery.

This has been an utter disgrace from the very first call to upgrade, I am now in serious doubt if I will progress with this (or if it will even happen considering I dont have my equipment yet!) I am completely and utterly disgusted with the woefully bad service throughout this whole shambles.

AVOID!!!!!

22/08/22 Edit following reply: I have now spent over 6 hours trying to resolve this debacle (no I'm not being hyperbolic) today I submitted a formal complaint as I STILL have no equipment and my install is due tomorrow. TalkTalk website has been down all day and I have called through twice (4hrs apart) to be told their systems are also all down so they cant help me (thanks for letting me wait 15mins to be told that). Do yourself a favour and avoid this lot, its not worth it.",0

Incompetent. Useless and sheer incredible bad service. My Girlfriend moved out of a property in August. She gave them a meter reading.

"So bad things do come in threes. Firstly very rude and aggressive tv wall installation service who did not install to specification and left a loose bracket. I complained and arranged for a correction the following week. Nobody showed up and I did not get a call but the job was declared complete on the track it website. I missed my sons football match to ensure I was home. I complained again and they arranged a third visit the following weekend. Again I missed my sons football match. This time I got a call 50 mins before the end of the 4 hour slot telling me they would not come as the driver had reached his time limit. Absolutely fuming !!! Will go into Currys PC world tomorrow to ask for a refund so I can get a professional outfit to install my TV.

Thanks for the response Ryan. You (not you personally but your company) had 3 opportunities to resolve this and failed on all 3 occasions. I have now received my refund.

Spoke to their customer service advisor who took 30 minutes to confirm that there was an issue with the network even though (based on twitter) hundreds of people were having the same issue during the hours leading up to this. Took ages to log into my account because their website has various versions and it‚Äôs not clear which version of the website is the right one to log into. Finally managed to login and then checked the network status on my account page of their website and it said ‚Äúcheck back in a few days‚Äù.

"For the last 25 years I used almost all the fly-by-night so-called internet services providers in the UK and found them all craps. Most of them merely taken over the paperwork from the previous provider if you transfer your services in from another of the many rubbish providers.

I experienced poor services, poor connections, dishonesty in the promised bandwidth compared to what I actually got. And not to mention the overcharging. If you complain, they would say they have investigated the complaint. But never found to be at fault. Effectively, the so-called investigation was just a theoretical exercise in keeping with the requirements of the regulator (Ofcom dot Org Dot UK). All because the so-called Regulator is ineffective. One of this ineffectiveness resulted from the fact that they can only investigate complain if the company is a member of Ofcom.

Having had so many bad experiences with previous providers, I start using NowTV in 2019. The service was reliable up to earlier this year when the company sought to double its monthly price from the ¬£25.00 I was paying to include unlimited national phone calls and unlimited broadband to ¬£40.00 monthly. But when I told the company that I cannot afford to pay ¬£40.00 per month and will not be continuing with the service if it insists with doubling my monthly price, the company resorted to extremely dishonest tactics to force its new charges on me and to tie me into a 12 months contract as oppose to the 30 days rolling arrangement I had entered into with the company.

You would have thought an honest provider would have tried to negotiate with me in an effort to keep my custom. Instead, the company billed my account for two months in arrears at the increased monthly price of ¬£40.00 with several of the company‚Äôs staff taken turns to lie finding all sort of reasons as to why I am owing the alleged debt. When this wasn‚Äôt working, the company then claimed that I accepted the new terms to pay the increased ¬£40.00 per month because they are terms which are included in the company‚Äôs terms and conditions of services which I allegedly accepted when I opened the account in 2019, a suggestion I found totally bizarre.

Sometimes it pays to be mindful of the rules, guidelines and regulations that apply to the service you are buying. Sadly, there are also a bewildering number of laws and regulations that can be extended to cover broadband, mobile and or phone ‚Äúservices‚Äù, such as the Consumer Credit Act or Consumer Contracts Regulations (distance Selling Regulations). Please have a look at (ISPREVIEW DOT CO DOT UK) for details as to how some of the relevant rules apply.

The rules and guidelines of the Advertising Standard Authority also apply and are implied terms of your contract with the internet services provider. Accordingly, you must bear in mind that low speed, for example, is an automatic breach of contract by the provider which entitles you to seek to bring any long term contract to an end without any penalty to you. Particularly, where the company is in breach of contract, they must put you in the same position as if there was no breach on your part with you not have to make any further payment or continue to use the company products. A further example, lets say you had a 24 months contract with ‚Äúdot internet‚Äù, but dot internet failed to provide the promised speed. You contact the company in writing retaining proof of communications. But dot internet ignored and or the low speed continues without improvements. That would be a clear breach of contract by dot internet entitling you to terminate the contract and bring it to an end. The company‚Äôs debt to you, to say the least, would be the payments due for the remainder of months you would have had to pay the company had they not breached the contract of service.

NOWTV recent huge monthly increase in it phone and broadband package is more to do with the company dishonest attempts to charge customers for TV channels, most of which are free TV channels available with the five main UK channels and their affiliated channels but nothing to do with improvement in the internet broadband and phone services customers contracted with the company for. This in my view makes NOWTV the most dishonest phone and broadband services I have used in the UK so far.",0
"I‚Äôve been billed ¬£64.50 per month over what was agreed at the start of the contract. Each time I have called to resolve the response has been that it has been fixed, yet it wasn‚Äôt. When I 1st submitted a written complaint at the end October I received no response and checking back a few weeks later the complaint has disappeared. Write to complain again and Virgin ask me to send them a copy of their contract, not addressing the compliant or resolving (complete laziness). Call up about said written complaint and finally speak to someone in the UK. Since May we have overpaid over ¬£450, they have now calculated as ¬£350 and applied a credit to bills.

"EE recommended we switch to BT, for a faster speed and good price. Wish we never bothered.

Switch was due to happen on Monday, new hub was sent out the Thursday before this on a 2 day service. It hasn‚Äôt arrived.
Currently WiFi is half working on the EE hub.
Called BT and EE on Wednesday to find out what was going on. Neither could offer a solution to fix the WiFi as it was and said I‚Äôd need to wait for a hub.
First hub hadn‚Äôt moved on tracking since the day it was sent, so they sent a new one.
New one has still not arrived. Again, sent on a 2 day service, which seems bizarre considering we have already complained and not received the original hub.
Again, looking at the tracking, the second hub doesn‚Äôt seem to have moved either.
Due to arrive tomorrow, not convinced it will.
BT were supposed to give us a follow up call today, have not heard from them.
Been switched 4 days and wish we hadn‚Äôt bothered.

Hi,

Thanks for leaving a review.

I'm really sorry to read that your refund has not been processed yet, despite the cancellation of your repair and care plan in December.

It goes without saying that this is far from the level of service we expect to be providing our customers, so I do sincerely apologise about this.

Your feedback is important to us. Your comments will be passed on to the relevant department and taken on board.

If you need any further help please do get in touch. You can call us or contact us via Facebook and Twitter:


Thank you,

"Worst Customer Service Ever! There are some excellent staff here that are helpful but they are let down by inconsiderate and patronising service of some employees! They fixed the TV then damaged it in transit on way back to me! The guys took the tv out of the box in the rain and then carried into my house and leaned it screen first against a wall. It was broken when I turned it on.

Sent back gain and it‚Äôs taken over a week just to produce a voucher! That still isn‚Äôt here yet or in my email box! The care support staff are useless! I have to go through to the Tech team all the time to get any sense!

This lady was on loud speaker and ignored my requests and has now placed me on hold for 20 mins as I write this. Then she has hung up!

I have never experienced such incompetence in my life.

Contact me as soon as possible team know how! You have an official complaint coming",0

Where do you start placed an orderer broadband back in February had 7 yes 7 engineers turn up at my house to try and fit fibre all of them contractors. Still no connection only to be told by a jerk at the call centre that I should be great full that 7 vans have been to my house its a sign that BT are serious in the work that they do and it costs between ¬£5 and ¬£10k to fit each fibre cable. At one point I thought I was on Ant and Decks Saturday takeaway with the ridiculous things he was saying. Staff away don't use,0
"I received a call to my mobile off 02045382633 from a male offering me a deal on an iPhone 14. He had a foreign accent and was hard to understand so what he was offering was difficult to understand in the first place.

I advised him I wasn't interested to which he replied 'you broke my heart' in a singing voice!!! I laughed and replied I'm in business and wouldn't talk to a customer that way, it's unprofessional. I then ended the call.

If this chap was indeed calling on behalf of Vodafone what this says about the sales training they provide their staff and their attitude as a company leaves much to be desired. Rather than making me think of Vodafone next time I change my mobile phone it actually puts me off them.",0

"PCSpecialists sold me laptop with broken motherboard. I didn't get any help and instructions on how to confirm the MB problem.

Three months later I've start refund procedure as I couldn't wait any longer. It supposed to be my everyday working device. During the refund I was asked to pay for the power supply and part of the chasses as they were faulty.

It was my second purchase with PCS and I think I will not trust this company any longer.

PCS decided to not ship me the ""faulty patrs"" after they charged me for them.
PCS is thinking I'll donate to them laptop 230W PS. I would like to add that I have photos of the laptop and PS and it has been fully working in the day I have shipped them. As well after laptop has been shipped they didnt inform me about any faulty parts.
Story is getting bigger...
At the beginning I thought it is just a problem with MB of my laptop to be shipped to PCS. Now the company is prooving that theirs castomer service is very bad. I'm not sure I've seen so bad customer service anyware else.",0

"Very disappointed. I ordered 2 parts for a breadmaking machine. Having only received 1 item I found the other item was out of stock. I was told that they could not confirm an expected delivery date. After 6 weeks I was told I would have to wait a further 4 to 6 weeks. I sourced the item elsewhere and then cancelled the order. This was not straightforward. In the FAQ it explained you could cancel by phone or by email to customer service. Interestingly the email form drop down menu had no option to cancel the order. This had to be completed to proceed so I chose the complaint heading instead and explained that I wanted to cancel. A refund is now meant to be coming. I won't use this company again as all other online shops tell you if the item is not in stock, rather than take your money and you find out later when it's not delivered.

I have sent back all the equipment they request. Sent smart hub and receive confirmation from BT months after. Sent smart hub 2 and hybrid about 2 or 3 months ago and they charged me extra ¬£116.00 on top of my regular bill. Copied and pasted bellow:

"" Other charges¬£116.00
You've got some extra charges this month
Your regular charges
Paper bill fee22 Oct¬£3.00
One-off charges
This is the charge for non return of your Hybrid Connect20 Oct ¬£63.00
This is the charge for non return of your Smart Hub 220 Oct ¬£50.00""

I called BT they said they do not have my return yet but if they receive it they will refund the money.
IT IS NOT POINT!!!
How BT can just add all this extra charge when they are not competent enough neither can cope with the number of return equipment check in time. And just add it to your bill and will refund God knows when.

I was on the phone with BT for over 90 min going from one person to another and every thing one was rude and unhelpful with a superior attitude like the customer is worthy nothing.
Now I will have to endure hours with CAB, letters, Ombudsman service, etc... to sort it out.
And get a way to end BT contract and move on.

BT and its staff belongs to the devil.
DO NOT JOIN BT AND AVOID ITS EVIL WAYS.

I have sent a message on Facebook yesterday as Mandy from BT (bellow) has advised.
No one even replied.

Anyway, I went to my local post office where I posted the parcel and luckily they help me. Called BT and gave proof of posting number. The BT staff checked the number and it was okay. Now BT already sent me and email saying:

Thanks for returning your kit
Hello Nudia,

Just to confirm, we've got:
Hybrid Connect
Smart Hub 2


Your return has helped us with our commitment to reduce waste. We'll now make sure this kit is either recycled or disposed of in a safe and environmentally friendly way.

Thanks,

This company is a bunch of fraudsters and should be closed down NOW! For all customers not getting refunds, go to your bank ""online credit or debit card disputes"" and ask the bank to get your money back.

"SHOCKING SERVICE. Placed an order on 11th May, phone was passed to tech on 19th May. On 1st June I asked for an update as I had heard nothing yet. On 5th June I still had no update and despite several facebook messages and tweets, I had no answers.
Slow service, terrible customer service and NO phone repaired.
This will be taken further and full actions will be taken if I do not receive my fixed phone or an ¬£80 refund and the broken phone back.

UPDATE - 09/06/20.
Received the response from this review, saying to email customer service. Which I had already done along with the numerous social media messages. Received an email yesterday saying my phone was being posted back today. GREAT! Progress, I was finally going to have my phone back. The phone just arrived now at 10.30am. Opened up the package and it HAS NOT BEEN FIXED. No refund. No notice of it being returned broken. Absolutely disgusting. The lack of customer service truly is astonishing, to send back the broken phone and not issue a refund is ridiculous.

UPDATE - 01/07/20.
After several emails sent, all I kept receiving was a generic response of refunds take 14 working days and the account manager would be in contact. A week later and still nothing, the time frame is now over 14 working days and I have NO refund. More than annoyed with this company now as holding my ¬£80 is absurd, especially when it's a lot of money and there is NO reason for the delay when I have the broken phone in my possession and no service has been carried out.

Also infuriating to have a reply to this review to email the customer service team, yet I get nothing but a basic generated response back and make no progress.",0

"We had a 6 year Warranty and our TV developed a fault. We were advised by Ashley within Customer Service that the TV was not repairable and offered us a voucher towards a new tv, which would not cover anywhere near the cost of a replacement tv. When Ashley was advised of the terms and conditions of the 6 year warranty stating a 'like for like' replacement Ashley advised as our TV is no longer made, he would look on Ebay for a second-hand TV as a replacement. Eventually, after Ashley was advised of Consumer Rights and the law, he changed his mind and we were offered a 'like for like' replacement.

"Seriously lousy.
Thought I would try the service after some months and surprise surprise, nothing has changed infact it has probably got worse. Firstly NOW has lost some channels and in order to lessen the blow they've added Kids into entertainment. Why that wasn't originally the case it beyond belief.

I can also now see that they've introduced ADVERTS into this paid-for service?!? And then have the cheek to charge an addition ¬£5 so that I don't have to get ads shoved down my throat. No thanks!!! Which other streaming service only allows streaming on only ONE device?!?

720p streaming quality is pathetic, it's not even industry standard to offer such a lousy stream quality - how can NOW be featured amongst the top service?

Removing features that existed before and moving them behind another paywall is not the way to do sustainable business, infact I will not be surprised if your subscriptions fall of a cliff!

Save your time, effort and sanity and just go with Prime Video and discovery+.",0
"2+ year long nightmare. If you thinking of going to Vodafone for a contract (or anything else), you need to take a cold shower and reconsider. Despite paying for the fastest 5G package, in 2 years I never even got 4G despite frequently travelling around the UK. If I am lucky enough to get a response to this, they will probably reply to this and claim I wasn't in an area covered by 5G as they don't seem to really read or listen to complaints but like I said I didn't even get 4G. I am now on PAYG with another service provider using the SAME iPhone and get perfect 4 and 5G so despite HOURS on the phone over 2 years and speaking to their stupid Tobi robot they still couldn't sort it out. It gets better...when I gave them a heads up I wasn't renewing (for obvious reasons) and confirmed I wanted them to cancel my contract they never did and I've had to phone about 10 times over the last 2 months to try get this resolved. It looks like they have FINALLY managed to cancel my contract and I was offered a whopping ¬£40 refund despite over paying ¬£1000+ for 5G when all I ever got was 3G. This company is absolutely useless - no reason to take a contract out nowadays - You can get a new iPhone through Apple interest free for ¬£30 quid a month and then pay an additional ¬£10 a month on PAYG (with anyone but Vodafone of course) for 20GB data, free minutes and texts, no lock in to a contract. Vodafone can get in the bin. So glad I am free from their rubbish mobile and customer service. üñïüñïüñï",0

"I went into the Salford branch, where two members of staff from carphone warehouse or looking at women on their phones. I picked a phone and I was told it wasn't in stock but I had to pay for it now and pick it up tomorrow. I left the shop and got a call from someone saying they had already bought a similar phone. I went back into the shop the next day and said I want my money back. I haven't even received the item, a man called Manny was extremely rude and somewhat racist towards me, to be nice to an Asian lady who was stood before me and looked me up and down like I was white trash.

You told me that terms and conditions stated you are not able to get a refund,after arguing the point out that I hadn't actually received the phone no did I agree to any terms and conditions I wanted a full refund. I left the phone in the shop and called up carphone warehouse over 11 times, no one helped. I was promised a call back from the area manager and haven't received that. I will never be using carphone warehouse and I certainly won't be going into Currys PC world because they support is horrendous organisation and behaviour from staff members.",0

"Get equipment on the 29th, try to set it up but it's non functional however it activated the services (and billing of course), upon many calls to virgin I finally managed to get it to work 8 hours later, I enjoy 24 hours of internet to then get cut off again for 24 hours, get it working again and have 24 hours of intermittent signal (comes and goes every 10 minutes), got fixed so I enjoyed maybe 24 hours of a slower than normal experience. Then it went down, and it's been down for 72 hours. Virgins response is let's book you an engineer, 1 week from now. I rejected and requested cancellation to which they said ok and passed me on to retentions, however they booked in the rejected date as if it had been accepted. Fast forward and I've spent 2 hours in the last 2 days speaking to this retention department with the following results:

1st call - very polite and apologetic and confirmed I wouldn't pay any fees for the first month due to bad experience, also confirmed my cool down period could be extended as a result and I would get it in writing (all I got in writing was that I accepted the 1 week from now date and complaint was closed)

2nd call - don't think this person knew what they were doing, apart from being condescending and rude they kept me on hold for 20 minutes and hanged up!!!!!! (45 minutes lost in total)

3rd call - person was a lot more helpful but was clearly trying to get rid of me, I was promised a call back in 10 minutes, it's now been 30 minutes.

Overall would never ever recommend virgin to anyone in any background or budget, horrible experience and I've had service for 4 days out of the 9 I've had it for, long wait times for engineers, whenever there's an issue all you will get told is wait 24 hours.

Edit 12/01/22:

After many more calls and backwards and forwards with virgin, the engineer wait time did not change, the broadband worked for 1 day in the last 5 days and then according to their own staff and app they have deactivated my account/services for two days until the engineer arrives, not even the call centre could tell me the reason why as quote on quote ""it doesn't make any sense"". (I have recorded this call and informed the agent and I'm seriously considering posting it online so people have a sample of the ""quality service you can expect from virgin"".

Just a heads up for anyone reading this even though I was in my cooling off period and tried to cancel I was first told I needed to pay a disconnection fee (poor staff training) and after that hurdle I've been told I need to wait and pay an additional 30 days of service to get disconnected (on a non working broadband)",0
"After 18 months of hell being with VM, I was finally able to switch providers (yay).
At end of contract you‚Äôre advised to send the hub back in the pre-paid packaging, otherwise you‚Äôre charged ¬£40. Naturally I requested the packaging to be sent to me, which never came‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Thus ensued a barrage of threatening emails and texts (from VN) saying I hadn‚Äôt sent the hub back, so will be charged. But if I would like to request pre-paid packaging please click a link. I clicked this link at least 8 times. No packaging turned up.
Finally rang them (a lovely waste of an hour), whereby I explained the situation. The customer service guy said he would send out packaging (again) and would detail this on my account, to ensure I‚Äôm not charged. Nice hey? HE DID NO SUCH THING. I‚Äôve just received a bill which includes the ¬£40 charge. Had to ring them again for them to not be able to help. I‚Äôm just glad I cancelled the direct debit, which I‚Äôm hoping means they can‚Äôt just take my money (like they have in the past).

"Just got a call from the agent who tried to give me awful upgrade choices previously where I decided to just keep my current phone, not upgrade and go onto a cheaper plan. The agent told me I've been chosen as a valued customer, I'm being sent ¬£150 in the post and a free alcatel smart phone. He then offered to read through transcripts & mentioned a 24 month contract. I asked if this was a new contract I was being signed upto. Turned out it was. So its not im a valued customer and getting a free gift, he was just getting me to sign into a new contract in a very sly way. I told him straight up I knew what he was doing, it doesn't give me faith I can trust the company any more. I'll take my business elsewhere in future.

Ontop of this, since originally posting this review a week ago, carphone warehouse has continually tried to contact me, 3 times a day. Apparently regarding the upgrade which I told them I was not interested in. What is it called if someone says no to something, but the other party does not take no for an answer? Harrassment. I will be cancelling the current contract this week so I don't have to deal with these nuisance calls. If you had just listened to me when I said I am happy on my current contract.",0
"So where do i start, i was due an upgrade on my phone contract and therefore i went online and ordered my new one with Carphone Warehouse. A day later my phone was delivered only to then realise they had taken out a second contract for the phone and not upgraded the contract i already had. So I then had to physically return this phone to the shop to them whilst a second phone was ordered and delivered as an upgrade on my original contract. When I took the first phone back into the shop to return to them they then ended up cancelling my second phone order by mistake so I then had to get my second phone which had already been delivered by this point and physically return this one to the shop as well!!! Nightmare!!! At this point i was then told by Carphone Warehouse i could not ordered another phone as of yet and had to wait 3-5 days because the system was showing me as already upgraded (even though they had cancelled this). By the time i came to ordering my third phone with Carphone Warehouse the tariff i had originally chosen on the first and second phone was no longer available and the only tariffs available on the network and phone i wanted were dearer and cost more. At this point i am livid and refusing to pay more than what i wanted as this is there error and not mine. Eventually Carphone Warehouse agreed that if i get the higher tariff they will refund me the difference of what i was going to pay. This worked out that Carphone Warehouse are to refund me ¬£240. They advised me to stay in my contract 30 days with the new phone and then they will send the money to me. It has now been nearly 2 months or more and i still haven't received the ¬£240 refund they owe me. I have been on the phone to them countless times and each time i am lied to and fobbed off. I have been told on more than one occasion that a cheque has been raised for me when it turns out it actually hasn't, i have been told i will have to wait a further 14-28 days for the cheque which i have advised is not acceptable and not willing to accept as i have already waited well over 30 days or more and i have also been told that instead they have now authorised a bank transfer for me straight to my bank and i should receive this by the end of the week. Surprise surprise still no money!!! This is an absolute joke!!! What an absolute shabby, fraudulent, thieving company. If i do not get my money within the next 24hours i will be making sure this goes higher than just a trust pilot review and i will take it to every Ombudsman interested and any Newspaper interested in your fraudulent and dodgy ways!!!",0
NOW TV make it very easy to take your money but when you have an issue they have made it perfectly impossible to get help. They have debited ¬£33.99 for the Sports channel which I never watch.

"Horrible store manager at Westfield carphone warehouse white city.

I lost my phone two weeks ago (always been a carphone warehouse customer) so I went to the carphone warehouse store to check my options for a new phone. The store manager sold me a lie( still fine). I picked up an S10. And then I found my old phone a couple of days later luckily. I tried to return this new contract which btw you can return it as long as it is within 14days and in good condition. First, the store manager lied to me about return policy telling me I can't return it. Then he goes missing for a couple of days (all to waste the 14days window to return the phone). When I caught up with his lies about the return policy, he starts telling the phone is not in good condition. WHAT A JOKE! mind you, the phone is perfect condition. I barely used it.

I have had a similar experience to other reviewers in trying to cancel my NOW tv pass. It is impossible to do on the website and there is only a robot incapable of dealing with issues. I have wasted hours of my life trying to cancel my pass before stopping the payments from my bank. This did not work. They are using my card details to continue taking money from my account.

"I purchased a Samsung Fridge Freezer on 11th November 2022 for ¬£1049, with delivery promised for 6th December 2022. My credit card was debited immediately for the full amount.

Since purchasing the item, Argos continued to send me polite reminders via email and text throughout November and early December that the delivery was taking place on the agreed date.

Yesterday, 5th December 2022 at 15:20, the day before delivery, I received a text message, exactly reproduced below:

""Hello, we're sorry to let you know due to a system issue order 254100034 has been cancelled. If you Want the item(s), please place a new order"".

The value of the item has now been increased to ¬£1600, so it's quite obvious that Argos is playing a game on the price.

I wonder what the Sainsbury's Chief Executive, who has recently received a ¬£3.8M pay package, would do if he was remotely treated like this?

Also, to make it clear, at no time did I ever attempt to cancel this order either online or verbally, so, as far as I'm concerned, it's still open and active.

"Further to my last Trust Pilot review of the 11th Oct 2022. I sent this further email to TalkTalk CEO on the 30th of December I have had no reply.

Dear Tristia Harrison (Ben Thompson),

Further to your last email. I inform you that due to my Aunt having no TalkTalk telephone or TV service for such a long time and a 98yr olds complete reliance for medical help on a working telephone, once you finally restored her telephone she was medically in such a poor condition that Doctors and Nurses convinced her that due to being not able to call for medical help, her medical condition had so drastically deteriorated that she was rushed to hospital and died on the 7th November 2022.

So, from an active 98yr old living alone in mid-September due to no telephone/TV etc, her health deteriorate so much that she was rushed to hospital once her TalkTalk telephone/internet service was repaired and died in early November.

What did TalkTalk do after being contacted dozens of times, they kept on taking money for a service that they did not supply even taking money out of her account the day after she died and despite being told more than once that she was dead, we have again received today a bill payment due next year two months after her death for a TalkTalk telephone/internet/TV service to a house that has been empty since October.

Please can I have a reply as I have so many people following this never-ending Saga.",0

I bought a phone from carphone warehouse for my grandmother. The sim card reader didn't work in phone and I tested with different sim cards and it didn't work. I went in to get a replacement and the sales assitant charged me for the replacementt which should have been free as the mobile phone has been faulty since I got.My grandmother never used the phone. The staff were like it's not my problem and I complained to the customer service and same thing again not my problem. I will be warning friends and other members of family not to use this terrible company,0
"Bought a Motorola G50 in October. Just 7 weeks later the earpiece microphone/speaker does not work. Took it back to Currys for help/advice.

To this day I get a monthly bill and I have received a letter from a debt collection agency. I have called and done online chats and they say that I need to cancel my contract! Then they ask me to call back to make sure it has been cancelled and it keeps going round and round like this with nothing being done and I have yet another emailed bill this month. What is it going to take to get rid of the disgusting company?",0
Do not I repeat do not use carphone warehouse potteries hanley absolutely disgusted with what they did to my friend we went in looking force straightforward upgrade on ee was conned into taking out another contract they basically triangulated (illegal) btw his phone so that sam could earn his commission my friend ended up with 2 contracts and 2 Bill's he suffers from severe anxiety this was most distressing and when he tried to return the phone they kept fobbing him off. I returned to store with him in which sam then lied to our faces and said he had made him aware of what he was doing HE did not. We then had to phone customer services who dont speak good english and were passed from pillar to post by this time my friends having a panic attack üò° fortunately my sister runs a mobile shop down south so called her she told me about Ofcom and vulnerability app I went back to the store and threatened to go to them and they took the phone back sam however hid out the back of the shop (pathetic) lying conman. So do not use them or be conned into what u think is a cheaper deal stick to your provider or go to another provider they are a 3rd party provider who will exploit vulnerable people and break Ofcom regulations for commission.

"This is quite unbelievable. My mother is 99 years old and took out a maintainence cover plan probably 10 years ago. The annual fee was paid every year on a automatic renewal payment basis. Yesterday my mother rang to arrange for some repair work. She was treated with no respect, very rudely and told that her cover had expired as she had no paid her current years premium! This had always been automatically renewed but the customer service person was emphatic that is was her fault not to have picked up that it had not been paid and put the phone down. This would be a great phone call to play back and listen to. The man on the phone should be ashamed of himself.

"do not recommend. Personalized item ordered as a gift, meant to be delivered after 5-7 days. only after placing the order message on the account appeared it will be delivered in up to 28 days. But guess what, after that time item is still not delivered! After asking them (because of course no one bothered to email you to let you know about delays) they still can't tell me WHEN the item will be ready for dispatch.
After requesting the refund they tell that ""Unfortunately, I am sorry to inform you that we are unable to cancel the order. As the items are personalised to your requirements, we are only able to accept back the non-personalized items.""

Now - don't let yourself be fooled - that practice is illegal. If the item was not delivered in promised time they must refund you. So I said that if they won't refund me I will raise with my payment provider for a refund (so called dispute). So now the are telling me they will cancel but refund money to the Studio account, so I have to spend with them again.

Absolutely unreliable company (this is not my first time with similar issue with them) with a horrible customer service.

Do yourself a favor and order somewhere else. You may think you will save a few ¬£ with them but in the end you have no product and you will spend weeks trying to get it sorted.

"Today, I finally managed to leave BT.

A 2 year contract with my mobile. My reception, according to BT and EE would be perfect. The issue was that the local BT mast has never worked properly, there are constant issues with it and so every conversation in my house or town is always poor.

Technicians recommended turning btwifi calling on. (And I have bt wifi in house) but this barely helped because if I move from one room to another while on phone then it breaks up.

I have phoned bt, spoken to people who can barely hear me, are telling me that they can tell there is an issue, however, because the computer says there are no issues in my area then there is nothing that they can do.

Absolute joke. My daughters phone is with them but she barely phones anyone so it's fine for her but I'll be cancelling that in next week or so when that runs.

My wifi is also with then which has been ok but the service I've had with them and the way they essentially say 'you've signed a 2 year deal so tough' has made me want to cut all ties.

"Do not use for business. 10 days into services, I sent the below email to the upper echelons of BT...and, we're still not resolved. I was told to wait and see what happens over the weekend. Ludicrous.

Hi,

I'm sending this to everyone I can find on line. I'm experiencing absolutely exasperating levels of service. Nothing is getting resolved. I work from home, and I've received recently started my own enterprise.

I have taken out a business account, LAST WEEK. And, I'm already needing to raise formal complaints, detailed below.

1. I opened 2 lines on a personal account. But, opened two lines on business the following day. I asked the advise to cancel the former. This didn't happen, so I'm being chased for usage. And making dozens of calls, or chats, only to be constantly transferred to a different department, or even or several occasion, the bloody start menu.

2. I ordered a BT Outdoor 5g hub. For some reason I was sent a ming hub. Which also doesn't work. After several calls and chats, over 2 days, I finally speak to a guy who said I would receive a replacement yesterday. I did not. I'm not currently on my third adviser on chat, just to find out where it is.

3. As I was under the impression that I only had business accounts, I bought my number across from Vodafone. In trying to bring this from personal to business, I absolutely give up. I spoke to AT LEAST 12 people. I need my number brings across from personal to business PAC code from personal BTC742658.

4. Also one I have up on. I need access to BT WiFi Hotspots. I have a username and password. I log into the app, fine. I try and log into WiFi, it keeps saying its incorrect login details. I reset my password. Same thing. Log into app, fine. No access still to hotspots.

5. Chats and calls and absolutely ridiculous. As we speak, I'm onto advisor three, everyone keeps telling me its not their department. This goes for every issue I've experienced. I've made contact AT LEAST two dozen times in ten days. Absolutely nothing has been resolved.

6.
Narender Singh is refusing to give me the complaints email for BT, insisting that the BT support email is where I need to raise a concern.

This is unbelievably poor service, form the countries oldest telephony provider.

I then had three phone calls from a lady called Cathy. As BT still couldn't work out what was happening, I decided to try and make a call myself. 154 being the number for BT business, from a BT handset. I made 5 calls through different options, none of which were directed to BT business. When I finally did get through to the right department, I was told my replacent router wasn't, and isn't in stock. So, it couldn't have been ordered. Cathy then called me back to say that my order is with the warehouse. When I challenged her, asking when the delivery date is, to which she informed me she didn't know. I told her, that's because I've just called and found out that it isn't even on stock. I added that no one even called, or emailed to tell me. It had just been left.

It's just unbelievable. Just really big problems with BT. Way too compartmentalised. Their internal Telephony and communication, needs rebuilding from the bottom up. Ironic for a company that's key services are telephony and communication.

UPDATE ANOTHER WEEK ON

Right,

I'm not playing this game anymore. I've been more than patient. Even when I've out my patience, nothing is resolved. This comedy of errors is ever going. To add, BT tried to take ¬£50 from my account yesterday, of which I will get charges, for the personal account that should have been closed before my business order was even processed.

So...

1 - Get rid of the bills for my personal account.

2 - Please cancel the mobile Internet line, and send me a returns bag for the Outdoor router, as I have now placed an order elsewhere. But, make sure you do not cancel the line attached to my mobile phone, the one of which my number was ported across (07889 630 138).

3 - Please get my hotspot sorted by close of play Monday 19th July. Failure to do so, will result in me cancelling my phone as well.

4 - My bill payment cycle should well start once I have full working services. So, please ensure I am not charged up till that point, and we start will full data from then. As you have not even yet offered compensation, I believe that to be be fair.

I work from home due to Covid and am MD of a company. My broadband stopped working for 2 days in May 21. They sent me a mini hub in the post and got it working again. The same happened in Sept 21. They sent an engineer round who did a test on the router and all his checks. Said it looks like a problem with the copper wire coming into the property that has gets damp periodically. Someone from BT will get back to me in 48 hrs telling me what they are going to do. I heard nothing. 3 weeks went by still nothing. I am therefore in a position when the broadband could go down again and this really affects my ability to work. I therefore took out broadband with another company that provides broadband with a different cabling system at a 300 meg speed. We are now 2 months down the line and I heard nothing from BT. I have given BT opportunities to resolve it but they failed. They have not delivered a consistent service. I called them today and they will not allow me to cancel without paying up for the remaining term of the contract which runs to 14 Oct 2022. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY (BT). I have now started a complaint with them and will seek an alternative phone contract / provider too when that ends. I will speak to Offcom.,0

"I placed an order for fibre broadband on June 29th. An engineer was due to visit July 13th. They did not turn up and I heard nothing from BT. I am self employed and lost a days wage waiting for the engineer. When I chased it up I was told there was an issue and a new date was arranged and for the second time they didn't turn up! Once again I lost a days wage. After numerous phone calls and different excuses it was decided a temporary copper line could be used but my landline was now not working so an engineer would need to visit to fix it first. My 3rd day of loss of earnings as the engineer needed to enter the property. The phone line was fixed after 2 weeks without one. Copper was due to be installed 02/08. Today is the 3rd and the broadband is not working and now the phone line isn't working. I phoned at 8am, spoke to 4 different advisors for over an hour only to be told the fault could possibly be fixed by 06/08! The 3rd advisor was quite rude and sounded half asleep and was very reluctant to help. I have spoken to at least 30 different people at BT since placing my order and told a different story every time with countless promises of someone calling my back and they never do. I am now my 3rd week without internet and once again without a phone line. Had enough now and will be changing suppliers but can't do that until the faults they created are fixed!",0

Crazy considering I was using that phone up untl the day I sent it to them, I never got rid because there was anything wrong with it, I had an upgrade!!! I had no such issues with the phone! It seems crazy to get it returned now as quite possibly damaged in between me sending it to them and them testing!
I have accepted the offer reluctantly, but just want to warn others about this. I went to this company because I thought more reputable afetr being suggested by family.",0

I've never left a bad review for anything in my life before but Carphone Warehouse I feel are running nothing short of a scam and I feel it's appropriate that others do not get caught out by this. They offered me ¬£190 for a trade-in on my old phone against a new contract with a ¬£150 upfront cost. After the two week cancellation period had passed they informed me my phone was now only worth ¬£25 due to screen burn. Lines on the screen from where the menus are. Not an issue caused by the user or the life of the phone. Something that will apply to all phones. They have been quite rude to deal with and I would heavily advise people to avoid them.,0

My husband picked up our land line phone in was crackling. He rang 151 faults. The lady he spoke to explained there was a fault on the line that was also causing the Broadband to drop out. She said Engineers were on their way to fix the problem.
At 11.30 am BT rang on my husband‚Äôs mobile phone. He was told engineers could not come out that day, they had to follow they‚Äôre daily work sheets, so, would be out tomorrow, Saturday if not it would be Monday. However, on Saturday the land line was dead. No engineers appeared.
Today Monday, I texted BT. I got a call from BT, I was informed that an Engineer could be sent out on Wednesday. It seems there is a total lack of communication at BT

Considered switching to this company for my ISP that was when the problems started. First they claimed my present ISP would not transfer the line. I checked they had not even heard from NOW. I was then cut off by their customer service when I was enquiring why I had been told this and before I could finish my question I was transferred to another extension in a department that could not understand why I had been transferred there. Ringing back I eventually spoke to someone who laughed when I told of my experience. I decided to stay with my present ISP and it took four requests before I eventually was told they had cancelled my request. Not really worth even one star.

I applied for a mobile phone contract on 17th December 2019. First it got accepted and i paid ¬£70 upfront deposit from my credit card. My order no was 422274730. But then order got declined. You guys should have refunded my ¬£70 but you didnt bother to. Then i called you many times for refund but NOONE helped me in refund. Every customer rep told me that refund will be there in your account in 3-5 working days. Then a direct debit of ¬£91 was deducted from my bank account on 02 Jan 2020 for this same order which you already declined. Its simple robbery which you did. After that i called again and again and again for my REFUND. But your customer service guys are highly incompetent, unprofessional and mannerless. They are just doing delaying tactics and wasted my time. They again told me that within 3-5 working days, you will get your refund. Its 22nd of Jan now. Its been more than a month now and i dont know WHEN I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK? WHEN THESE 3-5 WORKING DAYS WILL FINISH? 
If you have any iota of shame and if you are not robbers then please REFUND my money (¬£70+¬£91) ASAP...

"The worst experience ever. When I first registered as a student in November last year, I was told that my 12 months contract can be cancelled anytime if my sim is not in use. Now that I‚Äôm Back in my home country, although my sim is not in use, I am forced to pay an outstanding balance of 42¬£, which I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying but I was also told that the contract is for 24 months?!!!! Which means an additional 12 months. And if I were to terminate I have to pay an additional 241¬£ apart from the 42¬£? I was not told about the terminating fee at all when I registered. If I was told and aware of this, I wouldn‚Äôt have subscribed in the first place. What the actual heck? And I got an email immediately saying my payment was transferred to debt collection without even trying to mail me at first regarding the outstanding payment or resolving this. I knew it was a scam from the beginning and I fell for it. Will never ever recommend this service to anyone! To me, 3 seems completely money minded and they just focus on taking money from customers without resolving anything or delivering customers needs/ satisfaction. How can you transfer to the debt collection without emailing/ contacting me about the outstanding fees or resolving with me first. Their customer service is the worst ever.

"Our contract with Virgin Broadband has come to an end and we received a new bill almost doubling our monthly cost. My wife shopped around and found a much better deal with Sky. After installing Sky my wife (the account holder) called Virgin to cancel our account. Easy, right? Wrong! After several attempts we finally got through to an attendant who checked account details and security etc. And then passed us on to another attendant who asked for it all again and then tried to persuade us to stay by offering us increasing discounts, small at first and then major, better than our original value (so far annoying, but fair enough). He insisted on knowing who we had signed up with (we reluctantly told him Sky) and then insisted on knowing how much we were paying. We refused to tell him and he insisted that he had to record this on the cancellation. We insisted that we are under no obligation to disclose this to cancel our contract with Virgin. He kept coming back to this like a stuck record with several pauses to check things on his system in-between. Finally he told us he had to reboot his computer and go through the whole security check process again (3rd time) and finally did it after a marathon call, absolutely exhausting. In my opinion this is a deliberate strategy (I have seen other posts with very similar experiences). Absolutely despicable business practice - a simple sorry to see you go would have at least let us leave on friendly terms. Now I will never go back to Virgin or recommend them to anyone.",0
I got charged a leaving fee of ¬£125 without being warned at the time. (I tried negotiating a new contract on the phone. Wouldn't match Sky price so said I would leave Three. No warning given then of termination fees until a letter arrived weeks later. Phoned but they refused to do anything to help) Presumably they make more money from fee than keeping long term customers happy. Be very careful as they're ruthless.,0
"Happy to take your money but appalling
customer service.
I'm fairly happy with the phone and contract I bought but there have been a number of issues.
First of which is that my contract started before I even received my phone.
Second, I gave Moblie phone direct my PAC code but I waited and my number was never transferred over. After a very long wait I contacted Mobile phones direct about this and they said there was an issue, basically they blamed me for giving incorrect details. However I was able to confirm that all the details I gave were correct. I then had to restart the process of transferring my number over with my new service provider.
But worst of all is that when I have tried to complain about this I've been completely ignored. 3 times I've had the infuriating response that ""Due to technical difficulties we are unable to respond to your email"". I'm convinced that they are ignoring me and hoping I will give up.",0
"Very poor service. Internet is not working. Nobody is even trying to help. The robot is saying Your issue has been resolved. Which is simply not true.

I am trying to leave talkTalk (my contract has expired), but that seems impossible too. Nobody seems to know if I need to give them a notice or can leave straight away.
Very disappointing",0

"Now TV is awful in almost every way.

First off, it's very overpriced for what you get, and you have to spend extra to remove ads and get HD viewing.

Then, the user interface is awful. To watch something you have to find it on the website (which itself is terrible to navigate), and then it sends you to the app.

The app doesn't work on several devices / formats, apparently designed this way to convince you to buy the Now TV box. A lot of time on my laptop, the sound doesn't work, or refuses to go through bluetooth. The streaming quality is bad, the subtitles often don't work, and it goes out of sync often.

Avoid NowTV IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. This is the worst streaming experience out there.",0

I raised it with them and they just tried to wear me out rather than turn the speed up I know the line can take. They tried the usual like send us pictures of your equipment rather than just up the speed at their end. Just another bunch of dishonest crooks.

"This last two weeks i have had nothing but problems with talk talk. My wi fi keeps dropping out saying no network. I rang five different times to get it fixed but none of the technicians know what to do. When they eventually got back my wi fi everything keeps buffering. I did a speed check I was getting 26 Mbps. I am paying for 64 Mbps. Now they are sending me a booster. Why pay for 64 Mbps when I am only getting 26 Mbps. What the hell is going on with talk talk.
Here is a update.
I looked at the back of my router saw a pin hole and writing saying reboot I pushed a opened paper clip in held for 30 seconds so light goes green then took clip out left for 5 minutes until WiFi came on did a speed check now I have 50 Mbps.

Updating? You've been saying thar for years and the whole time the network has become worse!",0
I wished there could be an option to give them no start . Worst customer services. Even though my contact is completed they charged Me. I had paid for the device and they are charging me same amount . I would never recommend this co . I wished I have seen there views before buying any service from them .,0

Everytime i call the helpline, the automated system can never find my reference number and then constantly on hold for over 20 mins everytime I call until I get on with my life and hang up.

I had no service for over 1 week. I filled form over internet for refund. But nothing come back. Call customer service 10 times. Every person I spoke come with different answer . Got to no we're. Still filling very SAD. I am under contract so there charge me for leaving. It's trap.,0
"I have contacted TalkTalk live chat 3 times in the last 24 hrs to try and sort out a problem with my internet connection reliability and speed. They have kept me chatting for 4hrs in total and have not dealt with the problem. Each time I have complained I have been fobbed off with purchasing wifi extenders when the fact is everything was working well 3 days ago and now it isn't. Nothing has changed my end to create a speed problem. Extremely poor service, rude to terminate the chat without saying and this to a customer that has been with them for more than 15 years.

Dear Alina,
If 3 of your experts operatives have failed to deal with my issue, then resort to me purchasing wifi extenders which would be totally pointless. What help is your community page going to be!!!! This is just another example of fobbing the customer off instead of dealing with the issue. Something TalkTalk seams to be expert at. All I want is a phonemail off somebody who actually wants to sort the fault out. Not much to ask for a customer who has been with you for 15years.",0
"Please do not use!

Sent an iPhone 12 in perfect condition (have photos before I packaged it) no scratches or marks. Receive an email to say there are multiple heavy scratches and paintwork chips (definitely was not) and reducing offer from ¬£280 to ¬£100 as apparently the screen needs replacing.

Strange, as the photo I have of the phone doesn‚Äôt have a single scratch or mark ‚Ä¶.

Used Mazuma many times in the past without an issue, it seems to have massively gone downhill.

Response was that my phone had failed quality assurance and so would be ""1-5 working days at the latest"". Nothing arrived! Eventually after a number of emails and quality excuses I cancelled the order and was told I'd have to wait 14 working days! Finally received money back on 17th April. Emails are polite but meaningless.",0
"This is without a doubt, the worst online company with which I have dealt and I am only sorry that negative star ratings are not available. I ordered a phone on 2nd of April, but it soon became apparent they did not have such a phone to sell, so on 28th April I cancelled the order and was offered a refund. Then started a merry dance of emails back and forth during which excuses followed excuses about why the refund could not be made. Eventually, I gave up and on 23rd September applied to my credit card company for a refund under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. My appeal to them was successful and received notice of reimbursement from the bank, on 28th November.
Do not deal with this awful company.",0

One 'engineer'visited and made it so nothing could connect to the internet but the speed was faster to the hub now so that's fine.... Then an open reach engineer appointment was booked who sat in his van for half hour and then drove off, to have the nerve to say I didn't answer the door or phone when he didn't even bother trying to call or come to the house.
Tried talking with the chat team who are beyond useless and can't actually do anything, what's the point in them BT?

Now they want me to wait another 4 days for another engineer appointment!",0

Under NO Circumstances use this company.

You Pay ¬£95 to send off a broken TV - When they call you to tell you that the repair will cost more than the actual price of a new TV they then DON'T REFUND THE ¬£95.

What an absolute Scam. Terrible customer service plus pot luck whether you will actually be worse off once they look at your Tele.

Absolutely Awful",0
"I set up DD, for 5th of month they bill for 1st of month on 2 month, what use if u change bills for them to breach DD mandate? Raised 3 complaints to bout professional behaviour or Cs staff using BT messaging service, all 3 complaints closed without resolution, what use of complaining to raise standards if they ignore complaints.

Wonder how many customers they lose within 24 hours of service being connected, well they lost mines, treat customers with professional curtesy you may retain them, for ¬£20 I go from paltry 30Mbs to 312Mbs full fibre and less bad customer services.

Fao Robbie, no need to get in touch with your social media team, if bt support couldn't resolve the issue less likely the social media can do differently, but after just 1 day service, I cancelled BT, still 30 days of service avail but won't use it, I have switched to another provider",0
Utterly disgusted by the customer service team. They were very rude and threatening to terminate the call when i asked for their names. My order had been messed up and I've been trying to reach then for more than a week. Every single day on average i had to wait for 1:25hrs and i get passed around from department to department like a ball. Toady was the worst day when that lady had no idea what she was saying or doing. She had no integrity towards the company or her job. She is just a waste of time and space in the office.,0

"Just don't use talktalk. Pick any other provider. I ordered broadband with them in November. It's now December 15th and I still have no internet. The router arrived a week later than promised. They have promised 3 appointments from an engineer to get me connected. Not a single appointment was ever attended by an engineer with no prior warning. Leaving me waiting all day and having to rebook which takes a week at least for the next one.

The customer service is god awful. Noone seems to know what's going on, if an appointment has been booked, what your prior conversations have been about. They all suggest different solutions and don't follow through on any of them.
Their online chat is frustrating and irritating when you need quick answers.

Bizarrely my order was cancelled because it was to long without a solution and I was told that I couldn't have an engineer come out until my order had progressed. Creating a Kafkaesque feedback nightmare of order cancelled due to taking to long. Engineer not coming because order was cancelled. Order cancelled because engineer couldn't come to solve my issue.

I can't even tell you if the actual product is any good because I haven't ever gotten a service.

Use literally anyone",0

"I purchased a television which wasn't intended for use for a month or so after receipt, it was placed, by the driver, in a safe place where there was zero risk of damage.

Upon unpacking it was discovered that there were several gauges in the screen, which upon further inspection lined up with damage to the box it came in.

I contacted AD who claimed I should have inspected it upon receipt, which I disputed as unpacking and repacking increases the potential for damage, i said that i accepted AD wouldn't despatch a damaged item, and that in my opinion it was damaged in transit, they ultimately refused to replace the set or issue a refund.

The they gave the distinct impression they thought I had damaged it and was trying it on.

Clearly the lesson for the day is to check while the driver stands there watching.",0
"BT I‚Äôm intrigued to know how a company your size doesn‚Äôt have a complaints dept or even more concerning a complaints process. According to your staff ‚Äò ALL OF OUR ADVISORS ARE A COMPLAINTS TEAM‚Äô I imagine that‚Äôs why after speaking to 3 previous advisors of yours who have ALL INDIVIDUALLY promised me over the last 6 weeks they will refund MY MONEY to me (which you‚Äôve taken after I cancelled BT Sports back in March) they‚Äôve all investigated their own ‚Äòcomplaints‚Äô and this is why it‚Äôs still not been returned. To then be told by a 4th person today they will be closing my ‚Äòcomplaint‚Äô (because he‚Äôs a complaint handler and because he‚Äôs again supposedly refunding my money) that means I don‚Äôt have a complaint anymore.
BT; your staff DON‚ÄôT KNOW YOUR OWN COMPLAINT PROCEDURE, isn‚Äôt it a requirement of your regulator that staff should be able to at least signpost to your complaints process? Isn‚Äôt that the room 101 of customer service?
I‚Äôve told your advisor I want to make a complaint which is that I‚Äôve spoken to 3 different advisors who have not followed through with an action, although I want my money refunded the complaint is the lack of action by your staff. Your 4th advisor today does not understand this, extremely frustrating conversation with him. He even then said to me ‚Äòwhat do you want me to do then, take the money back‚Äô I‚Äôm then told when he does eventually find that you do have a complaints process that I have to put it in writing!

"Utterly lousy company to deal with. I recently tried to sell a two-year-old Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, the original quoted value of which on the Mazuma website was ¬£300. Just received an email saying that the screen is scratched and they are now trying to offer ¬£105.

The phone has been treated with care and has hardly been out of the house because of lockdown/working from home. It was in pretty much pristine condition when I posted it, well secured in a box and packaging. They also say that it has screenburn, even though I did a diagnostic test myself before it and noticed no ""ghost marks/ discolouration."" They used the screenburn excuse the last time I dealt with them, but on that occasion I accepted that there MAY have been something wrong. Now I am not so sure.

Had another look on their website and they are offering me the value of a ""faulty"" (ie, heavily, deeply scratched) product. I'd suggest it's ""good"" at worst.

I requested that they return the handset, which they did (and, to be fair, promptly) after they offered a later pitifully increased offer of ¬£160.

Upshot: took it to CEX, and was offered ¬£258, which was definitely closer to the mark.

I recommend that if you have something to sell/recycle, go somewhere else. Save yourself the bother. I'd put more trust in a pawn shop, or somewhere really downmarket, like Cash Converters, before attempting to trade with Mazuma again.

I can only assume that they are profiteering from the current cost of living crisis and offering potential returning customers a pittance because they think they are desperate for cash.",0

I did a big order online. I received the confirmation with estimated delivery dates & times. Unfortunately there were 6 different deliveries & delivery companies I had to deal with. None of the deliveries came when it was said. Half of the items were delayed and no communication given. Currys also gave an insufficient address for delivery of one of the items for the 3rd party. Every time I called to ask for an update the customer service was uninterested and unhelpful. Next time I will spend my money elsewhere,0

"My online order was fine until the point where I had to actually engage directly with CPW staff.

I foolishly ordered the phone for a Click and Collect on Manchester Market Street during the Xmas period, so no doubt I was dealing with Xmas temps, but they weren't nearly the worst part of my experience. Initially I waited three days for a notification of my Click and Collect delivery to store (supposed to be next day delivery) but only when I used the webchat service (which was fine) was I told that my phone was awaiting collection. I wonder how long it would have been if I hadn't followed up?

I took my lunch break out to pick up the phone on store which took over 45 minutes. I used to work for o2 and a Click and Collect order was just a scan on the till and done. Don't know why your process is so laborious?

Following this I tried to recycle my old phone only to be told a week later that my perfectly functional good condition phone was ""non working"" and I was offered a frankly insulting ¬£25 instead of the ¬£115 I was expecting for my S8. I have photos of my phone date stamped and geotagged in full working order (the CPW trade box is even in the background of the picture!) and am now waiting for CPW to confirm that they will be sending my phone back as I have rejected their ""offer"". If there is any damage to my phone, they can rest assured that I will be seeking compensation for wasted time as well as the full recycle value as promised.

I have now been told to reset to factory settings in case there is a software problem. Before I do this, I have to store all of the data before wiping the phone. If that doesn't work, I then have to find an old phone to use whilst the phone is sent away for ""repair"". In a straight forward case of the phone being faulty, with video evidence, surely a new replacement should be provided? Also, will I get compensation for the time spent trying to find a solution and all of the broken phone conversations due to the phone fading in and out?",0
"I have been a BT customer for over 30yrs, but was really upset when my bill increased to over ¬£80 without any discussion. We then decided to move to Sky, who offered a similar service. Sky cancelled everything and I received emails from BT to confirm that I was moving. I subsequently cancelled the direct debit. I then received an email from BT to say that as I had cancelled my direct debit they would still be billing me. I phoned to talk to them, giving the reference on the email. They claim to know nothing about me leaving, until I confirmed the dates on the texts and emails I have received. I have now been hanging on the phone for over half an hour whilst a lady called Evelyn looked at the problem.I have now been transferred to Jenna, but am still on hold whilst they organise the paperwork to check what I am talking about. They sent me the email with a reference and still are not able to talk to me about the issue. I have now been on the phone for over 50 minutes and am still on hold for Jenna. She has explained the issue, but it has still been very poor customer service. I have now been promised a phone call to confirm the outcome as I objected to being on hold for almost an hour.",0
"I am a finance director for a medium to large size business and recently lost/had stolen my laptop so I logged onto one of our two online accounts and started to choose a high quality replacement. The first few I wanted none were available for delivery but could be collected in store but only from stores 100 miles away. Frustrating. Eventually after 20 minutes I settled on one. I added MS Office, a bag, mouse and keyboard and went to checkout with a basket value of around ¬£3,750. This is where the fun started. I checked delivery details but the screen when it came to card payment would not progress to allow me to populate the card details it just got into a loop and went back to order and then delivery details. Even when I changed the delivery method to collection it just wasn‚Äôt having it. I then remembered about two years ago the same problem. I called someone to my office from IT and he was none the wiser. I swore due to the frustration and told him to go down to the Aintree Store at 17:30 and purchase it via our business account but to pay it off as I was considering closing the account due to this experience which to be frank is comical and must be costing you dearly.",0
"If I didn‚Äôt have an 18 month contract I wouldn‚Äôt pay for this and use my unlimited phone internet instead.

Get charged a late fee for missing a payment, which is quite high I do believe if it wasn‚Äôt affordable then adding an extra cost will not make it easier to pay. Once having paid the bill, the internet is not turned back on and was informed it would take 2 days to turn back on. Although I had called a few days prior and was passed through 5 people and then finally told there was technical issues and they‚Äôd call back. None of them knew what was going on, and no one called back. Honestly the worst customer service I have experienced and I do wonder where they find their staff and if they actually train them at all. Not rude just lazy.",0
"1 star is much more than I would like to say NOW TV is worth!!!!
I signed up for the free trial but it wasn't for me and cancelled before the trial ended, I received a cancellation email and thought that was it, then a couple of months later I noticed Now TV on my bank statements and they had taken 4 payments from me and had not cancelled my service as said, I contacted them but they keep saying they can't find my account so can't refund me, I sent proof of cancellation plus bank records and my username and password to show the service is still active but they refuse to acknowledge i have an account, this pathetic excuse for a company needs CLOSING DOWN!!!!!!",0
"I have placed an order with just now, which never came and I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs my fault. I have responded to the driver immediately via text and called 2x (no pick up) with in seconds of receipt with no reply.

I have gone downstairs to find the driver and also used your chat, which could not be bothered to look into this matter properly and just closed them without any outcome.

I asked for refund for this and their reply is, we attempted delivery. This is no way treat customers like this! Quite shocking!",0
Stay away from Virgin Media. Broadband goes down regularly (at least every month) for days at a time. Just this week I'm going on Day 5 of not having any internet services and their estimated fix date is Dec 28th which would make it 2 FULL weeks without any internet. As someone who works from home this is unacceptable. They say they compensate you for every day without internet service which is a complete lie. I have never seen a dime in compensation and when you file a complaint you get a generic response refusing to give the compensation that you are entitled to. Wish I hadn't signed the contract. It's probably worth spending the ¬£275 in cancellation fees just to get out of it and get a more reliable internet provider. HORRIBLE COMPANY!,0
"On speaking with DPD today it appears that my parcel that I paid ¬£5.95 for two day delivery on is not arriving for Christmas. I ordered on Sunday and you were advising Tuesday as the deadline for 2 day delivery. This is very misleading. DPD have advised that anything received on Monday had missed the deadline but I have had no notification from HMV.
I would like my delivery charge refunded and I will not use HMV again. I now have a very disappointed daughter.",0

"Absolutely awful company, tried to cancel my subscription out of contract and was told I‚Äôd still have to pay, the guy on the phone told me I wouldn‚Äôt need to pay if my line got taken over but my line got taken over on 14/11/2022 and they have since took ¬£93 out of my account for absolutely nothing! Customer service is shocking the line kept cutting out, 10 times they said they would ‚Äòinvestigate‚Äô and be 2 minutes and the line cut out! and I had to call back, was told they would call me back if the line cut out again but nothing. Money grabbers! Took out my car insurance money and can‚Äôt talk to anyone get it back absolutely shocking.

Edit- I clearly just want my money back, ¬£93 for absolutely nothing is an absolute joke",0
"Marks Electrical is a company to avoid like the plague, as I should have done.

I purchased a Hoover tumble dryer in November with an extended warranty and I also paid for the adjustment of the feet to the floor.

This didn‚Äôt need to be done as it was level when they put it on the floor.

The tumble dryer had a door which was flimsy and shabbily made.

I then sent an email to Marks asking for a refund of the ¬£25 paid for the levelling that didn‚Äôt happen and to ask for their comment about the door.

As I didn‚Äôt get a reply to that email, I sent another and I didn‚Äôt get a reply to that either.

I searched for Mr Mark Smithson‚Äôs email address on CEOemail dot com and noted that he had asked for it to be withdrawn. I have never seen this before - I wonder why!

With no hope of success, I sent a further email, I did finally get a reply of sorts:

""Thank you for contacting Mark's Electrical today!
For any order support, you must enter your relevant information, on our Help and advice page""

After sending two emails without a reply, then getting a third like the above, I understand now what they meant by:

""Customers first, second and third Get this right and it powers everything else!!""

What a joke, but not funny - pathetic!",0
"The bed I bought was of a very low quality
Assembled the bed correctly and looked good at the beginning

During that same night, two of the central legs collapsed and subsequently a couple of slates broke too.

Ordered my food at 17:41 and I am still waiting at 19:26. Called them and got told the same thing that the app said.

Absolutely abysmal customer service when things go wrong. My ex-wife bought me a Nokia 1 Plus last May and it failed to charge up just before Christmas. The staff in the shop refused to change it or have it repaired as my wife was the purchaser and I cannot contact her as I don't know where she lives now. I also wanted to change from ID (another Carphone Warehouse company) to EE and again the staff in the Penzance store were extremely unhelpful and couldn't give a damn. I got in touch with Nokia who sent me a prepaid label to return it free of charge for repairs and had to buy a secondhand phone elsewhere as a stop-gap. AVOID CARPHONE WAREHOUSE AT ALL COST AS THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T CARE IF ANY FAULTS ARISE.,0
"I placed an order on the 9th December that never arrived and have been fobbed off for the past two weeks. Despite me complaining when the order was already one hour outside of the delivery window. On the app, it says if your order is 60 mins late you can cancel, I have the screenshot of this promise, after I placed my order‚Ä¶ But they refused and asked me to wait 3 hours, then I‚Äôd receive a refund. But then they only repeated the same jargon to me, without an explanation as to why they wouldn‚Äôt refund me. Deliveroo is facilitating fraud and claiming plausible deniability. They continue to promote restaurants that do not deliver and they don‚Äôt even warn you that there could be a potential problem. Calling customer service is another excruciating experience. The team is based in South East Asia and are as sweet as can be, but many of them don‚Äôt know or understand consumer laws in the UK, so they give very questionable advice. I‚Äôve reported this to my payment provider, I‚Äôm raising a case against Deliveroo with trading standards and I will report them to BBC watchdog. Unbelievably terrible customer service (or lack there of).",0

Placed an order for iphone XS on 22nd May at 2am and even though 13 days have passed there were not any signs of any delivery and when I repeatedly contacted them for the cancellation and refund of the money they just started to make excuses and using delaying tactics for the refund. I have been told it would take 14 working days for the refund which I am completely unable to understand why it is supposed to take 14 working days to refund money against a product which was never delivered. Please avoid this seller if you can as it seems like they don't have products in stock they just wait for forever to source products and then try to deliver if they can.,0

What a bunch of lying clowns this organisation is. Team Know How theres a misrepresentation in itself!

Contacted the store where purchased to be advised that TeamKnowHow had booked an appointment to attend my address 09.09 re replacing the plug. After speaking to an agent on chat was advised that this repair would be conducted 02.09.
Engineer called 02.09 to advise me that he and his counterpart did not have the correct equipment to change the plug but would re-schedule the appointment for 05.09 for a specialist team to attend and change it.
Guess what didn't turn up and when called to enquire what was happening the wife was greeted by a rude, surly and abrupt so and so called Abbey whom basically called us liars.

"I‚Äôve been with Vodafone for a number of years now and god knows why because it‚Äôs just been disappointment from start to finish. Slow speeds, terrible customer service, never following through on promises and I couldn‚Äôt even count the hours wasted on the phone to them that I will never get back just for the same problems to occur and for them to give you the same solution that doesn‚Äôt work. Without a doubt Vodafone is probably the absolute worst company I have ever dealt with. I don‚Äôt mean the worst broadband company, I mean the worst company ever! Your discounts aren‚Äôt going to work now (the only reason I have stayed this long in the first place). Avoid this company if you actually want broadband that works.",0
"I will say this. They have the absolute worst customer service ever!! Absolutely avoid these scumbags that are running behind the phone. They don't care, they don't know what they are doing and they WILL mess around with you. For the sake of your sanity go with a different company.

I'm having issues with my sim disconnecting and for some reason, the system switched my sim to pay as you go, when i have a pay monthly contract with a phone! I'm a taxi driver who earns as a sole trader and have to keep a business running where customers need to be in touch, and my phone suddenly disconnects, unable to call or receive calls.

I call Vodafone who tell me someone switched it to pay as you go, when no intervention was done to switch it to pay as you go. They tell me its going to be switched back to my pay monthly contract within 24 hours. Now, this is a Friday for a taxi driver, and I lose customers as a result, sacrificing my business.

Next day, Saturday, I call them again, which is a series of 2 calls that went on for 3 hours!! They wasted my time. They keep telling me sorry, thinking words will fix the situation, and I told 2 agents to keep a note to compensate for my work. These agents said they made a note, but guess what, none of them made a note, which shows they were lying. These workers don't have a clue what they are doing and lie. They told me the sim is cancelled and I thought I'll use another company for a sim and that's it, my contract is cancelled 5 months into a 24 months contract. That's what they told me!

I then try webchat to get a PAC code, and they have the audacity to tell me the fee is ¬£846.10, when the worker on the phone said its cancelled? Why are your workers saying whatever they want when it's a complete lie.

One of the workers was called Menna (Friday 6th August). Kumar was one I wasted 2 hours of my time with! Another one was Sobhan Shaikh. I've told them to bring the manager, but they say there isn't one?? What??? It's been pretty much 24 hours with no sign that my network is back. Your foreign call centres fail to do anything.


I ask for a PAC code and it suddenly fixes itself, as if they decided to rush it up. I thought okay, that's it. I insisted on them to compensate for my earnings for a Friday, which would be several hundred pounds, and 2 of the workers told me that they would make a note - which was to compensate ¬£30 per hour that I couldn't work due to not being able to recieve calls from customers. They had the audacity to tell me they will only compensate ¬£40 at the end with the last agent, even though the previous workers told me the ¬£30/hr request would be noted. Absolutely disgusting liars that don't listen.

Now it's a Saturday night, the phone disconnects again, with the sim card unable to give or recieve calls. They told me the issue was over earlier on today, but it's come back.

I'm now completely stuck over the busy weekend without a working phone, and the customer service don't care, refusing to let me leave their absolutely shocking network that disconnects by having the audacity to insist on a cancellation fee when they are putting me through all of this. They are the reason I am several hundred pounds down on my business through ZERO fault of my own. Absolutely disgusting.

I will consider raising this up to small claims court since they are providing me with a service that clearly doesn't work, and even though they told me that it won't happen again, it just did! They aren't compensating me for their issues, and the workers there just say whatever the hell they want without knowing what they are on about. Many times in the call they kept getting confused, verification checks weren't adequate and they looked at the wrong number at first, further showing these workers I dealt with have no clue what they are doing.

I will never go with Vodafone again, and will take my wife and son's vodafone contracts out. They are absolutely shocking with customer service when you have a problem and will not do anything to help you!! You lot owe me for the several hundred pounds that you've cost my business for not being able to use the phone over the weekend, yet you have the audacity to think ¬£40 is enough.

You need to put me in touch with a manager Vodafone! Your 3 employees failed to solve a problem which you are behind and is of no fault of my own, and has cost my business several hundreds, as well as customers that i've built up a reputation with over years. It is very clear I need a manager since I keep going in circles with your employees who don't know what they are on about or doing.

These scumbags have the audacity to say that you have to stay with their terrible network for 24 months even after all the hassle they put me through, and with a sim card that does not work.

Do not go with vodafone, and for the sake of your sanity, go with a different company. You'll do yourself a big favour.",0

"I have been waiting for a refund of ¬£799 for the last 5 weeks. I placed an online order with Car Phone Warehouse for the delivery of a phone. I received confirmation of my order and my specificied delivery date. The next day I received an email stating that the phone could not be delivered on my specified date and that it was going to be delivered 2 days later! This was very inconvenient so I cancelled the order and had to purchase a mobile from my local store. When I called I was initially told by customer service that the money would be credited within 3-5 working days to my debit card. The money did not arrive! I then received an email to say it could take up to 14 days. When the money didnt appear I rang customer service and was then told I was being sent a cheque and it should arrive within 28 days!!! It's outrageous, I was never consulted that this was going to happen! Surely this is breaking consumer law? Guess what, the cheque did not arrive and I have had to relentlessy chase again and have rang and emailed a dozen times wasting precious time and money.

I was told that the banking team will look into it but that it takes 3-5 working days. Today, when I rang I was utterly astounded when I was told that they were going to issue me with another cheque, which could take up to another 28 days?? Where is the logic? On every single occasion I have made it categorically clear that they reimburse my debit card. I complained and requested that the banking team be emailed immediately to cancel this cheque and reimburse my debit card. The person I spoke to was very reluctant to do so. So what guarantee do I have that it will actually happen?

I've requested twice for a callback by a manager, and surprise surprise they have not even had the decency to do so!! Why can't I ever speak to a manager? Every time I'm told they are busy, at lunch, in a meeting etc.

Why am I having to do all the chasing up? No-one seems to use any intitiative to try and help resolve the issue. Why is that? I have been bleating about this same topic since I cancelled my order on the 29th June. The staff I speak to appear to have an insincere attitude and a patter of rehearsed apologies, but no-one is actually helping me to get my money back. This is the most appalling customer service I have ever experienced!!

It is the summer holidays and I would like to spend this money with my family. I need someone at CPW to resolve this as a matter of urgency as I do not understand why I am being financially inconvenienced by your company's incompetent and outdated systems and communication.

"This is a follow-up review to previous ones I've written on here re TT's service in the past few months. A few weeks ago, on a Monday, my (basic service) internet with TT died, for no apparent reason. In the a.m. it'd worked fine, in the p.m. when I logged on the router light was red, not blue as it should be, & the internet had gone. Subsequently I had no internet for 3 WEEKS. This caused MASSIVE problems & inconvenience & this is the ONLY service I have with TT - just basic internet. From day 1 of this fiasco I called TT several times, being passed from 1 dept to another, increasingly frustratingly & without success, and that continued to the end of the week when, finally, 1 of their team (who actually was more helpful & caring than many of the others I'd had to speak to) in the IT department did some tests at his end but was unable to identify what the issue was, only that my internet was running below speed (it was still totally gone at that point so it was actually running at ZERO speed!) so he arranged an appointment for an engineer to come out for the following Friday - a full 12 days from the onset of the loss of my internet, but that was the earliest appointment he could get for me, even after talking with a colleague to get that one instead of an even later one he had first told me the engineer could come out on, So, yet another week (week 2) had passed with no internet. Then, even more unbelievably, on the Friday of the engineer appointment I got a phone call from the engineer not long before he was due (he sounded not very nice on the phone, which didn't bode well!) saying he was on his way and would be here soon. When he turned up he called again, saying he couldn't park outside as there was no parking (on the street), so I went outside and he was still in his van, leaning out of the window to (quite aggressively) communicate with me, instead of having even an ounce of decency to get out to come up to me to talk in a civilized manner. This was right outside the house (where I rent a flat) and other cars were parked in the dead end street there but there was a space for his van right there! He yapped on, nastily and virtually glaring at me, that it was a parking zone for residents only, that he would need a ticket thingy from the Council to be able to park there, blah, blah, blah. I told him I was a non-driver and didn't know that, and also that when I signed up with Talk Talk only a few months previously the person that came to install it had had no issue with parking outside. The engineer refused to park and basically just bug***ed off, leaving me totally high & dry and, still, without internet. I was shocked and flabbergasted at his obnoxious, appalling, totally unprofessional & unhelpful behaviour. To me it seemed as if he was already in a foul mood by the time he was on his way to my address but there was no excuse for treating anyone else badly because of it. The man was totally obnoxious and not fit to deal with any customers, let alone go into their homes. With his foul attitude I wouldn't have wanted him in my home anyway, he was that nasty.

So, I immediately got on the phone to TT (for the umpteenth time since my internet had vanished) to complain about their vile engineer's horrendous attitude, his lame excuse for not doing the work he was supposed to do, and about him having just driven off, leaving me high and dry and still without internet. I made it very clear to them that he COULD have parked outside on the street but had insisted that he wouldn't, so I would not be paying their fee (if they then had the nerve to try to charge me) for a cancelled engineer visit as it was not me who cancelled the visit but their obnoxious engineer who had refused to park to come in & do the work he was supposed to do. I said that the man had been an absolute disgrace and that he was not fit to be around customers. The person I spoke with on the phone was extremely apologetic, and actually quite nice, and took all the details of the complaint down. She then arranged for another engineer to come out a few days later, which was the earliest date available, which was another whole week later. However, when that engineer came he was VERY nice, professional and helpful - i.e. everything the 1st engineer had not been. He came to my door and said that initially he'd be checking the box outside, just down the road, to see if there was an issue there, and that if there wasn't then he'd need to come in to check the internet connections in my flat, etc. He came back a few minutes later to tell me that there WAS an issue with the set-up in the box so he'd escalate the matter with TT & that a BT engineer would need to come to do the repair within 72 hours. 2 days later the BT guy came & sorted everything out within the hour. FINALLY, internet restored!

My TT experience so far has been AWFUL, aside from the nice 2nd engineer & some CS staff . I can't recommend!!",0

"I called and explained my situation that I was out of work they gave me 2 months to pay a bill that was high due to internet coverage in another country to which I could not afford. I called every month and explained that I couldn‚Äôt pay it. It‚Äôs now at ¬£320. Which understandably I have now been cut off but what is NOT acceptable is the fact I have been called 18 times in the past 2 days in fact sorry not ‚Äúcalled‚Äù more harassed into paying. In this current climate with fuel, electricity and rent etc going up you‚Äôd think the big companies would be a little more understanding of peoples situations since not everyone gets to drive a Ferrari or own and afford a mansion but unfortunately the way of the world these days when big tries to become bigger by trying to belittle small. I could stand next to a 5G tower and my phone wouldn‚Äôt load a video, shocking service, shocking customer service and another worry to add on top of everything else that‚Äôs went wrong in my life so far this year so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Three unless I hated that person.",0
"Absolute shambles trying to get a new fibre line installed with BT. I booked my installation weeks in advance to coincide with the end of my existing provider. I followed the pre-installation checklists they sent to the letter. My engineer arrives an hour early for the Friday afternoon slot -- brilliant, I think -- and then the problems begin. Apparently as I own a leasehold first-floor flat he needs some permission from his manager to drill a hole or something. I leave him to it -- he says he's calling his manager. Then that his manager is calling their manager. Then he says that he's waiting for his manager to get back to him, he'll pop off to do another nearby job and return after that. He'll call me when he's on his way round in case I need to take the dog out. Then, nothing. I wait in all afternoon, then I try calling his mobile several times between 5 and 6pm -- no answer. At this point I'm both furious and in despair as my current connection gets cut off at midnight, and I have an online work conference to attend all weekend and am due to be working from home (online) as of Monday. I called BT customer service and they said they can't do anything until after 6pm. I called after 6pm and after going through security got cut off. No-one called me back. I called again and waited on hold for ages but had to leave for a prior appointment before I could get through.
On Saturday morning, I called customer service again, to be told that I could rebook for two weeks' time. I said that wasn't a viable option for me -- I cannot be without internet for two weeks as that means I cannot work. Apparently there's nothing they can do, despite, I understand, Openreach being a subsidiary of BT and my having been stood up by the engineer. It turns out they needed 'permission' from the ground floor flat, and as the occupants happened to not be in when the engineer knocked on their door at midday on Friday, that was that. I should talk to them to get permission. I explained I'd already done that earlier in the week -- the engineer had never asked me about this nor communicated any of this to me. I asked to speak to the person's manager in a futile attempt to get internet installed without having to wait two weeks. Manager not in until Tuesday -- they will call me then. Ridiculous. I left it that I was cancelling my order.
Since then, I've had once missed call from a London number on Tuesday (customer services manager?), and have received a confirmation of my new installation date in two weeks' time along with a permission form from Openreach that I'd have to print out and get the GFF to sign. I don't have a printer, and I'd cancelled my order.
In order to be able to do my job, I reactivated my previous provider's line and am now tied into an 18-month contract with them.",0
"I was offered a contract with Sky but Talk Talk offered a deal that was a slightly lower price so I went with them. I wish I had gone with Sky.
It is impossible to contact anyone at Talk Talk to talk to if you have a problem, 'managers' have promised to return my call, but have not done so. Email compalints are ignored and go unanswered.
If you require any form of customer service, avoid this company at all costs.
Contact Sky, their deals are financially as good and the service could not be worse.
You have been warned.
Reply to the Talk Talk response. 28 September 2022.
Why can't I contact you by phone? It was my understanding that Talk Talk are, amongst other things, a phone company. Surely you should be promoting the use of the telephone.
I was told by one of your employees to write an email, which I did, only to be told by another employee that Talk Talk do not reply to email complaints - despite me being given a complaint reference number from Talk Talk?
I was advised to write a letter of complaint to Talk Talk, which I have done and this is in the post.
I find this rarher odd. Talk Talk are a company who deals with communications and it appears that the best means of communication, to Talk Talk, is via a written letter posted to their Salford offices.
I have drafted the letter with a quill as this should suit a company who appears to be shunning all modern methods of communication.",0

SHOCKING EXPERIENCE for a first time customer!!! I preordered the iPhone 14 Pro Max 128GB in space black. Two areas on the web page both confirming if I ordered now delivery would be on the 16th of September. The night before I‚Äôm informed that in fact I won‚Äôt be getting it until the 30th of September. I spoke to customer services who firstly denied any mention that delivery was meant for the 16th and told me that there‚Äôs a chance I could be waiting past their next delivery date of the 30th. Shocking and unprofessional. No choice to wait and see what happens as it‚Äôs impossible to get hold of the phone from any other retailer. Such a shame as I heard amazing things about mobile phones direct. I would very much appreciate an update on my order.,0

"This is an update of my previous Argos review following a fault developing with a recently acquired HP laptop. I took some encouragement from the fact that they responded, but it was only for show. Having supplied them with all the order details that they requested, they simply reiterated their policy that I had to go directly to HP as I've had the laptop for more than 30 days. In short, up to 30 days, maybe they look after you, after 30 days, they simply refer you to the manufacturer. I will not be purchasing any goods from Argos as a result, and will probably bin off Sainsbury's as well. If one of their brands thinks that it's acceptable to do nothing when you've spent ¬£650 on a faulty laptop, what reason would I have to think any other group companies care? Simple lesson, go to John Lewis, and don't spend money anywhere where you get no support if something goes wrong.",0

"First and foremost, I am not a Vodafone customer.

Someone used my identity to take out a couple of contracts with Vodafone.
Despite me raising this directly with them, they still felt it was appropriate to chase me for debt (which I specifically asked them not to do and they agreed).
This has led to a negative impact on my credit rating. I had a letter from the fraud team to confirm that they have identified it (correctly) as fraud and the contracts have been cancelled and I wouldn't need to worry anymore about it.

I called to complain about the impact on my credit rating and the customer services representative I spoke to was awful. Initially they tried to transfer me to the fraud team when I described the issue with the debt collection, but the fraud team wouldn't take the call.
Due to the manner in which the person spoke to me and their outright refusal to help, I asked to speak with someone else. They then lied to me, telling me that their system does not allow them to transfer calls (despite already trying to put me through to the fraud team).

I then raised a complaint through resolver, which Vodafone immediately undermined by setting up something on their own complaints system and tried pushing me towards. They have this far refused to respond to anything on resolver.
The person that has been responding to me has failed to understand that my complaint is mainly about the failure of the non-fraud departments I've spoken to and they are refusing to comment on it saying that I need to contact the fraud team.

This company is a joke and they deserve the overall 1.3 star rating.",0

"I have used FFX many times in the past and always found them to be pretty good. However my last few attempts have all ended with the same dire results despite numerous assurances from them.

Trying to order a tool bag and taking advantage of their next day service....seems pretty straight forward and is advertised all over their site, Ordered and looked forward to receiving the next day. Unfortunately no sign the next day so a quick call to be told they had shipped it late and would be here until the following week which was no good. I asked if they could re divert but was told 'no', so asked them to cancel the order, stop delivery and to refund my card as I will just reorder and choose next day again. No refund until they receive the bag back (not sure just how long this will take but fortunately have used my credit card for protection) so a second purchase yesterday followed by a phone call to a lovely lady at FFX who promised me that she had spoken with the dispatch team and given me a free upgrade to pre 12 this morning. I had a message yesterday afternoon to say DPD had collected so all was looking good until this morning. However I had no text from DPD so went onto the FFX chat and spoke with Chris who apologised and told me it was down for Monday delivery (not sure who the lovely lady spoke to arranging Saturday Pre 12 or if that really happened). Again they couldn't re divert the bag but could cancel delivery and refund me once they received it back. Chris also offered me 5% so I could get online today and then make a third order (this will be my third payment of nearly ¬£170 they have) so I can get the bag tomorrow (Sunday). I accepted, ended the chat and then went to order.....only to find they no longer have it in stock.

I get that things can go wrong occasionally in any business but twice in a subsequent days and after a phone call of assurance is pretty poor service. In a day where I am trying to not just use Amazon for everything, I have had to go to Amazon once again this morning and am now having delivered tomorrow through them (supplied by AC One). If FFX cannot reliably give a service, stop offering it and certainly stop your assurances when someone calls to confirm it.",0

"Based on the horrific experience ive had over the past 4 weeks waiting for my Samsung A-42 to return from your repair shop. I spoke to 7-10 of your staff members and i have had nothing but lies and false promises which includes, my device had been fixed after 1 week in repairs and has been delivered back to carphone warehouse on Western Road in Brighton. I then went to the shop to collect it and was told that the repair had been done but it had not been sent back for some odd reason. Three days later i return to the store and was advised that my device had been delivered to my home address by DPD, but no one was there to receive it and that i would need to contact DPD to have it redelivered.
1. At no time during the conversation i had with the Manager Gavin from your Western Road Store the day before did we ever discussed the option for my device to be deliverd to my home address.which never happened because my partner and i was home all day and when i contact DPD, they confirmed that there had been no attempt to deliver a parcel to my address and that neither my name or address could be found in there database.
I then went back to your customer services and was told that the phone had been delivered to another address by mistake and that it was on route back to their warehouse and they would then send the device back to the brighton store where i would collect it. Well it hss been over 4 weeks and i stiill havent received my device as i have now been told that the device had gone missing and that they are going to replace it.
So to improve my experience.
1. A call back with an update would be a good start.
2. Compensation or a reduction to my bill as i have not been able to use my phone for over a month.
3.A replacement handset three weeks ago would have been putting the customer first and resloved the issue there and then",0

Last Monday, was promised on the phone that a replacement voucher for my laptop that they couldn‚Äôt fix would be with me in 72 hours. I phoned 72 hours later. Was told on the phone it would be with me at the end of the day.

It was not.

I went to my local branch to complain. The manager told me that the phone operators should not have told me three days. He told me it would likely be with me at the weekend. It is now Wednesday. That was a lie.

I told my clients I would be able to complete work for them last Thursday.

I have spoken to various operators and had various direct message conversations on Twitter. I am being fed the same rubbish.

I have paid good money to this firm, and in return they have cost me hundreds of pounds and damaged my working relationships.

I hope that their complaints resolution is sufficient enough to retain my custom, which is hanging by a thread. I am appalled that I and others would be treated in this way.",0
"Have been with now tv broadband for a year now and usually happens that the Internet speed slows down or we don't have Internet connection at all.
Now it's dying and called the customer service, they're working on it but it could take days to sort it out and we don't get any compensation for that. We have important assignments and work what we need wifi for but cannot do anything.
Definitely will change from Now Tv.",0

"Good afternoon Beth,

Your response sums up the poor service that virgin gives.

Do you not think I have tried all these mediums?! Maybe one day you and your team at virgin should have to endure the issues we all have with your AI and the support team on the end of the phones.

This response is very poor and yet again wastes everyone‚Äôs time.

"I decided to join BT from Sky I'm 2021 during a house move. At the time BT had quite a big media campaign regarding their services and in addition thier collaboration with EE - Unfortunately I was fooled by the media and have been let down at every opportunity..

VOL053-8578750671497 has been my complaint, running since March due to the lack of service. I moved house again and organised for my BT to follow me into the new property. It started okay, the BT engineer came, plugged a few things in, the blue light turned on and he left, but it all went down from there.

My Internet soon cut out with speeds so low not even one device could work. My situation, my partner and I work from home regularly and we have 2 children.... as a result we are significantly reliant on our Internet provider with devices such as laptops for work, television, children's devices and a baby monitor - non of which now work.... still to this day.

The initial complaint was made in March, firstly it was a my fault within the property, then I was told it was an exchange fault, then a star connect fault in the property and now a network fault... all of which have not been resolved or updated - I have been promised call backs, which I haven't received and no-one can give me straight answers or even just fix the problem.

I am now left with having to pay for mobile data to run work laptops, television, devices and my baby monitor, all at additional costs without any assistance from BT.

The customer service has been equally as bad, I've been passed from department to department, one call lasted over an hour, and three times I was handed to a department which wasn't even relevant to the fault!

It's been a woefully terrible expirence and I really would warn anyone having a look at BT to stay clear, go to another provider because the service, speeds, tech and customer service have been a disgrace and I'm really sad to say this is a British company.",0
"NowTV and their customer service is a disgrace. My account has not been working since they made a mistake with my payment. After multiple ( daily for weeks) emails back and forth they decided it was my box and sent a stick to replace it. The stick is the same. Can not connect to my account. Customer service are robotic and only answer one question per email. They just keep telling me to restart it. Unable to actually talk to any one. Impacting my mental health in a negative way and yet they still do not respond to me telling them I am a vulnerable customer. Disgusting, do not buy unless you want to pay for something you do not get.",0

"Worst Customer Service. Easy sing in contract. But Your life will be hell to end up the contract.

"I have been a Vodafone customer for over 20 years and I was always impressed with their customer service. However there has been a significant decline in that area. I tried to get an upgrade and was instead given a second contract. The process I had to go through to resolve this was farcical. First of all it took ages to talk to anyone. Then I was made to jump through hoops to fix something that wasn't my fault. The people I spoke to were never based in the UK and I found them rude and unhelpful. Vodafone are not cheap when compared with other providers and with this level of service I do not wish to remain with them. Reading the other reviews, I can see that I am not alone. What a shame for a company that used to be so good.",0

"I moved house 5 months ago and I tried to use the 3 shop in Maidenhead, but they refused to do a change of address and told me to do it online or call 3.

So I tried online and it was absolutely impossible (I didn't have the password), so called 3 and explained the situation but they wouldn't change the address, as I was unable to obtain numbers over the phone (I'm nearly 80) whilst I was using the mobile to call, but did give them every detail about the move! PS I have changed my address with over 200 hundred other companies with zero problems and no hassle. I spent over an hour trying to do the change with 3 but despite all the information provided they refused. Until I was put through to a special group in Scotland where is was sorted out quickly with no problems.

I wont talk about the time that 3 deleted all my contacts and pictures doing a mobile upgrade!

Don't use 3!",0
Pretty rubbish - not worked for 2 days - we thought we would never come back but they had a good offer - Unfortunately the last 2 days we cannot even access the movies that they are offering - I would also say the movies are not refreshed very often - so if you watch a lot of movies you will very quickly run out of the ones you would like to watch.,0
"I have an ongoing complaint and will probablly end up in court.

Was misadvised on several counts by Team Knowhow delivery team who lied saying a fridge freezer wouldn't fit into my property and that I had to re-order a really small one unless I was willing to knock the wall down. I made a dificult decision to take the wall down and replace it once the appliance had been delivered based on the advice given by Team Knowhow.

I was advised they had cancelled my order and to re-order the fridge freezer again, which had at that point increased in price by ¬£100.

On the day of delivery of the new fridge I was advised I never needed to remove the wall as the fridge was always big enough to fit as they could remove the doors (something that should have been offered on day 1).

So to top off the needless destruction of property based on lies told by lazy delivery drivers... I then find out that the first order had not been cancelled and that I was due to be the proud owner of 2 ""oversized"" fridge freezers.

I've since had a refund for the extra fridge and the ¬£100 difference, however significanly affected my finances for a week whilst I waited for this.

The saga continues when I try to contact teamknow how on the phone to make a claim for the wall (which the second delivery crew recommended I did). I then get told that they outsource all their deliveries to franchised delivery crews and that my claim should be with them despire me making the purchase and paying currys for delivery. I then received a call of the delivery partner where the guy on the phone basically argued the case with me and argued that they didn't tell me to knock the wall down so wasn't their problem. My complaint is not with knocking a wall down. My complaint is knocking a wall down needlessly because a delivery crew lied about the size of something just because they weren't comfortable pulling their finger out and taking the doors off.

After 2 weeks of aggressive emails to head office i've finally had a response from the devliery partner to advise that Team Knowhow are taking over this as an investigation. But if I'm honest I don't have high hopes and I can see this going to a small claims court.

Naturally I'm outraged by the whole situation, what should have been a pleasent, seamless delivery experience has turned into a nightmare, I'm now out of pocket to my landlord for the wall, and I would rather walk over hot coals than deal with Currys PC World again.


EDIT: So a little update to my situation, Currys have denied any liability for the whole situation, taking a your word vs ours stance. However they failed to realise my home CCTV captured the conversation with Audio, I'll be presenting this evidence in court and putting DSG Retail in their place.",0

"Job of a service! Got my broadband installed on 12/01 and after the installation I was told someone else would need to come out in a months time to complete some repairs on outside wiring and construction. ONE MONTH!
So basically my initial installation date was half a job, a half hearted service. As the installer left he told me that till the second installation date I will be facing intermittent internet issues but what he didn‚Äôt tell me was the internet will be non existent and when it does work I‚Äôm limited only in the living room where the router is!!
Have spoken to the shocking customer service reps who are all clueless at what they are doing and one person will tell you one thing and another ten people will tell you a 100 different things! Also i was told i would receive a virgin hub 5 but have received a hub 3. Now when i chased that up i got told they were all out of stock on hub 5s?!?!? Why did you not inform me????? So i rang the sales team acting like a new customer and asked if they have any hub 5s in stock and guess what? I got told they have them in stock!!! The call was recorded by myself as well as another call to the rep that told me they dont have any in stock!!!

Going back to the second installation. I was given three different dates for it to happen. First got told 02/02 then 14/01 and now 09/02!!!

"This arm of Currys has to be the biggest joke of a company I have ever dealt with, beyond useless staff, impossible to find anyone to provide a straight answer, systems that don't work, and promises that never materialize.

To provide a bit of context here is my story.

On the 11/05/21 I discovered an issue with a Tv I purchased from Currys 4 months prior.

I called Team Knowhow for assistance and navigated the poor automated phone system. Having got through to a member of staff I explained the problem, the steps I had taken to resolve it and it was agreed the Tv would need collecting to assess and repair if possible. I was then asked for my receipt number, unable to find it I was advised I would have to be transferred to customer support for a copy.

So speaking with customer support I explained I needed a copy of my receipt number, after a bit of messing around one was sent to me via email and back to Team Knowhow I was transferred. I then had to go through the process again of explaining my problem and providing my recently obtained receipt number.. At this point the gentleman on the phone tells me that it isn't a valid number, I explained I had just been sent it by his colleague and it has all the relevant details.. Un interested he just told me I'd need to get another number.. Ok what other number am I going to get???? And if I get another number and that doesn't work then what I asked?!... I advised it's not my problem that their internal systems don't speak to each other and advised he should speak with his colleague to try and resolve the issue.. at which point I was interrupted and he just transferred me back to customer support..

So I now have the joy of explaining the whole issue once again, thankfully I got the only genuinely decent member of staff that works for this sham of a company, he could see that a receipt was generated, verified it was correct then went off to speak to Team Knowhow to ensure they where entering things correctly, it transpired they weren't and the number I was given was in fact correct. So he explained he would have to transfer me back to them in order to arrange the support collection.

I explained the issue, gave the receipt number and collection was arranged the following day between 07:00am and 11:00am. Phew....

So the day of the collection arrived, having taken a few hours off work I waited patiently... 11:00am came and went with no sign of collection despite receiving a confirmation text.

Calling team knowhow I managed to speak to an advisor who advised the collection had been cancelled because they didn't have any boxes for the Tv.. Very annoyed I asked why I wasn't contacted and made aware of this, no answer was given.

I then asked when the iTv was going to be collected to which I was advised possibly Saturday but they couldn't verify anything as the internal systems were undergoing an upgrade.

Annoyed I asked to speak to a manager to try and get things moving a bit quicker.. the girl on the end of the phone advised she couldn't do that because she was working from home but would transfer me to Customer service... So this is where the real fun begins..

Transferred to customer services, explain my issue and get told this isn't for them and needs to be Team Knowhow support, transferred to them, explain the problem again to a guy who couldn't care less, he fobs me off saying he needs to transfer me to another department and transfers me to ""washing machines""... Speak with the guy in washing machines and we both have a laugh about the fact his colleagues are useless, if I'd have bought a washing machine I reckon he'd have sorted it for me. Sadly he has to transfer me back to customer services, this time I stand my ground and advise I'm not getting transferred again and want an answer then when my tv is getting collected.

Reluctantly the guy on the end of the line takes the complaint and advised that a manger would be in contact in 48hrs as per policy., and while on the line advises that the collection has been booked in for Friday the 14th.

Sooooo Friday comes around firstly 48hrs passes and shock, no call from a manager... Secondly no text message to advise the tv is to be collected and again no surprise no one turns up!

Calling Team Knowhow once again I was advised the collection is now down for Saturday, due to not being in Saturday I asked them to cancel it and re arrange for the following week, which the chap on the phone did...

Saturday morning I get a call on my mobile while I'm at work... It was the collection outside my house asking me to come to the door... Seriously when they're meant to turn up they don't and when you don't want them there they are...

This company is an absolute joke, the worst customer experience I have ever had and will be avoiding Currys from now on.",0
"They gave me 5 leads for free.

4/5 said they already had a developer / designer, the fifth never responded.

If someone half fills out the form, they still count the person as a lead.

The ‚Äúget hired guarantee‚Äù is false advertising. They do NOT guarantee you get hired. They give you a few more bad leads ONCE.

So if you call/email the 10 $500 leads, they all say they don‚Äôt need you, and then the next 10 say the same thing, you‚Äôre out 500 and the company blames you.",0
"I have ordered 4 appliances including fitting. All arrived different days with team know how advising me incorrectly on every occasion what was coming.
I have also bought a 3 grand tv from currys previously in which I could not get to accept a hard drive (that came with the tv) all they done was read out the instruction manual to me, as if I didnt try this before waiting 40 minutes for one of their incompetent staff to answer the phone. Got to say worst customer service from any company, however only use them as the price is usually the cheapest and I can see the product before purchase. But to charge people for their services is a complete waste of money.",0
"This guys are very similar to those who sells you stolen phones on the street take your money and next minute they have nothing to do with it.

So definitely avoid this guys;
1 if you end up in the same scenario as me next day of buying the phone so no helps you can get which means through your iPhone in the bin.
2 surely no customer care at all",0
"A very annoying company
I signed for a special offer of 3 month for a ¬£1 per month
I have absolutely no recollection of also having signing up for a boost at ¬£5 a month till I saw it having been taken from my credit card.. Till then I had no idea what a boost even was. When I tried to get it cancelled and refunded it was like trying to get blood out of a stone. With much persistance I got my refund
I continued with my discounted subscription
I saw 3 films that Interested me after which all I could find were old films I'd already seen long ago.
I was since shocked to find that I have to watch 5 adverts ahead of each film. What's worse is if you don't like a film and try watching something else you have to watch another 5 ads each time
Something one doesn't ecpect from a Paid subscription channel.
Needless to say I will cancel before the next pay date comes around and never use NOW TV again",0

Avoid Currys online. I echo other customers who have bought online at Currys and had awful experiences when items are not delivered or are faulty. Phone calls get through to a call handling service in Africa who are not able or empowered to answer or deal with your enquiries. They keep saying they are waiting for a back office response which never comes. Promised emails never arrive. Their delivery company Dpd are frankly dishonest most of the time. It would appear Currys want to wear the customers down till they give up wanting their money back. Always buy in store,0

"I have been lured with one of their offes for broadband and I cancelled my current contract which was about to end. An email of confirmation of my purchase was sent out and they have also give me the opportunity to book the inginer on what date they've had available. In the confirmation it said that my devices will be sent out 3-4 days before the installation date. When the installation date came closer and the devices weren't delivered I tracked the delivery just to find out that they cancelled it. My partner tried to call them but he was left hanging for more than an hour and a day after they told him that they cannot check the account because they have meintenance issues but we should not worry because if we got the purchase proof. When the installation day came and nobody showed up I rang them just to find out that they cancelled my order but they didn't told me so... I even booked that day off so I can stay with the engineer.

"Avoid the staff named Munir Mamo in Kingston Upon Thames 3 store please, otherwise you will have a lot of troubles from the phone, the contract and unexpected bills. I went to this store a month ago for a phone upgrade, this staff spent more than 3 hours to do this service. I thought he was a new staff and sat there patiently to allow him complete this simple service with plenty of time, I could not remember the exact time I went into the store but I remember I have not had my lunch yet, I left the store after 5 o'clock without a receipt. On my way home, I still received his phone call to asked quite a few questions. A few days later, I could not use my phone for any thing, I called 3 to find out the problem, the staff found I have used all my mobile data of 1GB , which I requested unlimited data when I upgrade the phone. Munir Mamo confirmed that I was paying for an unlimited mobile data when he do the service. Yesterday, I received total amount of ¬£141.28 for three business accounts which I never requested nor used, and this amount of money already left my bank account. How surprised service! If you want enjoying the network and new phone, please avoid this store and this staff!

"Sent my LG 65‚Äù OLED tv away for a screen burn repair. The tv was in immaculate condition and looked like new. Upon its return I noticed straight away that the tv had been damaged, dented and bent near the top edge of the screen. So I refused the tv and asked for it to be sent back. To my amazement I then witnessed the delivery driver take the tv back in no box or protective packaging, bang the tv on the metal edged stairs leaving my apartment block, drop it on it‚Äôs edge onto the back of the delivery vans tail lift, use the tv as leverage to lift himself up into the tail lift, lean on the tv as he lifted the back door, drop the tv into a box with next to zero packaging, slam the tv up and down till it sat in the box properly and then finally kick the box into place on the van. I have taken photos and my cctv caught everything that happened. The tv cost the best part of ¬£3000 and after witnessing how it was handled I demanded a replacement tv. The manager I spoke to at know how just told me the tv would be repaired and sent back again.

"The WORST company ever! I do not recommend.

I made an order on the 13th February, on the 24th February i asked why is the order taking so long to be shipped. I was then ignored by a customer service officer, i responded to the email and asked again and received a one line email on the 25th February and it said 'This is due to delays within quality control'. I was offered no apologies, no solution and no timeframe.

I then had to request a timeframe and was told they will aim to ship it out the next week.I had received no update after this, so i had contacted them again on the 9th March and rightfully requested contact from the manager.The request to speak to the manager was ignored and i was told that it will shipped out the next week.This was the second time they told me that my phone will be shipped out the next week. On the 10th March, i requested to speak to the manager again and was ignored again. On the 10th March i was sent an email stating refund takes 14 days and cannot reinstate an order once cancelled, on the 11th March i responded a requested an immediate refund.Instead of cancelling my order,i was ignored and i received a duplicate email on 12th March.

I emailed them on 12th March and told them that i want them to refund me and i want to receive notification of my refund as proof.On the 13th March, i again requested for my refund to be processed and for me to be notified once its done, i also requested an email address for head office as i wished to make a formal complaint but i received no response and i was ignored.On the 17th March, i chased them up stating that i am waiting for confirmation that my refund was sent and i'm still waiting for head office's email address.

The customer advisor responded to me and stated that the finance department stated that i will recieve my refund on or before the 8th April however she ignored my request for the email.I requested the email on more than 3 occasions and have not received it.I also have not received my refund so i will have to chase them up AGAIN!

Honestly, save yourselves the hassle and DO NOT use this company, they're lazy and provide poor customer service.I'm still considering whether i will be taking legal action.

They have NO CONCERN for customer care and instead of reaching out to me, they got my review because I mentioned the staff names which is against trust pilot guidelines.",0

"First the ‚Äòknow how team‚Äô came to collect my tv as it isn‚Äôt working when they came to collect it, the man was unprepared had no tools and I had to lend him mine, after this he still couldn‚Äôt get the tv off the wall after unplugging and and not being able to plug it back in, he then assured me that he would rebook for the following day and send someone with the right equipment. The next day nothing happened so I waited till the day after, I had to call Currys myself and rebook (they had no idea the man didn‚Äôt collect the tv) so he clearly didn‚Äôt tell anyone about my situation, once I finally rebooked the Currys employee on the phone said they would come the next day, I had a phone call the next day (4 hours before the time window opened) I reminded them the time and let them know they‚Äôre 4 hours early, their reply was ‚Äúits corona virus we come when we want‚Äù
After this I just said ‚Äúfine come when you can‚Äù
They didn‚Äôt even turn up, I called Currys hours after the phone call let them know the situation, to which they were extremely unhelpful, after being on the phone for 40 minutes being transferred here, there and everywhere, I was hung up on, so I called back immediately, that is when I just gave up and rebooked the whole appointment again as I still need my tv repaired.

"On 26th Nov 2019 bought online a 43 inch TV plus a wooden stand also included payment for installation of both TV and Stand plus removal of old TV.Recieved message saying TV would be delivered and in stalled 3rd Dec.Items were delivered but team informed me that another team would do installation.
Later that day contacted cust serv who apologised and rebooked app for 10th dec.Team arrived and informed me that they were scheduled only to install TV ,but assured me that they rebooked me for frid 13th when a specialist team would do installation of all items .
Frid 13th another team arrived insisted that job had not been booked right and they had insufficient time to do job .They apologised and once again I was assured they had rebooked another app for 31st dec but may be sooner if any cancellations.
Contacted cust serv was assured that had app booked for frid 20th.Lo and behold frid came and went contacted cust serv who informed van had broken down but an app had been made for Sunday 22nd and I would be contacted that morning.
On Sunday morning contacted cust serv to ask if there was any idea when team would arrive was informed 3.05 till 7.05 .At 5.40 contacted cust serv again explained situation and again was assured that I was last booking on the list and they would be there by 6.30 .
Needless to say they did not .
I don't know what annoys me the most , what appears to be being mislead , lied to then given continual assurance that things were being actioned .
Meanwhile I am sitting in my lounge with 2 large unopened boxes waiting for installation.
Would I recommend this company definitely not.",0
"Totally agree with reviews. We were persuaded to change from EE broadband to BT. Told save ¬£10 per month. Same service data etc. Had 2 exit penalty letters from EE. First for over ¬£200 thought this was sorted only to have money taken from account. Now find new router not as good as EE. BT want extra ¬£16 per month for ‚Äòdiscs‚Äô to improve signal. As now can‚Äôt use WiFi in garden. What a joke ! Don‚Äôt change from EE

Had response from BT to send message via Twitter. Did. Just got generic response saying book an engineer and a website explaining how to solve problems yourself. The problem is the BT router is inferior to the old EE unless sign up for their discs(?). Typical bad customer service from BT.

I have continued to correspond with BT concerning this issue but besides offering to try and get me a deal on their discs I have had no joy. So as I said at the beginning don‚Äôt change.",0
"Well what can I say.
4th review and I will keep putting reviews on until you contact me.

Service advisor lied to me by telling me that she would stop the 22% price rise Virgin media will be charging us from April.

How do I know she lied. I simply called them again to confirm what I was told was true. And I was told it wasn't true as she didn't have the authority to stop the increase in payment.

I asked for you to listen to the call and you're reply is not all Calls are recorded. And you also stated you have no access to my account. So why are you answering the reviews. Is it a hobby you have. It can't be a job, why would virgin media pay someone to reply to reviews who cannot help the complainers. Why indeed.

So either contact me or I'll keep putting reviews on. Iv probably got a good 20 years left in me, and I'll use them all enjoying my new hobby writing reviews about your neglect and dishonesty. It's up to you......
Toodle pip for now.",0
"Interesting that Virgin Media replied to my first review. Quicker to get a response here than from customer services. The response stated ""we're(Virgin media) not immune from inflation and we are seeing rising costs across the business"".

Nobody is immune from inflation but the enforced price rises, above inflation, will affect customers adversely.

To recap VM are implementing price rises of retail price index(R.P.I.) + 5.9% every year. The R.P.I. is NOT considered an official inflation rate by the Government. They use Consumer price index(C.P.I.). BT, EE and most other companies use the CPI as a basis. CPI is currently 10.5%, whilst RPI is 13.4%

Both measures attempt to measure the effect of prices on a typical household and do NOT reflect the effect of inflation on VM's costs.

On top of the inflated inflation rate VM are adding 3.9% and will be doing this EVERY year.

If VM choose to reply to this review then please justify:
1. Why use RPI
2. Why increase this by 3.9%
3. Why insist on this every year.

Anyone negotiating a new contract or becoming a new contract should also insist on responses to the 3 questions",0

And then on the 10th of March they emailed me saying that my phone hasn‚Äôt even been dispatched yet. They also said that I could cancel my order and get a full refund. So that is what I did. I cancelled my refund (on the 11th of March) and to this day I still haven‚Äôt received the refund. They kept delaying the refund. I told them I will report them if I don‚Äôt get my refund and they assured me that I will get my refund on or before the 1st of May.

"Absolutely woeful

Went into the store to purchase a mobile phone. Stood around for 15-20 minutes before a member of staff even saw to us, due to them having a lack of staff. He comes over, offers us a little advice and then goes off whilst we deliberate.

We make our decision a few minutes later and then have to stand around for 15-20 minutes to speak to a member of staff. Plenty of staff around, however they were Curry‚Äôs staff who aren‚Äôt qualified to deal with mobile phones.

Eventually someone sees to us. The phone we selected is priced at ¬£649, a saving of ¬£200. When the chap serving us runs this through the till, the ¬£200 saving is not being applied. He advised he is not authorised to offer the reduction and his manager who would normally do this is off. He puts a message in what I believe is a group chat of managers, however no one is able to help. So the store is being ran without a manager to assist.

We say we aren‚Äôt happy, so they bring someone over who is apparently a manager from the Curry‚Äôs section (although his name badge doesn‚Äôt state this). He was pretty abrupt and rude, and advised he does not have the access to offer the discount. I say that I would like to raise a complaint. He says I am able to do this online. I ask for a phone number and he literally could not find the number when he went online. Another member of staff had to show him the number was on a leaflet.

Safe to say I will not be buying a phone off those again",0
"I've just spent well over half an hour trying to make a payment via the automated system, without success despite three attempts.
In early August a meter reading was submitted by the tenant of the property we own as the tenants were leaving the property on that particular date. I submitted a further reading meter reading on 2nd September, having been advised to submit readings at the beginning of each month whilst the property remained empty. I was further advised that Shell would send me a total bill when the property was re-occupied. At that time, the customer service was fine.
A very different story today however, as on 23 September I received a small bill dated 8 September stating payment was expected by the 26 September. Having tried but failed to make a payment via the automated system, I spoke to THREE shell customer services staff who all told me they can't access the automated system. The third member of staff confirmed there was a fault on the automated system, but why aren't customers being informed of this from the start? All three offered to transfer me to someone who might be able to help! I was left waiting and listening to endless music but no-one answered the phone. The service today was a total shambles and I've been unable to either submit a reading OR pay the bill. I would never choose Shell as an energy supplier but because our tenants were transferred to Shell when their chosen supplier could not continue. As a result, I am stuck with Shell until new tenants move in, when I will be advising them to change the energy supplier ASAP.",0
"I traded in my LG G6 in January. The process is that they send a prepaid envelope for you, so I followed instructions and also wrote my account number on the outside.

"I have completed another review about HMV, updated it once but it won't let me further update it.
So here goes an update to my other review about my dissapointing experience with HMV online.
Previously...ordered an item online and was informed it would be delivered to store within two to five working days. Two weeks later - no where to be seen. Sent an enquiry, had a reply and now they can state they are dealing with my issue on my review.
However...the item was late, I went to the store and saw the item for sale on the shelf on the 26th November 2022. I asked while there if my order had arrived even though I had no email or text. The helpful staff looked then said no it was not there.
The reply I received from HMV said that the item was ready to be picked up from the 17th November. And that they were sorry I had not received my notification to collect.
(I bought the last one on the shelf today, if I had waited I would not have had what I wanted)
Okay, not impossible but also not my fault.
The reply also said that I would get my requested refund...after the item is received back at their warehouse!
-So not only did I not receive what I had paid for.
-Not only did I receive a, ""it was there all along"", explanation.
-But now I have to wait for the imaginary item to be sent back to their warehouse before I can receive a refund for no service at all.

Online shopping is a great experience, especially if you just don't have time to literally go to the shops. Browsing for something can show you what many stores are offering and for what price. In less time than it takes to visit one shop. But always-buyer beware.
But having not followed my own rule No1, 'read the reviews first'. I was thrown into the same pit of dissapointment as so many others.
And those of us who do read them know where the oh so detailed and praising reveiws come from. So you read good and bad and draw your own conclusion.
Because of this experience I have spoken to other people who have had more similar adventures to mine than haven't. And they seem to be fairly consistant.
But making me wait for my money until they verify their own mistake is a little too far, hence my unsavoury review.
A little piece of information for you...the company that operate the delivery to store is apparrently a separate company to HMV. Please correct me if I'm wrong HMV.",0

"My recent experience with VM customer services reflects a dreadfull un co-ordinated team and system. The service portrays an inexperienced and poorly trained team‚Ä¶so why do I give this review?

My first call was more than 30 minutes with an outcome of new V Box tone despatched for self installation..
More than week later I called to confirm despatch..the advisor stated no record of agreement to send new box
So another 30 minutes with outcome no new box but stated anengineer visit was required
Engineer came and within 2 minutes installed new box and confirmed only resolution to problem is new box.
On next bill charged ¬£25 for call out..annoyed and contacted CS to get charge reversed as not my decision to send engineer..on phone for 20 plus minutes and advisor confirmed should not be charged and new bill issued same day.
Three days later no new invoice on my account..
Further phone call to ensure credit raised and no money taken by direct debit on next collection date. CS advisor assured me the credit was raised and would not be taken‚Ä¶

Today after taking time off from work to stay in no one showed up and I had to ring, spend half an hour on the telephone to find out that they were too busy to visit us and hear silly excuses.

"Used them from many years and each time I called into the store was getting more and more suspicious of their service. Personal touch gone and more interested in making a deal that actually sorting out your query. And now their online service is even shabbier. Order a phone, all went through ok only to receive not a new phone but a reconditioned one. The box had been opened and was damaged, the phone was originally for the EU market and had had several alterations done to it so that it was usable for the UK. After many email chats, I have returned the phone and asked them to cancel the contract. I know they have received the return as I sent it special delivery (tracker system). Although I try to resolve the issue, it would seem I am being ghosted. I was promised that I would receive my postage back as well for returning the item - this has also been forgotten. I will never use them again. Go elsewhere.",0
"I used my ¬£12 Tesco loyalty vouchers to credit my Now TV account at 3x face value ie ¬£36 as per Tesco partner promotion. The money arrived in my Now TV account but the web link to allocate this to a particular package was broken. The online help chat line was useless. I have had to cancel my existing 'entertainment' package and have to wait until this times out to try again to renew the package using the ¬£36 credit. Not sure if this will work... Time will tell.
The most frustrating thing in trying to sort this out is the lack of a telephone helpline.

"Would get zero stars if possible. Company is an absolute joke and customer service is non existent. On the 1/12/21 I received a empty box instead of the laptop I paid alot of money for. I rang straight away to report it and requested someone phone me. I was told someone would phone me straight away but they never did. I rang again the next day went though it all again and was told the same again. So it's now Friday no reply at all so I rang agian and finally got what I thought was help. My item had not been logged in the system so two days after reporting it I got a lost in transit number and was told it would be dealt with in 3-5 working days. After this time frame expired I phoned back and was told 14 days, then I asked to be transferred to a manager or team leader who then said 17 days. I waited for this time to expire and had to phone again to chase up a Denial of receipt form that was meant to of been sent weeks ago. I then spoke to what I was told was another manager who told me that all that was needed to complete my investigation was the DOR form then I would get a refund or replacement. Another week on no acknowledgement of any kind and I'm having to chase up callbacks that are not being returned. I've requested multiple callbacks and some have meant to of been priority and not received one. Your customer service is an absolute joke. I will also be contacting the managing directors Mark Jones and John Akbar.

"Needed broadband installed in a 2nd property. Broadband hub did not arrive as said, so engineer couldnt install when the line was installed. BT sent a 2nd hub. Didnt turn up, chased, one was finally delivered next day after my call to chase where the hub was (packaging clearly stated only sent the day before‚Ä¶.). Drove 180 miles to property to install, no broadband cable/filter was supplied in box and there was no indication anywhere that it was needed. It wasn‚Äôt in the hub box and the engineer who fitted the line did not leave one or mention it. Given 15 quid compensation to go and buy my own... BT was aware this was a 2nd property 180 miles from my home and i have a day job so not easy to sort. Cost me time and money. Now don‚Äôt have the opportunity to set broadband up for another couple of weeks. Been a car crash from start to finish. BT are not professional, the only sense I got was from telephone support, the online chat feature through the BT app isnt fit for purpose.

Luckily i took screen shots of the chat so i could record promises to sort (theres no way to keep a record of those interactions otherwise). Come on BT, do better.",0

"On a business trip to London, I downloaded the Deliveroo app excited to try a new food delivery service. I ordered from the only restaurant available, Papillon Grill. I was starving and couldn‚Äôt wait, so I sat in the hotel lobby anxiously waiting for the food. However, after about two hours, it said it was delivered but was not. I was furious and tried to contact someone. The Deliveroo app said this restaurant handles their own deliveries so contact them with any delivery issues. I called the restaurant repeatedly but no one answered. The only other option in the app under ‚ÄúReport an issue -> Order not delivered‚Äù was live chat. I tried that over and over but no one replied. I gave up and ordered something through UberEats, which worked perfectly. I ended up reading many other reviews online saying the exact same thing had happened to other people using Deliveroo to order from this restaurant. The next day I wrote to the Deliveroo customer service email and explained what happened, assuming they‚Äôd make it right. After several days they said they were investigating. Finally they followed up to let me know the restaurant said it was delivered so they would not refund the order. They essentially blamed me for ordering on THEIR app from this particular restaurant which handles its own delivery - saying I was ‚Äúwarned.‚Äù The only ‚Äúwarning‚Äù was live tracking wouldn‚Äôt be available - NOT that they would let this ‚Äúrestaurant‚Äù/clearly frauds business scam me. I told them this was not right as their app is clearly letting people continue to get ripped off by this place. They sent the same nonsense reply saying I‚Äôd have to contact the restaurant (even though I had already told them I had tried and that was entirely futile). I went to the Deliveroo Instagram to see if others had experienced this, and was actually quite horrified to see just how frequently people have problems with Deliveroo saying an order was delivered when it actually was not. Clearly this is a much, much bigger problem than I realized. Deliveroo cannot be trusted.",0

"Update: Having left the following review, as you can see, studio responded (I suppose it looks good) However, it just took me back to before. I messaged and mentioned this review.

Therefore, unfortunately, I‚Äôm going to have to pay ¬£45 owed on my account for trainers which I returned but I will then close my studio account and no longer shop with them. I would advise others not to shop with them also because if you need to return an item/s you may not get a refund, even though you no longer have the item/s. It‚Äôs not worth it. Shop elsewhere!

I have shopped with Ace (studio) for many years and have had no problems with items I‚Äôve purchased until now. Unfortunately, they use EVRI as their courier.
I paid EVRI to return an item to studio on the 8th of November. Studio are saying they have not received the item and so therefore, I‚Äôve lost ¬£45 for the item. Plus, ¬£3.49 paid to EVRI.
I have emailed studio a number of times and asked them to chase EVRI.
They replied at first and asked for more details which I gave them and then just sent a routine reply each time.
My request for them to chase EVRI has been ignored.
I have spent a lot of money with studio but if I cannot be refunded for any returns, then I shall close my account and shop elsewhere in future.

"READ THE REVIEWS!- wish I had read reviews!

Date comes and goes, no refund, more emails, rest assured your refund will be in bank within further 5 days. Still not refunded on 5th day, that's when every email you send they no longer respond. From 5th March to 22nd April, no refund and now ignoring all emails. This whole situation made worse that my child had saved up and had asked me to order it. Will NEVER do this again and Quick Fix mobile having now read your reviews I recognise your pattern through all the other contributors who have had same happen to them. After a number of promises to refund, I was of the opinion I would have to take to small claims court, I contacted my bank, who started to look at the transaction, dont know if this was of any significance but 2 days later, the full amount from Quick Fix mobiles was credited to my account, with no correspondence from them. So if like me you are still waiting for their refund try contacting your bank - this may be a coincidence but thankfully I went to another company ran by one of the phone networks that you get sim cards for, it was recommended because of their tariffs, I read their reviews. Within 24 hours a fabulous refurbished phone arrived and have had no problems with it. If you do trade with Quick fix be warned as a lot of the reviews I have seen were having same problems as me, to be fair this happened through lockdown so they may have been having some financial or supply issues, but that is as fair as I will be.",0

"I handed my phone in for repair on 6th November.
The handset was sent off for repair.
On 10th November, I had a text to say my phone was repaired, and it will take around 48hrs for it to be delivered to the store.
I received no contact from CPW to say it had arrived.
I had to contact the repair team on 14th November to chase up, they told me it was in store, and had been repaired.
I went in to collect phone on 17th November, to be told that the phone could not be repaired, as it was not authorized by the manufacturer. How could CPW mess this up so bad.
Why was I not told this when the phone was handed in for repair? Are your staff not trained on these scenarios/instructions?
Now I have been told that I must contact the manufacturer myself, to get this resolved.
Why should the customer have to do this? I purchased the phone from CPW, so you should take responsibility for the repair from start to end.
All you have done is just passed the responsibility on to the customer, which I find appalling.
Because of your Now I am having to waste a lot of effort contacting the manufacturer, when I have had no direct contact with them to date.
Why would I ever want to purchase any device from CPW again, in the future?
There was no option to even replace the handset, to say I‚Äôm very disappointed in your customer service is an understatement. I will be posting n your social network platform to ensure customer ask you about warranty upfront, as you don‚Äôt inform them when you should do.",0

I've been conned out of literally hundreds of pounds due to miselling of a mobile phone by Carphone Warehouse two years ago. The salesman was very pushy and tried to make out he had my best interests at heart when he very clearly didn't. Not long after having had the phone it was faulty.

"Been a bt customer since January 2014. My house is within 500 feet of the Fibre cabinet so my download speed was consistently 79mb out of a possible 80mb at that time. Each subsequent year my download speeds get slower. Last year it was 63mb, right now its 53-55mb. So somebody is slowing it down or 'capping' the speed.

Received a brand new router. A bt engineer visited last tuesday and showed me on his device that my connection was slower than the line is capable of i.e 80mb. The device was showing a fixed speed of 53.1mb. Then on Thursday last week 2 days later an open reach engineer visited, he confirmed the same findings and checked all my connections, wires, router and then went outside checking the wires from the house and finally the cabinet in the street. No errors were found and my line is stable with no errors. After rebooting, waiting for 24 hours etc, the bt speed test showed again my download speed was 53-55mb.

Another bt engineer is visiting this thursday to find the 'fault'. Why? The facts are there. My download speed is slower than possible. bt only guarantees a minimum speed of 48mb even though I'm 500 feet away from the cabinet. I would expect 65mb should be a minimum speed. There is little or no interference on my line. If the street cabinet is full then add another one. Yet the price goes up each year.

Both bt and openreach refuse to accept that either of them have lowered my download speed down even though its a fact. Dreadful customer service after 8 years as a customer and reluctance to take any form of responsibility.",0
"Absolutely shocking service from BT Business, placed a order for BT ICloud on 10th June, needed to have a new broadband line installed to allow for the existing line to switch to digital.

I am counting down to the end of my contract and I will NEVER purchase from there again.

They didn‚Äôt turn up the day of connection and I kept getting emails saying we will contact you in 3 days, this was every day. I‚Äôve cancelled as they are unable to tell me when I‚Äôll get connected and are now charging me for a broken contract in the previous house which they broke to set me up as a new customer. I was categorically told I didn‚Äôt need to pay as I was in the cooling off period as said new customer not mentioning the old contract high THEY couldn‚Äôt transfer across. I‚Äôve had a dreadful 9 years with BT and this is the final straw. Please do not ever go with them. They are to big and extremely unreliable every single time.",0

"I have been trying to cancel my account since 12 October, and it is now 22 November and my account is still active.

To type out the entire ordeal would result in a novel. In short, I have spoken to dozens of agents on the phone, on live chat, on SMS, sent emails, spent countless hours, multiple days, and a large amount of phone credit, simply trying to close my account. Every time without a single exception, I was transferred to the wrong team, given the wrong number, disconnected, or lied to. Out of literally dozens of TalkTalk agents, every single one of them did something completely wrong, unhelpful, or genuinely absurd.

I was forced to cancel my direct debit and this is now a legal matter. I was told the TalkTalk legal team would contact me by 13 November. Have not heard from them, and I know it‚Äôs because the TalkTalk employee I spoke to was unable to arrange it correctly.

Being unable and/or unwilling to close an account and to continue to demand payment is fraud. I now have to contact third party help and legal advice to protect myself against TalkTalk taking action against me, and I am compiling all the correspondence I‚Äôve had with them as evidence.

This has affected my life and my wellbeing and caused me great distress. I have never had such an ordeal with any company, it does not seem real.

Do anything you must to avoid using TalkTalk.

EDIT: Tried one last time today (6 Dec). Outlined I had an excess of evidence of breach of contract and that it's not in TalkTalk company's interest to take legal action against me. Agent Dan told me I was being put through to complaints, as he couldn't transfer me to the legal team himself. He promised me I would get through to them if I stayed on the line. I've been on hold waiting for that answer for 3 hours and 40 minutes and it's now 8pm which is when the website says the phones close. Now I stop attempting to communicate with TalkTalk and fully pursue the legal route. The stress from this is making me ill and this will be settled as a civil suit.

Do not do this to yourself.",0
Sent the wrong item‚Ä¶ not just a little wrong but a lot wrong. Took it back to a store to get a refund to be told that it probably won‚Äôt be refunded and has to go through a warranty check etc and it probably will fail which means I won‚Äôt get my money back ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,0
"This is a worse internet service provider I have ever had in my life. It is worse than the old dial up. Furthermore, if you want to contact their technical team, you end up by hanging up without talking to someone and their custom service telephone contact is hidden.

"Me and my partner moved into our new property in November and my partner requested a transfer of broadband. A subcontractor that is responsible for the installation of the fiber line came out to our house and assessed the work needing done and said work needed done on our neighbours property. I then asked them to come out a few days later to get permission from our neighbour. They did not return. After that we contacted virgin to then be told that we needed our neighbour to contact them to agree to works. After our neighbour went through the hassle of agreeing to works we were then told that an engineer would be out to set up our WiFi but the external works still hadn't been completed. We had then contacted the subcontractor directly with no response. After speaking to multiple agents and repeatedly asking when the external works would be done there response was ""you'll just need to wait and see if it's done"". As of now we are only 3 days from the date the engineer is meant to be at our property to Finally get a text saying ""the external work will be completed on the 27th of January"" that is nearly 7 weeks waiting for works to be completed that we were told would have been completed already. As for the agents they weren't disrespectful but they had no idea of what we were asking of them. It seemed that they weren't trained to well and were fast tracked to being on the phones to the public. And finally their WhatsApp chat is a shockingly slow and tedious ordeal due to waiting between 30 to 60 minutes for a reply until you mention that you're wanting to cancel the work and the contract then suddenly they're replying instantly as if their lives were on the line. For the past three months it has been nothing but false promises and poor service. This is the first time I've dealt with virgin and it'll certainly be the last.",0

Lo and behold had exactly the same experience. This time I was a little more savvy. I asked for photographic evidence of the markings/scratches on my iPhone. What happened next would be laughable if it was not serious. They sent me photos of an iPhone with lots of bad marks on the bottom, and substantial scratches on the rear of it - clearly not my iPhone as my photos of my iPhone confirmed. Miraculously they then said they had ""reviewed"" the matter and would offer me the original price! Another company in this market seemingly operating highly dubious practices or with shambolic processes that result in ownership of devices sent to them being muddled up. My advice - always take photos of your device before sending to these sorts of buyers and if they then claim non existent markings etc, provide them with photo evidence and threaten legal action if necessary.",0

I have rung customer services 3 times, all to no avail. No one is able to tell us what the problem is or when it will be fixed. BT has no concept of what a supplier/customer relationship should be. If a supplier cannot supply the service they have agreed to supply they should be informing the customer of what the problem is and what they are doing to resolve the problem and giving a realistic timescale for the resolution of the problem.
BT is a communications company that cannot or will not communicate effectively.

Update as of 7th December - awaiting refund
Email finally received from QMF on 11th November, acknowledging order cancellation and stating that a refund will be procesesed within 14 working days (ie the 3rd December). It is now the 7th December. I have had no response from QMF.

Update as of 10th Nov - Still no response after 22 days

5 emails sent asking for status of order - no response to any.
Email sent on 10th November asking for refund - no response as yet.

"I got a call for an upgrade on Wednesday and changed my address, as I had moved. On Friday, I ordered a new phone and confirmed my details with the updated address (which was already in their system and went through). Next day delivery was confirmed with a one hour window.

When the phone didn't arrive in the one hour window, I checked my email where the address for delivery was listed as an old address. I called and was told that my order had been signed for by me at that address, which I obviously did not do, as I don't live in the same city anymore. They contacted DPD to collect the package and said it would be with me on Tuesday at the earliest, as they would need to collect the phone from the address in another city before bringing it to me.

When I asked what would happen if the package had been opened (as it had been signed for by someone who was not me), they did not have an answer. I am also now paying for a more expensive contract to go with the phone I have not received due to their error. After ending the call, I then received the details via email that the phone needed to be collected, though I don't see how this is useful to me, as I am not the courier company and am not the relevant party to collect the misdelivered package.

The woman I spoke with on the phone was not particularly understanding, and didn't seem to comprehend how this was a huge inconvenience on my part. In my view, a new phone should have immediately been sent to the correct address and they could chase up any returns of the phone delivered incorrectly without having me affected. Very disappointed in the service.

I called back as I was not happy with the current resolution. I explained that I shouldn't be waiting for a handset that was misdelivered, but they said they need to try and collect it before they send any other handsets out, so I am still waiting until Tuesday. They have offered ¬£50 via cheque (because we live in the 21st century and that makes sense). Before I ended the call, I asked them to tell me the address on file and she read out of the old address that I had changed three times. I asked her if we could change it, as that was incorrect and had been changed on many occasions (as was the purpose of my call), and she said I would need to go into a Carphone Warehouse store and do it there with two forms of ID. This had never been mentioned before in the past three phone calls I have had with Carphone Warehouse, when I had changed my address each time. Shocking service.

UPDATE: I went in to Carphone Warehouse on 23-2-2020 and the staff were very confused as to why I was told I needed 2 forms of ID and to change the address in person. They quite happily updated my details, confirming my current address which is now correct in the system. On 24-2-2020, I hadn't received any confirmation from Carphone Warehouse; I called Customer Service and was told that they spoke with DPD, who said there was nothing to collect from the address where the handset had been delivered, and assured me that a new handset would be sent out to me for Tuesday. On 25-2-2020, I spoke with Customer Service who said that the delivery was being sent out and the address was confirmed to be in Leicester (where I have never lived or visited); I was put on hold and the call was cut off. I rang back and was told that there was no record of any deliveries whatsoever and that DPD are now doing an investigation into a signature dispute, and that I would need to wait between 3-5 working days. On 27-2-2020, I was told that we were still waiting on the DPD investigation. On 28-2-2020, I was told that the DPD investigation was complete and DPD said everything was fine because they did deliver the handset to the address instructed. I was unstructed by Carphone Warehouse to make a police report against DPD, but I declined, as it was Carphone Warehouse at fault. I am now waiting 3-5 working days for Carphone Warehouse to find call recordings of my case.",0

"Today I went into the Colwick Argos in Sainsburys. I wanted to return some items I had ordered online and I had collected the previous day.

Some of the items were underwear purchased for my wife, which were unsuitable and still in sealed packaging. The female Customer Advisor said they do not accept underwear returns despite having returned underwear before with no issues. Therefore, I asked to speak to the manager Dan. He reiterated what the Customer Advisor had said, that underwear was not returnable as he couldn‚Äôt verify whether they had been worn. I then responded by saying they were only collected the previous day and were still in sealed packaging. He continued to refuse and was extremely rude in his response. When I asked for written proof of the returns policy regarding underwear he refused to provide it. He basically said it was his decision & he wasn‚Äôt accepting the return.

The online information regarding underwear not being returnable is not apparent prior to purchase and therefore is misleading. The information I did find was after purchase and at the back of receipt enclosed in the packaging. It says
‚ÄòWhat items can‚Äôt be returned?
Underwear and swimwear where the packaging is unsealed or the hygiene strip is removed.‚Äô
This was not the case with these items as they were still in sealed bags and only collected the previous day so also within 14-day cancellation period.

So, after discovering this information I went to my wife who was browsing the store and we decided to provide this information to Dan together. My wife tried to show Dan the information regarding the returning of underwear but he refused to look at it. He was extremely dismissive and basically said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm the manager of this store and what I say goes‚Äô. He then said you can waste your time going around in circles but I‚Äôm the manager and I‚Äôm not returning the items regardless of what information is on the website. He just didn‚Äôt want to know, and his manner was extremely rude - not what I would expect from a person who is customer facing and not a very good example to his colleagues. My wife has worked in retail most of her life and was absolutely astonished at how appalling Dan‚Äôs customer service was. If she would have spoken to a customer like Dan spoke to us, she would have been disciplined and potentially dismissed. Dan kept saying I'm the manager and appeared to be on a power trip. Dan continued to be obstructive when we asked for the complaints procedure and who to address the complaint to. He said he didn‚Äôt have to provide it. Unfortunately, this has really tarnished my experience of Argos and Sainsburys who have previously been very good. I will not be visiting the Colwick Argos again because of this.",0
"Told Virgin I was moving house 1 month in advance & was informed there were services available at the property.
There were no services at the property at all, there wasn‚Äôt even any cables going into the house.
Then went 8 days with no services until an engineer was available to sort it.
Was then given ¬£25 compensation instead of the ¬£67 as promised on the website & had to make 2 lengthy phonecalls to dispute the compensation & raise a complaint via a 1 hour webchat. Was offered a further ¬£25 & was told that was the maximum compensation I would ever get.
The customer service centre (wherever that may be) tell lies & fabricate information & I have proof of this.",0
Transferred and held in queue for ages only to be told there are no operatives. Charged extra on landline for a call when my phone has been dead for weeks. Fault was reported and not dealt with.

"Awful, awful company, avoid at all costs.

I signed up to their Full Fibre package as they had an incredibly cheap ¬£25 deal, however it then when up to ¬£35, just after it was installed, without any explanation.

The service I paid for was 900mbs but I can only get 300-400mbs. I've spent hours on the phone trying to resolve this and running test after test but they won't accept it, they say that everything is fine their end and that it must be my laptop or the cables (which I've changed) or Windows that's causing the issue.

Then I get another email, within a month of joining, that the price is going up again by 9%!! I've tried to cancel but they won't accept, saying that I'd have to pay ¬£600 to cancel.

So basically I'm stuck paying for a service that I don't get for 24 months and they just don't care!

I'll never get anything from Vodafone again.",0
"Well, I wish I had read the reviews on here before I sent carphone warehouse my old phone.

I sent my google pixel 3 in a month ago and I haven‚Äôt heard anything from them since, I know they have received my device because of the tracking. In their website it states the money will be in your account in 3-5 working days of he device being received. I‚Äôve heard nothing from them, absolutely poor customer service. A lot of reviews are saying that they are paying out far less than what they quote to you but I haven‚Äôt had anything and no explanation on why this is, effectively leaving me robbed! Wish I had gone to another trade in site.

I‚Äôve always used carphone warehouse to upgrade and buy new phones but I will not be doing so, ever again.

"I was unfortunate enough to buy a smart watch from these people, returned it within 2 days unopened as the wife had bought me the same one for my birthday.

2 weeks later - No Refund

Called them and they claim to have sent a cheque but that can take up to 28days to arrive!!! (I paid via debit card)

Firstly as stated in reg 34 of the consumer contracts regulations 2013 they must refund via the same payment method unless unless the consumer has expressly agreed otherwise, which of course i have not.

This is a company with major cashflow issues in my view, why else
would they send the refund by cheque?

Do yourselves a favour and go direct to the Network for the best deals, cut out the middleman its very old hat, not to mention you'll get much better customer service.",0
"Bought a PCSpecialist pre-built about a month ago from Currys that had a number of issues. Managed to get most resolved myself then two weeks later the machine completely died.

Just ordered another one of theirs a couple of days ago. Got it this morning and it's arrived with the motherboard not installed properly (or the wrong backplate), so I can't use the ports on the back.

Now I've got to send this back and wait again for a refund so I can buy a replacement. Definitely won't be buying another of their machines.",0
"As a service provider, the leads are far too expensive. You are looking at 40 euros to be one of 5 people that can respond to a job and have no guarantee of getting the job. It's just not worth it. The Elite thing is even more of a scam. I like the idea, but the price to respond is crazy.

EDIT: Why not refund the credits if one does not get the job and only charge those who are awarded the job? That would make your model fairer. There are plenty of jobs that require 30 to 40 credits to respond to yet the information etc couldn't be blander. Perhaps, let the customers know that service providers need to spend their hard-earned money to respond to the ads. Then they might actually tell you what they need. It's unbelievable how an ad can cost 40 to respond to and you don't even know what the job is because the poster has provided no context.

Again, good idea, MASSIVELY flawed and greedy.",0
The internet and phone line is now working well and it is good value for the cheap price you pay so my advice is Now TV (broadband and calls in our case) is a good product IF fully working. Where they fall down though is their employees. We had a minor connection issue at start up which took 3 engineers to fix. The first one left and the same issue came back an hour after his visit. The second engineer stayed in his van outside the premises and did not bother to attend. The third one resolved the matter. We raised a complaint during the calls to rearrange these appointments and were informed a manager would call us to discuss compensation. This never happened at all. There may have been some delays so we called back after the second most recent lockdown to find out what was happening with the complaint to be told the manager just hadn't bothered to contact us. We were assured that we would get contact from this manager or the representatives own manager the next day but 3 days on and we have still not received any contact. One of the linked cases is 08017192.,0
Was at Carphone Warehouse earlier today as my phone died and after being asked if my question was quick I was told there was ONE customer before me and it would take an hour to be served...

I am on the phone now with them and they have kept me on hold for an hour. This is so disempowering. Also the engineers who came to set it up were incompetent.

"Had such a poor experience part exchanging some old lenses for a new lens. After contacting WEX I was told it was ok to take the 3 lenses to the Norwich branch, so I did. when I got there I was told that I could either reserve the lens I wanted or purchase it and once the trade in lenses had been looked at they would pay that money back into my bank account. So I bought the lens whilst I was there. After a few days I was contacted and told that one lens had water in it and they could send it away for a quote to repair, so I asked for it back, when I received it I discovered that it wasn't even my lens they had returned to me. The lens was black in colour, all the lenses I took in where white! All the lenses had been marked down from the original quote even though one has only been used a dozen times and with a lens coat on. Every time I contacted them I got a different person and had to explain the same stuff that they had misplaced one of my lenses and I was also told that the would look after me. They did find the lens which had been put in the wrong order! If I had not asked for that lens back and allowed them to send it off for a repair quote, I would have never known that the lens was not the one I took them! I did ask for a better deal because of all the stress that the had caused and was told they could give me another ¬£100 but they gave me nothing back as more than the ¬£100 was taken off the original quote. Now they said they would credit the exchange lens value back to my bank account but no one told me that it would take so long to put my money back when I bought that lens from them, Due to how I was treated I will no longer be buying any more equipment from them and I have been a customer that have used them for may years",0

"Absolutely ridiculous! I upgraded my phone over the telephone and I was told that my new phone would be with me the following day on Friday 29th Nov. My phone was supposedly scanned and forwarded to DPD but I did not receive it as promised - apparently DPD have lost the parcel and they are now doing an investigation. DPD keep telling me they did not receive the package and Carphone Warehouse keep telling me DPD are looking for the phone in their warehouse. I have asked for a replacement phone several times, which I am happy to collect from a store, as none of is my fault - but I am repeatedly told I have to wait until the end of the investigation to be provided with a replacement. This is a ridiculous process - why should I have to wait for something I have paid an upfront cost for because of faults in the delivery system implemented by Carphone Warehouse and DPD??? Surely Carphone Warehouse could issue me with a replacement and claim the upfront cost for the original phone from DPD, or have the original phone returned to them (if it is ever found, which is highly unlikely)? I don't see why I should have to wait for a replacement when I have paid and i am currently paying for my upgraded contract?!! I have used Carphone Warehouse for 6+ years and the service I have received this week has been shocking and pathetic!!",0

"Absolutely appalling, has disgusting customer care and loyalty. Disrespectful indeed. I am now leaving Virgin Media and am making complaints elsewhere as the COMPLAINT SYSTEM OF VIRGIN MEDIA IS NOT FIT FOR PURPOSES! To date I have five outstanding complaints and these complaints could have been dealt with easily. They have cancelled one complaint without my knowledge or consent. I am NEVER going back to Virgin Media and will be contacting TV trading programmes and members of Parliament to expose Virgin Media to put an end to their disgraceful behaviour.

YOU ASK WHAT WENT WRONG? I am coming to the end of the contact yet give them the change to give me a cheaper price or the same price I'm paying for my Broadband. I have been a loyal customer. They failed. Within this contract they boosted the wifi speeds but they want me to pay more now even though I did not ask for faster speeds. Now they want ¬£33.00 and not the ¬£23.00 I was supposed to be paying. Although I was only suppose to pay ¬£23.00, throughout my contract they were taking ¬£26.25 off me. I called them today and have cancelled my contract. I am appalled and feel disgusted with them. So much for customer loyalty eh! Lastly although you pay in advance they want a final payment of ¬£36.00 from me but said they would reimburse that payment, so they want me to pay something I do not owe although they were told I am on half pay at the moment due to maternity leave, its money I have not got. Virgin Media did get back in touch and offered as follow:

(1). 'M125 broadband and weekend chatter for ¬£24.75 per month with a recurring credit of ¬£5 until the new contract ends so that the package price will ¬£19.75 for 18-Months.
(2) Goodwill gesture for the price increase we can offer you a one off credit of ¬£36.00

I did agree to the above the same day of their offer via re-confirming this agreement to same email address but had no reply. I telephoned Virgin Media to see what was going on and as it was 3-days later they told me that the offer was no longer valid as it was several days later! Virgin Media are pathetic and shameful. Virgin Media resolution and complaint team has not helped a little bit; Virgin Media staff is not fit for purposes in dealing with customers who feel the way I do.

"AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS. NOW TV fibre broadband went live on 22/05/19. Constant problems with intermittent connection; phone line constantly stops working altogether; very low broadband speeds.

All of my previous ISP's were providing a good service with no service issues.

MY ADVICE: AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ANY COST. Total failure to respond to, or resolve, customer complaints. Hours wasted on phone calls to NOW TV. Incompetent staff. No customer service whatsoever. Matter still not resolved after more than 6 months!",0
"The cancellation process is painfully long-winded.

My current broadband provider was down in the area and so we bought a plug & go Three 5G hub. Worked great, no issue with that.

However, the 5G box was a temporary solution while Virgin made the necessary fixes. When I ring up to cancel my 5G as my current network got up and running sooner the cancellation process was a hassle.

It took 4 colleagues over the space of 30 minutes to get me to the right person and cancel the product which is tiresome. It should take no more than 5-10 mins over the phone, less if a customer could do it online.",0

"Absolutely shocking service. I have been a customer for nearly 8 years and the service has just gone down hill.

I have had problems with my speed for months, I am paying a lot of money for 500mpbs and I am not getting anywhere near this. I have spoken to virgin about the problems, I have done everything they have advised on their guidance and nothing works. It‚Äôs truly shocking!! They tell me they are doing things but it doesn‚Äôt seem to improve. I think they just fob me off.

Today I decided to see if an upgrade to a higher speed would improve my broadband speeds. Anyways I go onto MY account (not on the home page or new customer page) and click upgrades. I find a deal and I select it and it very kindly sends me that offer by email, so I ring up virgin to see if I can get this deal or possibly even better. The advisor told me that that deal I had found was incorrect and he couldn‚Äôt get it for that price or less, even though I had it right in front of me by email. I advised him I was unhappy with my service and instead of leaving, I was looking to upgrade to see if that would help and I was just told that I am in contract and would need to pay over ¬£200.00 if I wanted to leave. I felt honestly disgusted at that level of service and felt like I was treated like a liar even though I had all the details in front of me by email. The advisor also asked if I would like technical support with the issues with the service, which made me concerned considering I had already spoken to someone else who logged a so called ‚Äòspeed complaint‚Äô so it made me wonder if this so called speed complaint had even been logged.

Anyways i end that call and this point I‚Äôm pretty angry so I call back to make an official complaint, anyways the lady on the phone tells me I can‚Äôt make a complaint by phone which is completely false considering it states you can make a complaint by phone on their website. When I advise her of this, she tells me she will transfer me instead hangs up the phone. So I try this messaging service for my complaint, which is absolutely shocking. Do not use it.

I explained everything on this chat thing and the advisors take ages to respond and if you don‚Äôt respond quick enough, they leave the conversation and you have to start again with someone else. I have spent all day on this chat whilst working full time explaining everything to several people. So I would spend ages writing out my complaint, trying to get answers and these advisor are just leaving all the time and new ones are joining so I‚Äôm not getting any answers to what I am asking, instead they just apologise telling me they will resolve this all while not resolving anything. I don‚Äôt know how many times I asked if a complaint had been logged or asked the same question so many times. At 7:00 at night after being on the call since 8:30 in the morning I finally have a case number however I couldn‚Äôt tell you what has been logged as the email just states ‚Äúbroadband - faults - other‚Äù and the resolved bit says ‚Äúbilling corrected‚Äù. So is the complaint resolved, what so called billing has been corrected? This hasn‚Äôt been agreed with me.

I will be taking this to the ombudsman next as this is truly shocking from virgin. I am paying nearly ¬£50 for broadband and I‚Äôm not getting anywhere near what I am paying, they offer things to you they can‚Äôt honour and then fob you off with excuses. Also don‚Äôt mention complaints over the phone, they just put the phone down on you and don‚Äôt want to know.",0

Hi Martin Band. Thanks for your message, my name is Melisa T. I've got your account up in front of me now and I'm looking into your query, I'll be right with you.

thanks

Sorry, could you please send me your account number?

5056220

Thank you, I will be right back.

When it comes to your estimated bills, this was happened because you have not submitted your readings on time. That is really important so that you can receive your actual bills with actual readings. For example, your next bill is on the 10/01/2023 and it is the best to submit your readings 2 days before that day. As soon as you submit them on time you will receive actual bill with recalculation. Because of this you are receiving your estimated bills. So, today is not best day for submitting. It will be perfect to submit your readings on the 08/01/2023 so that you can receive actual bill with a recalculation.

I hope this helped. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

that isnt evry easy for us to do it is arental house and not always easy tyo get acces sthe alast reading was misread by the temnants which is why I went in last Friday to get the readings. They are supoosed to be smart meters but you are apparently unable to dget the readings I am doing my best to supply them but. Can you not take this reading now ? the difference is significant + 600 I beleive is around ¬£900

Apparently your meter readers have entered the property several times recently so you are I woul;d assume in control of wh e the readings are taken

are you still there ?

Yes , I am. Please give me few minutes to answer to you.

OK

I understand sir, but in order to receive your actual bill, you have to submit your readings on time. This is really important so that we can send you actual bills. And your smart meter has unfixable issue so you have to manually submit your readings. I am sorry for this.

I can submit your readings today if you want but you have t know that this day is not perfect to receive actual bill.

Yes please please submit this for the gas 04361 for today. Also can you advise have your operatives or someone who reports to Shell been reading the meters I was advised on Friday that people had visited several times to read the meters? This was not the managing agents.

Give me few minutes please. I will be right back.

OK

Hi back, I have just successfully submit your gas reading for you. It was valid and ok. Also, when it comes to your second query, I do not see any engineers appointments in my system, but you can contact SMS department directly and ask what was happened. I will provide you with contact details right now: 0330 094 5231 SMS

Please, if you can give me a review and 5 stars, like feedback for my work with you today. I appreciate it a lot, many thanks.

"I wanted an unlocked Motorola phone. It looked as though Currys/Carphone warehouse at Burton on Trent had one in stock.
I went on 13th September. I waited for nearly 30 mins. Information was scanty. But I decided to buy. I was asked name, address, dob etc to be entered into the computer. Then the same questions again for a tablet. I was told I needed a charger (cost ¬£17-99). But the bill suggested I‚Äôd been charged ¬£19-99. However the bill was not itemised and the salesperson said I could not add up.
When I got home I found plug and charger were included so my purchase of the charger was unnecessary.
I wrote a letter of complaint to Currys (no reply or acknowledgement yet) and returned to the shop a week later. Currys staff, while perfectly pleasant, could not help. I‚Äôd have to return (18 mile journey) when the Carphone warehouse till was open. I said I did not require the refund immediately but could he take back the charger and just give me a receipt on paper to show that I had returned it and the rest could be dealt with by letter/phone. This was beyond the capacity of the system
In the hope someone from the firm is reading, the reference number on the diminutive bill is Ref435451860/175450640].

Later. I contacted Mohammed but he may be AI rather than a real person. Believe it or not I am asked to give all the information again that I've given them
already.

4 Oct. I sent a written complaint by post. A few days later I was phoned while out. A message was left but spoken so fast that it was hard to hear who it was from and 5 replays were necessary to catch the phone number and the reference number. I phoned - usual hurdles. Attentive listening (eventually) but no action. I'm still waiting 9 days later

"Please take note to all the bad reviews from customers with BT contracts. BT is the biggest CON artist on this planet. They get you sign a 2 years contract with a promise so much a month.

"Deliveroo has to be one of the worst delivery services around. I ordered a redelivery to my house and for some reason they put in my old address.. although the original address was my current one.

Not one person I the whole team was willing to help resolve the situation, which for me was the worst part... I was on the phone for a very long time, but regardless of this... ot o e person wanted to help, they only wanted to put the blame on me even though their app (for some reason) put the default address to my old one... I understand mistakes happen, but for this lack of help to resolve the situation and tell me I wasn't entitled to a refund was quite pathetic.

"I was offered ¬£135 to trade in my Samsung Galaxy S9. Once my new phone arrived, I packaged it up and sent it off. The S9 was in perfect working order and I was using it without issue right up until this point. A couple of weeks later, I received an email from Carphone Warehouse telling me that they could only offer ¬£35 as the phone didn't work due to water damage. Firstly, let's remember I'd been using the phone without issue right up until sending it so it was definitely in working order. Secondly, the S9 is a water resistant device so it's very unlikely that it could be water damaged unless something serious happened while the phone was in their care (edit: which makes their offer of ""proof"" meaningless since this is the only way it could be damaged). From reading their reviews on here, I can now see that claiming false damage is a very common occurrence and I deeply regret trading my phone in. Absolutely avoid!",0

"Problem with Open Reach who failed to connect fibre optic broadband cable. They put up outdoor cable & wrongly recorded job as complete. It wasn‚Äôt.

"If this wasn't a true experience it would be almost be funny, I've never experienced such appalling customer service and a company whose complaints procedure is non existent.

Purchased a laptop in July 2022 and it worked fine for a short period. By October we were having problems with the speakers, and we returned it to the North Shields store in November 2022 for a repair which was successful. By December the speakers were faulty again, so we returned it once more, however on the day we were in store the speakers worked (intermittent faults have a habit of being just that, intermittent). The speakers worked for a couple of weeks then failed again, so I again returned it to the store as I was dissatisfied and wished to return the laptop for a refund but I did intend to purchase another one there and then.

However, I was met with a total refusal to refund and a set of amusing excuses which, if they weren't a serious breach of then law would be really funny. I was initially told by a member of staff that I had to take it up with the manufacturer, which as we know is incorrect as my contract is with Currys. I then had to agree to repair after repair after repair, no matter how many times it took which as we know is not an acceptable solution to a faulty product and not a recognised remedy under the Consumer Rights Act. This took some arguing back and forwards but eventually when I refused this ridiculous solution I was told the laptop could be sent to the repair team with a request to write off but I had to accept a Currys gift card. I refused this also as I legally do not have to accept a gift card.  I insisted on a refund, and was again refused, Michael, store manager, insisting they would send the laptop off again, but this time requesting a write off to which I reluctantly agreed in the spirit of getting on with my life, but I did inform him that I was not agreeing to a repair, I was only agreeing to a write off and full refund. He also stated that there is no facility to provide refunds in store (which he later contradicted because apparently ""small value items"" are routinely refunded), and to this comment Michael lost all credibility in my view as Currys are a bricks and mortar retailer who are required to provide refunds where appropriate. 

I am blown away by the attitudes of Currys staff and wholly dissatisfied with the faulty product I have purchased in good faith which is not fit for purpose, and not of satisfactory quality. This product is faulty, I have already agreed to one repair but the fault persists and under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 I am now entitled to a refund. I do not have to deal with the manufacturer, I am not required to accept repair after repair as they are inconvenient and take an unreasonable amount of time, and I do not have accept gift cards. The contract of sale is with Currys, the product failed within 6 months, I have agreed to a repair and therefore been reasonable. The comments made by management in store and your store policies are entirely contradictory to consumer law, specifically the Consumer Rights Act, and I am stunned that a large company like Currys is in 2023 resorting to these old fashioned tactics to retain a sale. You are damaging your reputation by picking a fight with your customers and dismissing your legal obligations, if you don't believe me, just Google Currys complaints.

I have been a lifelong customer of Currys and I fully intended to buy another laptop however, these encounters with the store management and their flimsy excuses in order to cling to a sale mean that I am unlikely to purchase from Currys again.  I understand the staff are simply sticking to store policies, but these policies do not override a consumer's statutory rights so they should not be used to ride roughshod over the law.

The store at North Shields Silverlink currently have the laptop but Currys if you're reading this, I won't go away and will pursue this situation until the company agrees to adhere to the law as is your responsibility. I fully intend to stand in your North Shields store next week and inform all your customers what will happen if they buy a faulty product with Currys.",0
"Ordered online a click&collect item that we needed urgently. Order confirmed but within minutes cancelled due to stock. My gift cards, however, were not refunded and now show a balance of ZERO. I waited several days, still no refund. I contacted customer service a total of 7 times and was given multiple conflicting advice like: call gift card team (didn't help), we will call you back (didn't), our gem team will call you back (didn't), we will email you (never), submit a claim (to whom?), etc. Every time a new story from a very polite but incapable agent. Then, I was told that I have to go physically to the store which is far from me (I was willing to commute due to the urgency but it's 1:30hr by train each way). They also refused to give store contact details. Still no refund. Can't believe how poor this company is.",0

Purchased Team Knowhow extended warranty with my TV 4 years ago. My screen failed recently and I had to send it back to have the panel replaced. Upon return I noticed that it had damage to the corner or the bezel that was not there when the tv left. I also noticed that the whole or the top bezel had not been clipped in correctly and was all loose. I contacted Team Knowhow to inform them an their only solution is for the TV to be returned again leaving me with no TV for at least another week.

Customer service told me there's nothing I can do as it was marked as collected and the only way to collect it is with the order number, implying there's no way their staff could've made a mistake and that I was lying. Told me to investigate with the store myself and that they won't do anything about it. Literal theft and the only people that can prove it are them but they can't be bothered and instead have stolen my money. I have ordered dozens of items and spent hundreds if not thousands there, for them think i am lying about a ¬£9 item.

"Signed up for the NOW TV free trial. The site was a bit clunky. I cancelled within two days to avoid fees as I know how these 'free trials' can end badly. Cancelled on the site, which required several attempts but had comfirmation on the screen. A week later, I received two charges on my bank account for 9.99 and 4.99 for items I did not recognise. Contacted Barclays who agreed to cancel although they are still showing (I think this has happened before). Clearly NOW TV surreptitiously signs you up to multiple packages and then adds this to the terms and conditions. Strangely, I had no email confirmation of signing up to these packages but confirmation when I cancelled them. Barclays seemed to suggest I needed to have email confirmation to ensure the contract is actually terminated - I wonder if this is legally the case? My advice - don't go near NOW or Sky unless you want a lot of anxiety. If you get charged for something you know you did not knowingly sign up for, contact BBC Watchdog and your MP as I will do tomorrow.",0

A few weeks ago the unit collapsed and crushed my fingers while I was putting a fire stick in it and running the wire in the compartment at the back you could see that the metal had sheared and how it was still standing before I have no idea. Contacted Argos for a replacement or refund. They immediately got their hazardous items team to contact me which I was surprised at and made me concerned but I answered all their questions I sent them all the past and present images then they wanted the item to check it here in the UK so I packed it all for them and they had it collected by Royal Mail. Ever since complete silence no acknowledgment of receipt of the item no calls no emails no letters just a silence. UPDATE 01/11/22 made me an offer of money or a full refund voucher. They stated that there was no issue with the item that it was not faulty which i appreciated but if there is not an issue why make me an offer. I declined their offers and asked for my item back so i could have an independent engineering report done. They have refused to return my item, they said it is now in Turkey awaiting a report. Do you see the contradiction. Argos I want my item back I have emailed you with 30 days in which to do this, that is a reasonable time. What is important is not the money but the fact you may have sold an item that caused me injury and therefore could to others.
Update: I see Argos have replied, you already have my order number if you bothered to look at the details filled out on Trustpilot.",0

Ordered a IPhone 7 from them in March, however due to being furloughed ! decided to cancel my order. Following receipt of their email advising me it would be 14 days for a refund to be issued, chased them on day 17 to find out where my refund was. I was advised that I would receive said refund on or before the 15th July 2020? (9 Working Weeks! 45 working days!) on challanging their advise, you only receive standard emails each time advising that this was due to the Covid 19 pandemic causing reduced staffing levels. My money was in thier account within two hours of pressing a button on my PC, how can they not do the same!!!
Even tried online Resolver.co.uk (reccomended by Martin Lewis) however still the same inane emails telling me that they would get a response to me within 24-48 hours. This happend twice and only responded the second time because I sent an email three working days after their response stating why do they lie by saying they will do things and blatently dont even bother attempting to adhere to what they say!!
This company are so frustrating and patronising.

Dont even bother with your standard reponse which you seem to post on every single one star review. Do you really think that we have not contacted your customer services, to try and resolve these issues.

Update 15th July 2020: Quick Mobile Fix didn't refund my money when they stated on the above date, so I therefore resorted to contacting my bank to assist in getting my money back as I paid with my Debit Card. Thankfully they were able to obtain my money the next day and is in my account now. Thank you Quick Mobile Fix for your inaction in attaining my refund, Your efforts only suceed in giving your customers the impression that you don't give a damn!",0

This is meant to be a no contract service (which I haven‚Äôt had for 2 months) when I checked my bank today now tv have taken a payment. when you try and contact them you can only talk to people about broadband or you get the phone put down on you. I need to know how to get my money back as I don‚Äôt use your service anymore because of all the problems you get with it. If this is not sorted it will be taken to trading standards as you are stealing money for a service you don‚Äôt use and there is NO way of contacting you.

Her partner has phoned several times and challenged Shell over these charges but they continue to be excessively high based on estimates and not actual readings (we know unit prices have gone up but that does not match the excessive price she is being charged). After spending an hour on the phone with an operative today, even though I gave a new reading, I was told that a new charge amount could not be given. The operative requested that I resend the emails mum sent and an email address to do so, however after sending I was notified that the email address did not work. I submitted a formal complaint to the operative and was told that an acknowledgement of the complaint would be emailed to both me (as her POA) and mum, of course no such email has been received. Shockingly bad overall service from Shell and I can only see this as taking advantage of a vulnerable old lady ‚Äì shame on you.",0

"I purchase the White platinum + GhD Styler on 2/5/20. After less than 2 years, the product stopped working. I had to pay more than 25$ to ship the defective item back in the hope of obtaining a replacement since the styler is under warranty. They sent me back a letter stating that the product is defective and that they enclosed a ''new'' one. Unfortunately, the ''new'' one is also defective from day one. I'm now in the process of trying to get them to pay for shipping the ''new'' one back and hoping to receive a styler that actually works. That is extremely disappointing. Even though the styler works well (when it works), I would not recommend it to anyone.",0

"If I could give zero stars I would. They had taken our Sony tv to be fixed with a return date 3 weeks later. We were sent a reminder text of delivery time and date. Day of delivery, it does not arrive - to be told it has only passed quality assurance! Was told it would be out on the next day delivery, surprise, surprise no TV arrived AGAIN. Complaint made to knowhow and rearranged for in the week as busy weekend, which meant having to take a day off work to fit in with their unreasonable delivery times when most people are working. Day of 3rd attempt at delivery which was given as a morning slot, DID NOT ARRIVE ALL DAY. called 3 x 30 minute wait times. To be told that for some reason it had been added to another day's deliver. We had to contact the depot directly ourselves to get updates. We have had to rearrange our weekend plans to receive the TV. We have now waited 4 weeks to received our repaired TV.",0
"I have a laptop service plan with TKW and as my laptop was giving me some problems, I called their helpline on few occasions and found the staff a bit abrupt. I was advised to take to the repair centre and on handing over the laptop, I was told it will take 7 days to repair which I was not informed by their helpline.

I tracked the repair and on the 7th day it was out for delivery so I went to Curry‚Äôs on 8th day to pick up where I was told that it is not ready and it will take further 7/8 days. Being self-employed I need my laptop, my work has been piling up and this will now cause more stress and no income for me. I found the whole process very unprofessional as TKW did not have the decency to be upfront with the timescales as I would have got the repairs done privately.

They are not a reliable at all so think twice before signing up.",0

"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.
They don't know their own processes and don't make concessions even if they're in the wrong.

They asked that I return my hardware equipment at the end of my contract as I was moving address. They said go into any EE store and drop it off, it couldn't be easier. I arrived at EE and was told that they have never accepted routers etc. so I called BT from the store to ask what was going on and why they had wasted my morning by advising to take the equipment to EE. They apologised and said they'd send out a returns bag instead so I could send the equipment back. I gave them all the details of my new address as I was no longer living at the old address, and thought nothing of it.

The next time I hear anything, it's my old landlord calling up to say there's a bag addressed to you from BT. Obviously they've sent it out to my old address. After calling up again and explaining the series of errors from BT, I was then told I still had to return the hardware or I'd be charged. So after wasting nearly 8 hours of my time. They wouldn't waive a ¬£50 charge.

It was out of circumstance that I left BT, but I'll be cancelling my business broadband and EE contacts now and won't be back again. Treat people better and you may manage to keep some customers. But I won't be one of them.",0

Thanks for cutting off my partner's Internet today. As a District Nurse, she obviously didn't need any warning from you in advance of this, so it is good you didn't phone or email prior.

Nor is the work she does at home in the evening for the NHS and her patients (especially the palliative ones) in any way important, only to their trivial health, care plans and pain management of course, as opposed to what really matters, your profits.

For sure, the important thing is the ¬£14.45 she owed you is now paid.

Fortunately she is moving soon, can you guess who won't be her Internet supplier when she has a choice now...",0

Obviously that never happen and you have to keep calling again and again.
It is just so annoying, they drag everything out and really push it to the very last second and leave you to chase and get the answers.

A week later we still have no internet, BT say they try to send us mini 4g hubs but BT keep putting the wrong address so DPD won't deliver and DPD won't change the address without BT's approval, something BT refuses to fix.

Absolute joke of a company, I would never ever encourage anyone to use them, they have left us high and dry with no internet and have lied to us several times over.

"This is update N03 for the 'Virgin Experience' I've been treated to. As previously stated I got a demand for ¬£312.80 which I don't owe. Each of my comments on here regarding their appalling 'service' elicits what amounts to a non 'response' from Virgin Media, the latest one directing me to a forum that doesn't exist, and a phone number I've used on at least 6 occasions, only to be given the run around by staff who are trained to do just that. They clearly haven't read my original post which details the issues with their phone line, issues I suspect they are already aware of: it's company policy to totally ignore your complaint. With all that in mind I just composed and sent an email to a guy called Tom. mockridge, detailing the whole saga and Virgin's total ineptitude, as per Virgin Media complaints advice, only to find the email wasn't, and can't be delivered. He probably doesn't even exist. It's just one of Virgin Media's fob off techniques. I even wrote an actual letter to Virgin Media complaints in Swansea over a week ago. I included my address, telephone number and email. It has still to be responded to. It's impossible to contact, or pin these shysters down. They do not want to be contacted. Virgin Media will almost certainly answer this post with its usual, carefully crafted bs, as they have done each time so far. You all know the response: we're sorry you're experience falls below our standards...... blah blah blah. Meantime I'm getting demands for money I don't owe from this shambles of a company.

Update.: Their replay is request to provide them with account number and phone number and there is no way to send it to them privately , so their automated replay is another scam it is just for appearances as they wish to set things right, but they don't do anything .",0
"If I could give this service minus stars then that is what they'd get for the abysmal way they operate. After a visit from Open Reach we were told that instillation couldn't be completed as he wouldn't/couldn't go up the telegraph pole and that another engineer would have to visit. Days later they arranged to call between 8am and 1pm. Nobody showed up and there was no contact from anyone, so we gave up after waiting 8 hours. It is very difficult to speak to anyone and their automated telephone service does not recognise voice activation. Just trying to circumnavigate their customer service is second rate. As we were going to be without broadband the next day we cancelled our contract and even then, recieved NO apology. I would never recommend NOW Broadband to anyone. AVOID!!",0
We have both mobile and broadband with them for nearly 2 years and it's even impossible to reach customer service. The connections don't work at all they drop constantly during the day making it impossible to work/use phone or internet. Any time I try and contact their customer service there is a problem in the area or my connection drops so many times that I don't even reach to talk to someone... These guys are a complete fraud and we are in the process of finding legal grounds to sue them for the abusive ways they treat (or don't treat at all) their customers.,0

"I will never use Carphone Warehouse again! I was called by CPW to upgrade my sim only contract that was due for upgrade in January, they gave me a deal with Vodafone that after accepting I found out was a rubbish deal that could be brought much cheaper from Vodafone themselves. Less than 24 hours later I rang to cancel this transfer within my 14 day cooling off period but they had already disconnected me from o2 without another sim card so I was without a phone. Numerous phone calls later to their extremely rude customer service team they just kept telling me I needed to wait, even though I was told my issue would be sorted in 24-48 hours. I was worried about losing my number and not getting a PAC Code but CPW promised me they would contact me before disconnection, well that didn't happen and I was disconnected 12 days after my first call without any notification. I was told by an extremely rude member of staff who shouted at me and actually made me cry, that I was to pay ¬£400+ or I would lose my number. In the end I went directly to Vodafone and they were fantastic and sorted the problem for me, they were shocked at the way CPW treated me and I would suggest Vodafone cuts all ties with CPW. I have been promised call backs from managers 4 times to discuss my complaint but yet again nothing has happened and every time I ring they either cut me off or transfer to the sales department to get rid of my call. I can not believe how badly I have been treated after being with CPW for almost 10 years, I will never be using them again, no wonder o2 and EE have stopped working with them.",0

We decided to cancel contract where you have to go though one department that all of a sudden would have phone trouble and cut you off as soon as you said you wanted to cancel this happened many and every time with different employees
I am disgusted at such treatment and lack of service
And would recommend for anyone who wants to keep there sanity to stay far away.",0

Men delivered washing machine say they couldn't install it due to a pipe still fixed got a plumber who arrived within 10 minutes delivery men didn't wait so delivery rescheduled for Saturday to think I've paid for installation and the removal of the old machine which is still in our kitchen ~ not good enough,0
"First and Last time customer of Carephone Warehouse

Chose to upgrade my handset through Carphone Warehouse website and was happy with my purchase until it arrived and did not match the specifications advertised on the website.

I have no problem paying ¬£69 a month for a handset, but I expect for that amount of money, or well for any amount of money, to receive the correct information on a handsets specifications before a contract is signed, instead of finding out the handset is missing advertised features after it arrives.

For prospective customers, I highly recommend if you do choose to purchase a handset from Carphone Warehouse, don't do it on their website, go into a store and make sure the phone you are buying has the advertised features, as the website displays incorrect information.",0

Filled out an online feedback survey and someone called me back, lovely chap told me he'd follow up on a set day and time.. shock no call. Calling again to try and resolve my issue. Talktalk are an absolute joke and waste of money. Will not let me cancel my contract even though they are not upholding their side of the contract in providing minimum speed.

I message him for lots of times asking where he was and no reply. and a few minutes later the app said i missed my order. The customer service was disgusting as they said it was my fault to miss my order so no refund was given. But clearly it was not my fault, it was the rider not replying me, not showing up and it was the company and the rider that robbed my money. I paid 16 pounds for the rider and the company's fault!

It's now Friday and I have no idea where my items are. I tried to call them ALL DAY yesterday but after about 50m in the call they would just hang up on me. Tried the chat, the only time i managed somehow to talk to an agent they said that they couldn't help me. And i keep trying to talk to an agent via web chat or the phone since they opened today but no success. I've even tried to email them but as always no response.

Every person I speak to says they will cancel the contract and I will receive a full refund. Even the manager at carphone warehouse set me a date for cancellation and refund. I have had neither! I am at a loss at what to do and have given up. I have paid for a phone and con tract that I don't even have!! They know they are in the wrong and NO ONE has kept to that word for a refund.

"Having been highly recommended and sold a phone case in store which turned out to be not fit for purpose, as with one waist height drop my 5month old phone became unusable, I sent in a complaint about the goods and the rude store manager who I went to for help, over 9 weeks ago.

To date, I have received absolutely no reply. I chased this up 8 weeks ago to make sure you had received it and with a horrendous experience on the telephone found you have indeed received it.
As you are a member of the Financial Ombudsman, I believe you are meant to send out a final resolution within 8 weeks? Yet I have not received a thing.

This company has failed miserably. The customer service is atrocious, in store and on the phone. Having been laughed at down the phone and insinuated as a liar face to face with a store manager, I will never recommend Carphone Warehouse again, nor be a returning customer!",0
"Used Marks Electrical about 10 years ago. They were excellent from ordering to delivery so went to them again for a gas oven and hob October this year.
Big mistake. Should have avoided them based on the reviews I had read.
What should have been a two week process from ordering to delivery and installation turned into an approx six week nightmare ranging from cancelled delivery due to item not being in stock to the delivery/installation guys turning up without the oven on the van!
This is the kicker though. After one of the visits (where they turned up with the gas hob but no oven) which they installed I was left with a gas leak on my property due to the hob being poorly installed. The leak was spotted a week later when they came back to deliver and install the gas oven.
During this process I spoke to Customer Services numerous times after long periods of waiting on phone who I can best describe as totally useless. Numerous call backs promised none ever materialised.
When I bought up the matter of the gas leak with them afterwards the response was ‚ÄúWell you don‚Äôt have a gas leak now do you?!!!‚Äù
Make your own minds up folks but I say avoid them like the plague.

Well here we are on 11/01/2023 and still awaiting ‚ÄòThe response within 48hrs‚Äô which like all the promised return calls by Customer Services which never materialised I don‚Äôt expect to get.

UPDATE (Thursday 12/01/2023).

Following my update yesterday (see above) I received a call from Jetal Sharma (Customer Services Manager) from Marks Electrical today.
Jetal apologised for the poor experience I have had on this occasion with Marks and was fully empathetic with my concerns.
The apology was also put in writing via an email.
Jetal also as a gesture of goodwill offered me compensation which I accepted.
Following my conversation with Jetal I can say my faith in Marks Electrical has somewhat been restored and I may consider using them again in the future.
Thank you for taking the time to call me Jetal.",0

The last straw was that today, he had a message saying that his appointment that has been cancelled by BT several times, was being put back to 3.30pm today. This was followed by a call by the engineer saying, yeh but I cannot guarantee I will be there though.

My Dad is bemused that this is the sort of behaviour that comes from a company like BT. He is already isolated enough with the pandemic, than being given the run around by BT.",0

I have spend many hours in the phone to different people to get updates and still nothing. I have been given a mobile internet as a temporary solution which is not great because it‚Äôs unstable.

Currys have now said it is beyond repair and have sent him money to buy a new one. This money does not include money to install it, deliver it or take away the old one.
This is not replacing the product as stated. This is enough money to buy a new one which is on your warehouse but it is not replacing the one in his kitchen.
He is now 90 years old and has no cooker. He is caring for his wife who has dementia and does not need this extra stress.

"Update: I'm still being sent ""We don't want you to leave"" slow mail.
To top it all I've now been sent a bill for another month of services. Yet another wasted 40 minutes if my time and the promise of a call back from a team leader!
I'm not holding my breath after waiting yet another 2 hours for this call.

Unbelievable and totally incompetent company - Avoid like the Plague!

My current contract was due to end this month.

As part of a ""free upgrade"" to full fibre I was sent details of the installation date.
Using their link I attempted three times to change the date to one I could attend. The link proved to be less than useful.
Eventually I phoned them. This should have been a simple process but unfortunately it resulted in a lengthy call while in France.
Date sorted I then received conflicting messages about the fitting date.

I booked a half day off work to attend the fitting. The fitters arrived and informed me that due to the ""maisonette"" (porch over the front door) they couldn't install the full fibre where I wanted it. They left without installing it.

An abrupt follow up call from TalkTalk was less than satisfactory.

As a result of this shoddy experience I decided to end my contract on the expiry date.

A simple task? - not when dealing with this company. I have had multiple chats to cancel. Followed by even more calls to them. Each time I've been promised follow up calls (never received) and confirmation that my contract would still be terminated on the end date. And yes ""Liam"" I was put through to the correct team! As I received no email confirming the end of my contract I have had to call them back. Each time I was informed the contract hadn't been cancelled. Each time I insisted on ending my contract.

I finally spoke to a ""Liam"" who informed, yet again, that I none of the previous operatives had confirmed and entered the end date of my contract and I still had to give 30 days notice. Unbelievable attitude.

After much disagreement concerning the 30 days notice it has been confirmed I am leaving TalkTalk.

However, I am still receiving ""We don't want you leave"" emails and letters, including full fibre upgrades which one operative informed me that they couldn't supply and (another) that I had missed three appointments installations of said (now unavailable) upgrade - not true.

Finally I resent having to pay inflated rates for an extended service that I no longer use!!

As a pleasant aside Lightning Fibre have just installed faster full fibre, at a cheaper rate than TalkTalk were supplying on a copper line. Fast installation, a friendly and efficient team and fitted where I needed it!

Goodbye TalkTalk",0

No skip intro option
Continue watching doesn't remember where you were and always goes to 60% through an episode

"Moved into new house and could only have BT broadband at the time. Took it because I had no option. Most expensive around and then increased my bill by ¬£5.99 two months into contract! Wanted to leave and was slapped with ¬£335 penalty charge! Absolute crooks and will never use them again!

UPDATE: No Dan I wasn't made aware of it when taking out the contract. I was made aware of it two months into the contract when a letter dropped through my door! Funny thing is the price for my exact package hadn't changed online after the increase, then someone rings me offering to keep it the same if I stay! BT is a shady company with shady practices and now it costs me to leave when you hike the price by ¬£6 a month, it's legalised extortion! I am an unpaid carer looking after a disabled relative, everyday is a struggle! I give you 12 months of custom and then decide to leave and for that I have to pay BT ¬£335 when it costs you NOTHING! Router was returned and I was remotely switched by SKY, I asked a BT representative over the phone what exactly am I paying this ¬£335 for and he told me it was a PENALTY fee!! Its cost BT nothing for me to leave but it costs me ¬£335!! Like I said absolute crooks committing daylight robbery!! I suppose the money I pay will buy me something though and that is knowledge never to enter into a contract with BT again! BT is a multi million maybe even billion company yet you charge extortionate fees to leave, its robbery and its disgusting!!

"DO NOT BUY the Instant Replacement plan!!!!

"I applied to join Vodafool for Broadband and Home Phone TWO DAYS ago, and they are driving me literally INSANE!!!

Everything is convoluted and extremely difficult with these people! They don't know what they're doing! They make mistakes that mess everything up!

Vodafool sent an order confirmation email, containing the WRONG ACCOUNT NUMBER!

Vodafool tell me my four digit PIN is wrong, and that I have to reset it at a Vodafone Shop!

Vodafool told me I FAILED VERIFICATION and hung up the ""Fone"" on me!

Vodafool ask NONSENSICAL QUESTIONS, such as ""How many connections do you have with Vodafool?"" ... What does that even mean???

Vodafool's security questions are ENDLESS, and I still failed!

I cannot setup ""My Vodafool"" Account!

I cannot access the Vodafool App!

I spent ONE HOUR on the ""Fone"" to Vodafool, trying to ensure my landline number is ex-directory, and it was IMPOSSIBLE to get any sense in response to this most simple request! ... If Vodafool publish my ""Fone"" number, I will consider bringing Civil Legal Action against them!

Unlike Plusnet, Vodafool's call centre is in India, and this is the first time they've been patronising and rude!!!

I could SCREAM!!! Vodafool don't know what they're doing!!! I've never known such a bunch of unhelpful people! Worst Customer Service EVER, and this is just two days after applying!

Incredibly frustrated, I rang off, and Vodafool kept calling me back repeatedly, until I told them, ""Stop calling me! This is harassment!""

Thinking of cancelling the whole thing! Is there an ISP that's actually competent? Because I'm struggling to find one! I thought TalkTalk were bad, but they have a serious rival in Vodafool!

"I had been with NowTV for many years. Everything worked smoothly until a year or two ago they started to charge all sorts of bolt on, E.g. ¬£5/mth Boost membership just to be able to watch movies that I have already paid for without ads.

The way they promote these add-on services is sneaky. Basically, anyone including children can buy these without having to enter any sort of password. They do offer a payment PIN but it‚Äôs never highlight to customers. So my 6 year old ‚Äúbought‚Äù a few, E.g. Boost, entertainment package. As a result, I had been paying for these for 18mths without realising. There is no monthly bill that‚Äôs emailed to me, no renewal reminder, just nothing. The whole thing is designed to run quietly.

When I eventually found out, they blame me on not setting up payment PIN, even though I have never received and prompt or emails about setting up this PIN.

Such short-sighted and greedy way to increase their revenue. Needless to say, I will never use NowTV again.

"I've been a BT customer for 5 years. I can understand price increases to manage costs, but the latest round is higher than RPI. I understand they calculate from CPI, but considering most contracts will allow a termination if increases are higher than RPI, it's pretty crappy of BT when everyone is struggling with bills. I wrote to complain and got told (nicely) to spin on it with a canned response. I guess even long-term customers aren't worth the hassle of pre-emptive retention.

I'm 4 months from my contract end and given there was no attempt at negotiating the increase, I'll be moving to another competitor I have in mind who don't increase their prices, ever, once you sign up.",0
"This company is the most unethical I have come across. I am really shocked that a company can do business the way they did with us by overcharging us a lot lot more than what they would charge a new customer and we have been loyal to them for several years for our businesses phones. They admitted this is the way they work. You might get a good new deal to switch with them but I'd never renew now that I am aware of what they do. Really disappointed in the way we were treated. I should have read the reviews and been aware.

"Do not order with them. This is the second time we have experienced late and terrible service! We had to call to chase an order and it was very late. They said it was delivered. It wasn‚Äôt! They didn‚Äôt believe us. After telling them till I was blue in the face, they discovered the person had broken down and had said he‚Äôd delivered it - so the driver lied! He‚Äôd actually broken down. Had we not gone on the chat we would have still been waiting. The Deliveroo person said they‚Äôd order again. No offer of compensation. I asked what could they do to make up for the inconvenience and they said nothing.

Our second order of the evening - the re-order was late. The delivery person went to the wrong address in our town. We called him and he explained he‚Äôd been given the wrong address by Deliveroo and asked us for ours and to be fair said he‚Äôd come as quick as he could. He said he‚Äôd report it to his HQ as he‚Äôd lost time and money. The pizza was cold and not how we expected and we‚Äôre very disappointed by the experience overall tonight.

We ordered at 6:30pm and got our food at 8:36pm. The help chat team were very unhelpful and couldn‚Äôt resolve our complaint or offer us a refund.

Last time we ordered, months ago, the driver was late as he went to the wrong address - even though he had sat nav, and the food - burgers and fries, were cold and soggy. After asking they gave us 10% discount - but that‚Äôs nothing to compensate for how much we paid for it and now disappointed we all were as a family. The kids were very sad. I would not order again.

Very bad service. Very disappointing. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend Deliveroo.",0

"Worst customer service I have ever experienced through any company.
I received a phone call to say my contract was due for renewal, I hadn't decided what I wanted to do so I was told I could reduce my payments whilst I made a decision which I agreed. When I was told the contract would be with a different provider I questioned whether I could stay with my current provider as I didn't want the hassle of changing. I was told this couldn't be done so I reluctantly agreed, when I was told to text through a PAC code the message stated I would be charged for an early exit fee. I questioned this straight away and asked why I was being charged when my contract was up for renewal anyway? The assistant told me it was just the way the message was worded and I wouldn't be charged an exit fee it was my normal monthly fee plus a small amount that is added on for leaving the company. I thought this didn't sound correct but as I questioned it I wouldn't have thought a company would lie to a customer.
It turns out that is exactly what they did and that was just the beginning.
I received a phone call from my provider telling me that I would be charged for leaving early on top of my monthly payment and that I had been lied to. They then told me what I needed to do to cancel the new contract and that I needed to ask carphone warehouse to unlock to pac code. I was warned that if I was told they couldn't unlock the PAC code this is also a lie and that they can do it instantly on the phone.
After waiting on hold to customer services for 20 minutes I explained the situation and was immediately told they did not unlock PAC codes. Again I questioned this and said they needed to unlock the code. After going back and forth for a while the customer service person told me ""he didn't know what else he could say to me to make me believe him"" that it could not be unlocked - because I clearly didn't trust them at this point.
He assured me the contract had been cancelled and he had done everything his end. I asked whether my phone would continue with my current provider because I didn't want any further issues and was told not to put the new simcard in my phone and it wouldn't have any affect.
Low and behold today (the day my current provider told me the PAC code would not be able to be undone if carphone warehouse didn't unlock it for me) I have got no signal on my phone!! In a climate where I am relying on my phone for work and to communicate with people whilst we cannot do it in person is beyond disgraceful!
The fact I was lied to twice and the customer service person (Steven Albrecht) also didn't seem at all surprised I was lied to, or apologise for it, is absolutely disgusting. How can this company be satisfied with providing such disgraceful customer service?!
I have never complained about a company in my life, but then I have never been blatantly lied to either.
Do not use this company, they don't want to help you. They just want your commission.
This should be illegal, what if I am not in a position to pay the exit fee plus my monthly bill?! This is how people end up in awful situations because of greedy companies like this who based on the service I have had, I am sure wouldn't care less if I called them once I had been charged the fees if my provider hadn't contacted me!
You should be ashamed.",0

"Do not get insurance for ANYTHING from TeamKnowHow. Period.

I called up as my phone had been stolen. I had already called the police, banks, and network provider to get my number blacklisted so I was happy this was the last hurdle. The man asked me questions about the situation and then entered them into his computer, in which the computer decides whether your claim is legitimate or not. Mine came back that I needed to speak to an advisor and the ONLY appointment they had was in 5 days time for a ‚Äòcall back‚Äô which is ridiculous - and to be honest a kick in the teeth - when you don‚Äôt have a phone. (I had been using my housemates for this call).

I expressed my concerns about how I was supposed he would get back to me. He reluctantly said I could get a phone from the carphone warehouse on loan which only allows calls and texts. No email, no whatsapp nothing you can use to continue with your work. Basically it seemed liked a burner phone, which is unfair when you pay to insure a Samsung Galaxy S10 in the first place. I asked to speak to a supervisor he said there was no one in his office as as much as I pressed there must be someone he said he was the ONLY one there, and the rest were sales team. I stil find this strange and offputting.

He did not offer me any resolutions until I begged and pressed, he was simply going to let me wait five days to even HEAR back about my phone, throughout the weekend. I said I could provide him CCTV and two witnesses who were with me the entire time - nothing, no feedback no advice. Just wait five days. So I am at the mercy now of Team KnowHow.

The customer service is not only rude and short, but unhelpful and uneager to see the bigger picture when someone is in need. Which is generally when you come to an insurance company. Avoid.",0
"The worst customer experience for 2 order within one day! I made two orders today. The first order is ridiculous. This rider didn't deliver my food to my front door and asked me to walk around to find him. And he was hiding behind the building which had no access to any door. He is at the wrong location and fails to deliver the food. I then requested a refund as the customer service team cannot provide me with any. First of all, it is not my problem that he's at the wrong location and I put in effort looking for him for 10 minutes. At last, when I finally located him, he saw me literally and talked to me that ""my waiting time is up."" and took away my food for himself, did not leave me with anything and then left. I paid over 30 GBP and get no food but with a terrible experience, get disrespected and also waste a bunch of time communicating with the CS team.
The second order is terrible as well. The driver get lost and I was downstair waiting for him for 1 hour. Within the one hour, he kept calling me and wanted to fool me that he has arrived. I then insisted he has to come to my area to deliver the food, not a thousand miles far away and asked me to find him. Then he admitted he was lost and used one hour to find me. During the waiting time, I contacted the customer service and requested for cancellation of the order but they not allow me again. My food get all cold when arrived.",0

Sat for 3-4 hours in chat fruitlessly. After 3 weeks when disconnects stopped they cut those 5 mb/s, for which i fought for months to 1.8 mb/s.

"Already left a review regarding trade-in process and received a response from Carphone Warehouse saying they would discuss with me BUT yet again empty promise and no communication other than standard automated response that completely ignores the issues or allows any discussion. Please be aware of any promotional offers Carphone Warehouse offers - they seem great when you are on the phone (prior to sign up) and you really feel you are getting a good deal i.e. I was offered ¬£140 trade in (on a phone less than 12 months old) and an extra ¬£100 promotional offer when trade-in is complete so ¬£240 in total. If it seems too good to be true it usually is unfortunately as in summary when I sent my old phone back got a response (after 3 weeks) stating phone had 'screen burn' and could only offer ¬£35. When this was obviously challenged and I requested to discuss the assessment this was constantly ignored and all attempts of getting in touch with anyone (let alone a manager) to have a conversation (rather than pointless email exchanges which completely ignored my issues) I put a review on here and hey presto within an hour got a response (or so I thought) but again was an automatic response inviting further discussion but only for the benefit of readers on Trustpilot i.e. creating an impression they wanted to resolve the issue - it went nowhere and I never got to discuss anything. Have eventually received my old phone back today which is of course in excellent working condition. In summary; customer service is non existent and no matter how hard you try you cannot get to talk to anyone in trade-in as their calls are screened by call handlers and this is where your call will stop, and secondly any offers are cunning sales ploys to get you to sign up to new offers and then once you are up and running the trade-in offer disappears and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. Thankfully my new provider is fantastic and they offer exactly what they said they would with no sneaky or hidden clauses and their customer service is fab. Anyway be warned folks all that glitters is certainly not gold with Carphone Warehouse I'm afraid.....",0

"No warning or explanation, and loss during the peek viewing period. Just two weeks after a CEO complaint about delivered speed and the network upgrade that wasn't compatible with Hub 3's that caused it. But this company has no respect for it's customers. If they are rude and accusing, rather than remedy the behavioural issue, you get a small bribe to shut you up. This time, I'm sure you will say, well we are improving the network for you, which is a nonsense reply when I pay for a service that should be reliable. But, wouldn't it be a more customer focused approach to inform customers in advance that you are carrying out works that will cause intermittent speed reductions, or don't you have control over your staff or maybe just an unreliable network? I notice that on Facebook VM complaint groups they are reporting TV loss during the England football match which led To my monitoring tonight, and they were told it's upgrade work, 10 December 2022, and your works seem to have ceased just past midnight when speeds were restored to normal. I tried to upload my speed results captured by a wired connection with all devices in standby, (not using BW) to your forum, which no doubt you will dispute as usual. But you can't seem to upload a picture even though you can choose the file and select 'done' like it's sent, but it doesn't seem to display, probably the facility is turned off in embarrassment. Similar with the help page technical report facility on your webpage, that lets you complete all your details and fault description, then logs nothing when you check it!

"Appalling customer service. We took out a care plan (based on their recommendations) for a TV purchased 3 years ago. Recently had a problem with the TV and contacted them, the care plan states they will provide a TV whilst repairing the problem - however they do not have a TV to loan until the problem is solved, therefore advised and assured that the TV would be with them for 1 week only. Engineer collected the TV on Monday 18th Jan 2021, he said they have loads in stock and couldn't understand why we were not given a replacement whilst ours is being repaired - suggested we call back and ask. On calling back we were advised that due to COVID they are unable to supply, requested to speak to a manager, who then said this was incorrect and that they can provide but currently have none in stock, assured our TV will be back within 7 days. Thursday 21st a text from knowhow to say they had received our TV into their warehouse for repair - it took 4 days to get from our home to their warehouse locally! Contacted Knowhow today (25.01.20) to be told that the TV needs a part that has been ordered and will be another week - no they cannot provide us with another TV. Requested a manager call back to discuss further - lets see if we get a call - very unlikely.

Rang again today totally frustrated and they offered me 22nd. When internet works it's great for speed but boy does it drop out alot. Was with EE before and never had an issue but Virgin just take your money and don't really care after that. Bring your call centre into the UK and treat your customers with a better service. I hope more companies get fibre to the house because I'd drop Virgin like a stone.,0

"I lost my phone 2 weeks ago and I bought a new one so I went into the store to collect my replacement sim and they said I needed photo ID but I didn't have it with me so they filled out a form for it to be delivered instead. The sim hasn't been delivered for 2 weeks now and they said to me on the phone that in order for me to get my sim I would have to pay my bill which doesn't make sense because I shouldn't have to pay my bill in order for me to get the sim when I can pay the sim once it arrives. I ended up paying the bill which was doubled to the original price I was meant to pay, and then today they told me that they can't change my delivery address from my old address to my current one as it is part of the set contract which is a lie because one of the workers in the Three store said it would be easy for me to change it straight away, so now it is getting delivered to my old address when no one is living there. For the last two weeks I have been told different things from different providers and it has been an inconvenience for me as I need my sim to set up my phone. The workers at the Three store were very helpful but the live chat workers and the landline workers weren't very helpful at all and it is quite upsetting considering I've been with Three for 9 years now. Something needs to be sorted with the customer service.",0
"Like many others I'd give 0 if I could. After my first contract ended, which was a home phone (Never even used it once) and our M200 Fibre Broadband (One of their lower tiers of internet), I phoned up for a new deal as I was paying for basically just low end Internet for nearly ¬£75.

I phoned and live chatted them more than a handful of times to see what I could do but not a single one was interested in lowering the price and instead repeatedly offered me Virgin's more expensive deals worth ¬£90+. What a joke.

Eventually I got someone who wanted to help, he knocked ¬£30 off, got me a sim included aswell as Volt M350 Fibre Broadband and I settled my bill which was around ¬£140. I withheld paying them due to being angry/really not wanting to, yes incredibly stupid and then fast forward half a month to payment date and they then take ¬£140 out a second time.

Once again, I get on the phone to resolve this. They took my money and then had the cheek to tell me I can't have it back and the only option going forward was to put it in credit. I don't know about you guys, but my money is my money and this is really borderline theft to me.

After Christmas I will definitely be cancelling my contract and running as far away from this scummy company as possible.

Please note, not all employees are terrible but if anything ever goes wrong good luck trying to find someone who genuinely wants to help.",0

"They offer a virtual cloud landline product on their website called One Net Anywhere.

I would not normally reply to a reply but How lazy. U have replied and left a link that gives no help. Just the same generic phone number as previous.

"On 28th November 2019 I ordered a Pixel 3a as the price had gone down and could get next day delivery. Nothing turned up so left it a while before contacting Carphone, they said they parcel had gone missing and they would refund me.

Day by day went on checking to see if my refund appeared back on credit card,,,,nothing.

Emailed them on 26th December and had to go through an address check. Apparently now my refund was issued on 19th December as a cheque as I had agreed to be refunded by check (which I had not) and would take 14-28 days to reach me. Where is it being sent, via Uranus? Why not just refund to original source my credit card? If it does take 28 days Carphone will have had my money tied up for 2 months and that is wrong.",0

"I switched from Virgin to Cityfibre due to assurances that it‚Äôs reliable from
trusted friends, and the promise of symmetrical upload and download speeds.

This was a huge mistake.

Installation was supposed to be Monday 26th September. I cancelled Virgin that day and cut the cable so the engineers didn‚Äôt need to drill another hole in the wall. Then they said there was some sort of ‚Äúgap‚Äù in the cabling further up the street to the cabinet, so it couldn‚Äôt be finished. No idea what the issue was, but whatever. It took Cityfibre until yesterday, Friday 7th October, to send an engineer out to blow the cable. I was promised that it would be arranged ‚Äúwithin the next 10 days‚Äù, which seems mean ‚Äúwe‚Äôll bother to call you to arrange the visit exactly 10 days from now, then the visit will be at some point after that‚Äù. That seemed to work, and the lights on the ONT are all green.

But the internet is STILL not connected. The Internet light on the router is flashing red indicating it cannot be authenticated at Vodafone‚Äôs end. It was doing this all day yesterday. I wasted an hour on the phone to be told ‚Äúeverything is done our end, it can go live any time until midnight‚Äù even though it was patently obvious it would not magically fix itself at 2 minutes to midnight.

Quelle surprise, it doesn‚Äôt work this morning either. I have wasted another hour on the phone to Vodafone, only to be told that it is something Cityfibre need to fix, and they may need an engineer visit. But they‚Äôre shut on weekends, so I need to wait until Monday

I have been 12 days without broadband, relying on the 4G backup dongle. I have had to waste HOURS on the phone to both Cityfibre and Vodafone to find out what‚Äôs going on. And now it will be 14 complete days without broadband, assuming they actually fix it on Monday, which is seeming increasingly unlikely. No doubt I‚Äôll be waiting another 10 days from Monday for the Cityfibre engineers to bother looking at the appointment system and scheduling me in. I am not even convinced it‚Äôs Cityfibre‚Äôs issue here, as the connection test the guy did to the ONT yesterday worked, it‚Äôs just the Vodafone authentication that‚Äôs not working. It‚Äôs definitely not the cable or the router hardware, as I‚Äôve tested my own router (with the correct PPPoE credentials I was provided by Vodafone) and other cables.

I asked Vodafone to just try resetting the PPPoE credentials, as based on other forum posts, this seems to be the solution. They flat out refused and said ‚Äúthe problem is with Cityfibre‚Äù. This would fix the issue within minutes, but they‚Äôre unwilling to even *try*. This constant buck passing and refusal of both sides to accept any responsibility is absolutely ridiculous.

Don‚Äôt bother upgrading to Cityfibre through Vodafone if you get a circular through your door promising fast speeds, it‚Äôs probably not going to work and they‚Äôre not going to expend any effort whatsoever trying to fix it promptly. When it does eventually connect, I‚Äôm fully not expecting to get remotely close to the advertised speeds.",0

"Not so much an issue with Ebuyer themselves but with the mickey-mouse outfit of a delivery company that Ebuyer insists on using - Yodel.

I have been an Ebuyer customer over 10 years now and more often than not the deliveries would not arrive on time - and when you pay for next day it is often several days late.

My latest episode with Yodel, I was expecting my package on Friday, with van parked outside my flat with my package in the van I am suddenly prompted to confirm my address. To do this you had to use one of their automated chat bots - which I did and confirm my address (which was the same) and then had my delivery date suddenly changed to the next day - even though the van was still outside - and they said they had no way of contacting the drivers so that's why it would have to be the next day.

So I have rearranged to be delivered today, and nothing is happening at all - the item has not left the depot or on the van for delivery and when I asked the chat bot they said that the delivery might happen in the evening - which is unlikely as I have never seen any late night deliveries from Yodel.

So not sure what to do now - as the package seems to be stuck at the depot - but I don't want to waste more of my time and money going to down to pick it up because of failures at Yodel for which I have already paid for.",0
"I have NEVER had an account with NOW. And yet every month they take ¬£33.99 and ¬£5 payments from my account and have done so every month for the past four months.

"The Windows version of Now TV is frustrating. I am beginning to think it called the ""OH NO! Somethings gone wrong player"" as I see this message all the time.

The customer service could only be worse if a hand came out of the screen and poked you in the eye.

The actual player is a very poorly written piece of software requiring the user to constantly play with browser setting and empty caches. When it does actually work it signs you out for no reason.

"Moving home and called BT customer to see about options in the new property. Since fibre wasn't available the rep said the best option was to switch to EE mobile broadband and said it's great.

Secondly, the rep made no mention of a new account, just made it seem like we we switching to a different service. Imagine my surprise when I head on to my BT account, and find no service exists on my account with them now, I have a near ¬£400 early termination fee, and a whole new account has been set up. No mention of early termination by the rep, nothing about having to set up a new account, and the new service is useless anyway.

"Just completed an early upgrade with car phone warehouse, ¬£200.00 which I knew and was happy with. ( the cost is not the issue) The problem is with their courier service DPD. I was informed the phone would be delivered Fri 14th June 19 (ordered placed Wed eve 12th June) as the phone must be signed for I waited in all day, despite numerous calls to DPD for information, at 13:00 I got told they would be unable to deliver and I should monitor their app to keep an eye on future delivery time. Mon 17th June I remained on hold with DPd for 1 hour! to be told, "" we dont know if it will be delivered today, we cant tell any other day it may be delivered or any particular time which may be likely""!!!! Now to be clear DPD phone number begins with an automated message advising if your not happy dont be rude to our staff!!! I wasn't rude to the staff member but it doesn't bode well, when the company your contacting can preempt the customers annoyance at their incompetence!!! I would suggest THEY FIX THEIR PROBLEMS and delete the message.
So I phoned carphone warehouse to be put on hold for another approx 20 mins and then subsequently advised that DPD have lost the phone ( not what their useless app states) So Im out ¬£200.00 with no product!!!! Carphone Warehouse have advised they would look into the matter, and I will update when this has been done, as its an early upgrade I cant change my mind, however the problem is the retailers and they have 30 days from the date of order to deliver the ordered item (by carrier pigeon if they prefer) or full refund. I have used carphone warehouse before, many times without issue, however I will never upgrade with them again and in future will go directly to an 02 store, where I can leave with my item in my hand. This is frustrating and inconvenient, I have to work and I have a life, should I wait about all day everyday with just the hope that an ordered and paid for item might arrive!! I will never buy from any firm that uses DPD. Small courtesy's make all the difference, if DPD had let me know there was a problem or Carphone Warehouse had kept me in the loop it would have went some way to allaying my frustration, several rounds of phonecalls to be placed on hold and waste a morning is not anybody's idea of GOOD SERVICE",0

"The app constantly crashes, you can only download for off line viewing over wifi, not over mobile data, as if that somehow makes a difference, it rarely correctly remembers where you were up to on a show and it costs so much more than Netflix or Prime if you want the TV shows and movies. Yet another issue with the app is that you cannot mirror to your TV from your phone with a cable, you have to buy a chromecast or Now TV box. Again, what the hell difference does it make how I mirror it? Why can't I use my Samsung Dex/ USB-C cable? Netflix and Prime don't seem to have an issue with it... They just want more of your money to do the exact same thing.

Also, the website stated that the show I joined up for was still there, only after I signed up did I realise they no longer had it.

"very poor and money grabbing.
Spent around ¬£3000 on a workstation build. A small ¬£10 part was defective (LED strip). This should of been checked before dispatched. I assumed it was checked so spent hours trying to get it working.. it was broke.
I had to jump over hurdles sending photos of the issue in order to receive any acknowledgement of the fault.
I was told a replacement would be sent out next day. Nothing arrived. chased with a call a couple weeks later. 30mins on hold.
Turns out the item was no longer in stock and no contact was made..
As I wanted to get the PC back together & rebuilt I instead requested a refund on the single ¬£10 LED strip.
For this to occur I was required to fully remove the LEDs and post the item back (meaning removing fans and many other parts).

This has completely taken the shine off one of the biggest purchases I have ever made.

In total I spent around 8hours trying to solve this problem. Wasn't met half way even after spending x300 times the cost of the small part.

I dread to think of what would be required if a larger more expensive part fails.

This should of been checked before dispatch.",0

"Absolute cowboys attempting to profit from a cost of living crisis. iPad Pro 2020 12.9 screen size, perfect condition as rarely used and not a scratch on it, initially offered 500 which was fine, then reduced to 100!? Rejected the offer obviously, they then upped the offer to just under 200 but I still rejected. They sent it back in a simple cardboard box which got dumped through the letter box with absolutely zero care. Thank goodness I‚Äôm not desperate for money so I didn‚Äôt get swindled by these con artists.",0
"Today at 11:30 am an Argos driver knocked at my door and had already put a large TV on my doorstep, he did not ask me to sign anything or ask my name, he then walked away. Whilst I was checking the delivery label that had my full address but a different name on it, the driver came back to my door and said ‚Äúis it not for you, I had better take it away‚Äù picking it up and walking off with it.

I immediately suspected that this action was some sort of fraud, in showing it had been delivered to my door and then taking it away again!, so I attempted to contact Argos!. But due to not having an order number for something I had not ordered I was unable to use live chat or talk to anyone. So I drove to my nearest Argos store (Basingstoke Kempshott)so that I could report the issue to them.

The staff at this store were completely unhelpful saying that Argos does not employ the drivers !!, and at one point they threatened to have security remove me from the store. All I wanted them to do was record that I had reported the issue to Argos, this they refused to do.

So Argos do not care if you are a victim of any type of fraud involving the delivery drivers that ‚Äúthey do not employ‚Äù.",0

Customer service can do nothing about it even if Argos 20 min drive from this one have it available from tomorrow 9am. They can‚Äôt switch pick up store, they tell me to cancel my order and place new one. I used gift card and they told me that I will have to wait 28-40 days for gift card refund before I can use it again. Argos if full of **** at this point and if you need anything asap just go anywhere else. Customer service basically don‚Äôt exist. They won‚Äôt help with anything. They will sell you story item is not available anywhere in area and it have to be transported from fat but after you tell them shop beside have it available they just tell you they can‚Äôt do anything. I solemnly swear I will avoid Argos from now on.",0
"Ordered ¬£1200+ worth of tools on Friday 11/11/22. Some of it turned up on Saturday morning (rails from a track saw kit and a router set). Phoned up and was assured the rest was coming that day. Waited in all day, nothing. Day off wasted. Monday comes and the tracking info made no sense so I got in contact, the protracted hour long web chat with 10 minute long radio silences from their end, came to the conclusion that somehow a jigsaw, a multi tool, 2 batteries, blade and sander attachments and an entire mafell plunge saw in its case, had somehow got lost in transport. DPD'd. So they organise a replacement. Great stuff. Just arrived, ¬£165 multi tool, a 5ah & 6ah battery and a multi tool blade just thrown in with the brand new saw in its case, no retail packaging at all, just rolling around in the saw's box unprotected. No retail box for the multi tool either, just plonked in there like scrap. Not even bubble wrap or anything, the scarred batteries now look used before use. This has of course, scarred up the body of the mafell. I'm trying to decide if I'm angry enough to initiate a charge-back with my card issuer. It has turned a usually positive situation (getting new gear, we all love that) into something far more negative. They aren't show pieces and will get used and abused as per usual, they're tools after all. But just that first time you get them, you want them mint and in their original boxes when you hand over your hard earned, because that's what you paid for. I don't know if it's a top down attitude, or a bottom up one towards service, but it's not what you expect from anyone that hopes to deal with you more than once. I don't blame them for DPD being useless, I've had bad experiences with them before through other retailers, but DPD didn't pack those tools like that, that's on FFX. It really isn't good enough/acceptable to send stuff out of the door like that.

Edit*
Information provided as requested within 1 hour of response. Still not heard anything a working week later.
I can only presume the response from ffx to a negative review, is in hope that you don't respond to their request for more info, so they can ask to have your review removed as was warned about in the email from trustpilot if you don't respond.",0
I've ordered two iPhone from this company. The first came quickly with no issues. Unfortunately the second has not not been dispatched after a month from ordering. I contact then by email and they explained there was delays in the quality control department. I have since ordered the same phone from giffgaff and it arrived the next day. I have asked this company for a refund however they are reluctant to answer emails. Still no response a week later. Poor customer service. Highly would not recommend.,0
"Wasted a whole day on the phone to them, passed from team to team. Finally stated that the dongle was at fault, said they would send a replacement, then after another 30 mins and another phone call they stated they would only send a replacement if I took out another 18 month contact. All the calls are in call centres in India, spoke to people none of who had any knowledge of shops in England. Given incorrect information. AVOID",0
I cant believe there is a company as bad as Uber but I've found one. 3 mobile you are a disgrace. Tried to missell me a duff deal then cut me off for 3 days due to an internal error of incompetence. Then you ring their call centre. In this day and age you half expect the call to be diverted to another country but these operators standard of English is appalling as is their empathy and attitude. They read like robots from prescripted responses and they don't listen to what you say. I have spent over 10 hours in total queueing and chasing up broken promises its a disgrace. Every time I speak to them I lower my expectations and they still shock me with the sheer level of incompetence and failure to take genuine responsibility. I use the words genuine responsibility because after getting the run around several times if you haven't lost the will to live you then end up speaking to their complaints department. They tell you they will take responsibility but they don't there is no ownership. The only difference is these guys are less scripted with a slightly better grasp of English. BUT they still haven't resolved my issue 2 and a half months later. They don't call you back or when they do they don't call when they said they would so you miss the call because you're in work and then you have to start the process all over again. Absolutely the second worst company I have ever dealt with and I I could score them lower than 1 star I would. On the odd occasion they do call you back and you get to speak to them its only to discuss what they haven't managed to do not what they have done to resolve the issue,0

I setup an account and they charged me twice for the same membership.

Outstanding repair on a washing machine seal. Two weeks to get an engineer to come out and tell me I need a new seal even after I told them in the original repair request that the seal needed changing. 3 weeks later the repair stil hasn't been done because they can't find the part. I found the part next day delivery but they won't fit a part I find and they won't order it. I've had to do some repairs myself because the time it takes them to do anything.,0

"Bought a google 6 Pro on an id contract, after rubbish reception for 6 weeks the phone stopped working completely.

So off it went for repair with the assistant assuring me I would be kept updated by email... so now 2 weeks on, no emails, many phonecalls to currys only to be passed from agent to agent none of which know what to do... a mysterious text last Wednesday saying my phone was repaired and on the way back to store... and then no news again ... I have tried to ring store for 2 days constantly but no one answers...

"Thank you Paddy for the response. I don‚Äôt do twitter et al, so cannot contact in that way. It is the premium service I want‚Ä¶as I have explained‚Ä¶twice..to your ‚Äòhelp‚Äô line staff. I am going round in circles.


I was a reasonably satisfied BT broadband customer of over 20 years, and as a ‚Äòstayer‚Äô was aware that I would be fleeced a bit more than a regular switcher but, accepted this as the price of inertia.
This time, though on contract expiry the price hike for a reduced service was a step too far and I switched. For convenience I want to keep my email address. I am prepared to pay the ¬£7.50 a month for the privilege (even taking this into account my monthly bill is half the BT renewal offer). Can I order it? No. I have tried the online route but get repeated error messages. I spoke to two BT ‚Äòhelp desk‚Äô staff. One, a rather arrogant Scotsman went into overdrive trying to convince me to stay, extolling the virtues of BT and trying to justify the more than ¬£50 a month extra it would cost me, and telling me I could order the email product online‚Ä¶.which I couldn‚Äôt. Part of his ‚Äòstay with us‚Äô pitch was that all broadband providers use Openreach, a BT company, and if there is a problem, BT customers are prioritised! An argument for splitting Openreach off from BT if ever there was one. The second, a very helpful guy based in Truro who said he couldn‚Äôt do it for me that day as it was too close to the switch, but would phone me back the following day. He didn‚Äôt. He said it would be possible to do it online the following day. It wasn‚Äôt.
A week later the website is still not allowing me to order the product.
I appreciate that as someone who has had the audacity to leave BT I am not exactly a priority for them‚Ä¶but this level of customer service shows the company‚Äôs public sector monopoly antecedents.
Someone in the higher BT management really needs to wake up and deliver a few well placed kicks.",0

It realy proves that their only looking for a new customer and once you been hook on their plan you will be trap.

I had my phone next to me the whole time which other riders have used to call me in the past and it showed no messages or received calls. Reading the other reviews here it looks like the other delivery companies are no better. Looks like it's back to directly ordering from places or collecting in person which is cheaper anyway. I will try and get a chargeback for this order and the next thing to do is to sell the worthless shares I bought at their IPO because I believed in the company, but treating your customers like this is not sustainable.",0

"Collection - No attempt to collect on the date booked for collection. Phoned regarding the non-collection, told it would be for following day. Didn't get a 4-hour window when it would be collected sent to me, so phone in the morning, and given a 4 hour window. Wasn't collected, so phone again, got a date booked for the following day. This time got a 4-hour window, and the TV was actually collected early after the people collecting phoned me (a positive). Three days after collection, got a text confirming it was with TeamKnowHow (TKH).

""Repair"" - Checked the TKH‚Äôs ""TrackIt"" site 7 days after my TV was collected. Phone up, as the site was saying ""contact required"" - no text or other contact was made - and was informed that it had been looked at and would get an update. Waited 2 days before phoning again, as nothing had changed on the website and was due back the following day, for an update. Was told I would not be getting my TV back the following day, as there were issues regarding the repair and could possibly be ""written off"". Have not agreed to the TV being ""written off"". Later get a text with a 4-hour window for the following day. Phone back again to see what was happen. Again, I was told TV would not be returned, and could possibly be ""written off"" - again did not agree to it being ""written off"" and told to that I will get an update. Got a 2nd text stating that it would be returned. Checking the ‚ÄúTrackIt‚Äù site, it still stated ‚ÄúContact Required‚Äù as well as the TV was due to be returned the following day! Choose to leave it there and wait to see what happened the following day

Received a missed called during the 4-hour window the TV was due to be returned it. Phoned TKH 10 mins after the 4-hour window had passed, to see if it was to be returned - I had been told it wasn't going to be return on the phone and 2 text saying was going to be, so had no idea if it was due to be returned, or not. Was told it was still with the repair team and the was questions about the repair. Checked TKH‚Äôs ‚Äúdeliveryupdate‚Äù site (the one sent with the collection texts) and it showed/implied that the TV had been returned, which it has not. Phone up again, asked if I had agreed to it being ‚Äúwritten off‚Äù, to which I stated I had not, and that I wished to have it repaired. I did explain with the conflicting message I am getting (TV to be returned via text, told it wasn‚Äôt over the phone, that it had been returned and that it was still with TKH), thus I was not 100% sure where or what was going on ‚Äì the operator appeared to understand my position (another positive). An email has apparently been sent to the repair team, asking them to contact me ‚Äì they have yet to do so, so cannot say they have, have not, will or will not contact me!

TLDR ‚Äì TV Collected 2 days later, and when collected was collected earlier with contact from those picking it up. No contact regarding need to me to contact TKN, or to save me phoning them to discuss issues regarding repair. Told there is an issue, TV could be ‚Äúwritten off‚Äù and told to wait for an update. Got texts saying my TV would be returned on the date it was due to be returned, got told it wasn‚Äôt going to be returned, implied it had been returned and told it was with the TKN‚Äôs repair team. Some of the people I have spoken to have been understanding.",0

"went to curry‚Äôs 26/11 to upgrade iPhone. Was getting a ¬£175 for old iPhone in a trade in and was taking out insurance at a cost of ¬£130.

While doing the transaction there was a glitch with their system and the transaction froze. We had to leave the shop at this point as it was closing & we had been there for over 2 hours trying to get it sorted. We were told to come back to the shop the next day to try again. We did do but nothing would work. They also advised that they didn‚Äôt think we could trade in the phone anymore as it looked liked it had already been done.

We were told to leave it a few days to see if the refund for ¬£130 paid for insurance was refunded.

3 weeks now passed. Visited the shop 4 times, spoken to. Manager 6 calls placed through there customer support and to date No refund as been put through. We have no new phone. The insurance on old phone has been cancelled because their system thinks it‚Äôs been traded in. No trade in amount of ¬£175 has been received. ¬£130 been taken from my account & nothing to show for it.

"Its very rare that i'm so appalled by a company that I decide to go out of my way to leave a bad review, but Quick Mobile Fix are the exception.

In all my time as a consumer i've genuinely never know a more nightmarish company. I waited weeks for my phone to arrive (it never did) and then had to press them several times to process my refund.

The live chat and email are run seemingly by robots. Every response you receive is the same generic response blaming Covid-19 for the reason both my order and refund have taken an absurd amount of time to process.

In the end I made a case against them with trading standards for breach of The Consumer Protection From Unfair Trading Act in that they are deliberately with holding goods and my refund. I now have to give them another 14 working days to process my refund,but if this is not adhered to I will more than happily raise this complaint to the Financial Obudsman as they would also be in breach of both The Consumer Protection Act 2015 and The Consumer Credit Act 1974.

Please DONT use this company for anything, big or small. All they will do is take your money and never deliver goods or a refund.",0

"Purchased a Huawei Mate 20 Lite from CPW in Feb last year, and it developed a problem with the screen. I called in to the store it was purchased from in December, only to be told it would take 3 weeks for a repair - this would be problematic for me, as I need internet access 24/7. I quoted the Consumer Rights Act to them, which states that if a repair would cause significant inconvenience to me, then I have a right to a replacement phone or a refund. This has been overlooked by the company, one agent even going as far to claim that their company policy is 'company law', and that it supersedes my consumer rights. Have been told that my only option is to go through an online money claim, which I may get my money back, but not guaranteed. Have sent 2 letters to head office, both of which have gone un-responded to. Also sent several emails, which appear to go to CS agents who don't know how to read back through a conversation as I keep getting asked the same things over and over, mainly which bank my DD goes from, despite my informing them several times that it isn't a contract phone - seems reference numbers count for nothing with these people. Avoid like the plague, because you'd be expected to go without for a few weeks or be out of pocket when you need to buy a new phone.",0
"I‚Äôd give 0 stars if I could.
Worst phone company ever.
They treat their customers like crap. Partner phoned up to upgrade our contracts, was given a really good deal all fine until FOUR payments went out! Two for our old contract and TWO NEW phone contracts even though we specifically asked for upgrades. We got in touch with customer services and the lady was helpful and told us we will be issued with a refund to cover the payments going out of our bank this was about 3 weeks ago so my partner contacted them again today and has been told that he agreed to getting new contracts and that we have to cancel the old ones but he was NEVER advised this as he thought he was getting an upgrade because that is what he asked for. So now we are stuck paying 4 contracts. Great. Nice one carphone warehouse. Just what we needed.
Never dealing with them again.",0
"This review is intended to protect the public from those wishing to sell their iPhone to mazuma by sharing my experience.
I do not recommend using this company if you have an iPhone. I typed iPhone into the search reviews - the majority of bad reviews are about iPhones and dust in the camera. I note that iPhones are also one of the most expensive and popular phones on the market, so very convenient for mazuma to take advantage of.
Sent iPhone 12 Pro Max (order M8441951) and was quoted ¬£435, they offered me ¬£170 due to dust on the camera and scratches on the screen. An entirely smashed iPhone 12 Pro max sells for over ¬£250 on other sites. I requested evidence, they were unable to send it to me, the camera dust is also not listed as a term in their condition criteria, and it states as per ‚Äògood‚Äô condition, more than 3 light scratches (but specifies no upper limit). My phone met their own criteria. The phone was in excellent condition and I video packed it. I have also contacted apple about the camera ‚Äòissue‚Äô, who were sceptical about the dust claim and have offered to check the camera to verify this (under warranty), which I also intend to use as evidence against mazuma to justify their ‚Äòguaranteed‚Äô prices being drastically reduced. I work in the legal sector and I have kept a full paper trail and evidence. Not only is the camera dust not on their condition list (and contract agreement), the specialist equipment needed to see dust in a camera is not something the average person (me) possesses, and mazuma know this and I believe have found a loophole in devaluing a phone that they know their customer can‚Äôt check. Even if they did send me evidence, there‚Äôs no way of knowing that dust shown through software on a computer screen is mine as it will not show the IMEI alongside it, allowing further room for dishonesty. If dust in the camera was on their condition criteria, I would not have sent my phone in due to being unable to verify the same. I also note that their insurance of sending the phone or returning, if you don‚Äôt accept their pathetic offer, only covers up to ¬£100, so you face the risk of losing approx ¬£15 (paying for increased cover) by using this company and experiencing the same. They think they are clever but I am more than happy to pay court fees to expose them for their loophole they have found.
Upon looking at other negative reviews, I also noticed a pattern with Samsung and ‚Äòburned screens‚Äô. I typed in Samsung on reviews search, and saw this. There‚Äôs behavioural patterns they follow for each brand which requires ‚Äòspecial equipment‚Äô that a customer can‚Äôt argue against. Out of principle of not condoning this behaviour, and wanting to bring the matter to public attention, I will be recovering the money in court for postage (you have to pay ¬£7 return postage for it to be insured, as well as ¬£7 postage to send to mazuma to be insured), as well as any devaluation it has incurred since I sent the phone in. It has been 10 days so far and the phone still hasn‚Äôt been returned to me. No idea what condition it will be returned in, I will update the review again once received. I reported them to watchdog, consumer rights, and to the advertising standards agency for false advertising for investigation. I hope watchdog get onto them following other reviewers experiencing the same as me.

Update 5 October 2022 - phone received back today. It was returned with only ¬£100 insurance after I requested to pay ¬£7.45 for return postage with full insurance cover. My emails requesting this went ignored, so my phone would not have been covered had it got lost or damaged. As per the reply below, I can confirm I have not received a single email or phone call (I have contacted the directors too) since day one of my complaint (the day after they received my phone). I have not even received a copy of complaints procedures to this day. They also never responded to my notice before legal action letter, as required by the county court before the court application was made. Subsequently, county court application was made around 8 days later. In my experience, this company does not care about its customers, or about providing good customer service. First and foremost the entire situation could have been avoided by being transparent about their condition criteria, secondly by being honest and not breaching contract and finally by actually responding to a complaint rather than ignoring it. I have gone to every agency possible to report them and await a county court date. No attempt to resolve whatsoever. It‚Äôs one thing not receiving the service expected, and another not having the decency to remedy.
Update - finally received a reply to my complaint but still no remedy. I found their response defensive, denied responsibility & lack of customer care.

"I recently called to informed them someone is calling me pretended to be from BT to say that my account has been Hacked and they are taking money from my account. Adviser said to me I have looked at package and that you only have speed of 32-36 mbps instead of 53-73 mbps download speed. So he said that they it would better if put you on that package at ¬£29.99 and I said that that's same amount as orginally signed contract for. It will save money as we have put price up due to inflation from April 2021, so he put me on to new package.

After reading the what I was suppose to be, I later on call them to revert me back my original contract and they said that the maximum speed on any package at you premises will 36 mbps. When I tested It has reached upto 48 mbps.

They said they will revert me back to original contract as I did not want to be tired for another 8 months further.

I have registered an official complaints as I think BT has breach Contractually, as they promised minimum of 51mbps and they have failed to delivered and also they have said that's maximum speed is 36mbps instead of 51mbps. In the contract they also said that they paid ¬£20.00 per month for reached minimum speed, so they have not notified that I am on lower speed, but try to ensure I stay on their contract.",0
After two months of no communication D&G suggested I call their subcontactors to find out the status of the repair THEY booked as they can't get hold of them. What makes them think I would be able to get through? I'm paying THEM to organise a repair or replacement so why do I need to ring their agents?. They have now agreed to write off my American Fridge Freezer and replace it. The ones they are offering me are inferior products. I have a plumbed in ice maker and the ones they are showing me do not. It's a complete farce. Why would I want a down graded product??? The model I have is still on the manufacturers website (SXS905) so why can't I have that at the very least????,0

Have requested it to be returned, and if it's not returned in the condition I sent it (photos taken prior dispatch as evidence), they will be responsible for the full value of the phone.

***UPDATE*** Had my phone returned by Envirofone and took to CEX. They inspected and tested the phone and found no issues whatsoever and paid ¬£200. I have therefore reported Envirofone to trading standards due to their appalling and deceitful business practices.

"I bought a vacuum on the 23rd December 2021. It had broke about 11 months in (Under a 1 year warranty) (the warranty is with Argos). I reported it broke within the year.

Now when i phoned Argos. The first girl Chloe told me she would phone me back. She never did. Phoned again myself and the guy who answered said contact the manufacturer.

What is the point of having a warranty yourselves if you fob us off to the manufacturer? Don't bother taking their warranty into account with your purchase as they do not stand by it.

The guy kept repeating contact the manufacturer. I told him i have and they haven't got back to me. He just kept repeating it. Honestly i work for EE customer services and i am in shock at the state of Argos ""customer services""

Stick by your warranty or don't sell items under the promise of one.

Sort your customer services training out. Its a disgrace. Fobbing people off with promised call backs and telling them to go to the manufacturer is unacceptable.

UPDATE: Argos is just bad customer service all around",0
"I recently spoke to a woman about an upgrade who asked me for my details several times just to verify my account and had to repeatedly put me on hold to check stuff. I then gave my mother in law permission to speak on my behalf as she was going to deal with it for me. After about 7 minutes of simply saying my details to her she finally got the manager as she didn't know what she was doing.

The online sales manager (Sean) might have spelt that wrong... Also didn't know what he was doing. So asked me yet again to verify my name, address and number. Then asked me if I was single, married, divorced or widowed. I paused as my girlfriend of nearly 2 years was sitting in the background and she said ""just say single"" then he started to explain about committing fruad as he heard someone else say single...

Now I have all the patience in the world for people who are new as I work in retail but the woman took a liberty asking me the amount of times she did for my details. Would have been easier if she just wrote them down for her own reference. Then to get through to the supposed manager to be told I might be communiting fruad as my offended girlfriend had to listen to me say I was single is disgusting.

The equality act 2010 lists protected characteristics as age, disability, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity. The question I was asked I feel does not comply with this law. Why ask if I have a dead wife but not care if I have a living girlfriend whose mum is helping me with this?

Very disappointed with the customer service I received and the overall performance of carphone warehouse was borderline discriminative. Furthermore I would this complaint to have action ahereed too.",0

"UPDATE.... I PUT A CHARGEBACK CLAIM IN WITH BANK AND ALSO CIVIL MONEY CLAIM. IF NO PAYMENT I COULD THEN DO A CCJ. 120 DAYS FROM ORDERING, MONEY HAS LANDED IN ACCOUNT.

Please don't waste your money on this company.....Do your research first!

Ordered a phone, went over the recommended time scale for delivery. Was given many excuses including Covid for not delivering on time and waiting for item to be checked prior to despatch. I then cancelled order as it had gone past the timeframe for despatch. I was then told 14 working days for refund, could be longer because of Covid, government guidlines, I've heard this so many times. I waited...... and have still not had my money. As with each stage of my order and cancellation, as soon as we go pass the times quoted, this company comes up with another excuse and extend the timeframes.

"I placed my order for my BT internet back in September to be installed in my new property in October. The engineer turned up and said there is no internet connection in the entire building so there is nothing to connect the router to. Upon calling customer service to get the bottom of it I was told they would do everything possible to help support me and get me an alternative internet connection. However, 4 months on I am without any internet connection or alternative service and BT (a multi billion pound company) are refusing to give me any compensation. Let's just put that into perspective shall we, I am paying almost 10% of my monthly salary on mobile data to enable me to actually work, whilst BT sits on billions of pounds claiming they can't give compensation until the order is complete. The order should have been completed 4 months ago and I am still being told it will be months until I am connected to the internet. Will the order ever be completed? My guess is no so they can keep this allusive pot of compensation money for themselves. Furthermore, BT don't even pay the compensation after the order is complete, Openreach have to pay BT, who then out of the kindness of the multi billion pound hearts, pass that ¬£5 onto the customer, aren't they just the best?! Really glad BT have such a good heart and can sit on their billions whilst their customers struggle to make ends meet due to their incompetence.
Don't even get me started on customer service, I was originally forced into a corner and told to close complaint, which I did as I was told everything was being handled. However, after months of waiting I re-opened the complaint in hopes of this added pressure would mean BT would actually do their job. However, the customer service just got worse, colleagues who just don't care and won't do anything apart from 'follow up' with Openreach which always leads to a dead end.

I purchased an item on the 11th August 2022. It came and was incorrect. I reached out to Ebuyer several times to arrange a collection and refund. It took Paypal to step in when Ebuyer then asked for me to post back to them on the 10th September 2022. The worse experience I have had with any online retailer.,0
"Across the board TalkTalk have provided the worst customer service I've ever seen. Broken promises, incompetent staff, awful systems and just general ineptitude at almost every interaction.
I've worked in customer service and seen some questionable things, but the worst interaction in my company is multitudes better than in yours.

4 separate people have confirmed that my policy was cancelled - they lied.

3hrs+ spent on the phone being bounced between the same departments all with cold transfers so I had to answer the security questions and explain the problem every single time to only then be told I should be speaking to the team that just transferred me to them.

Not a single person has taken any sort of ownership of the case.

Don't even get me started on the fact your agents can't even send an email to confirm what's been happening. Or with the fact that a company that provides internet services (including email) doesn't have an email address to contact you on. My only guess as to why this is the case is because you don't want people to have an audit trail of your sheer inadequacy

Edit after reply
Giving the same unhelpful, generic response to every negative trustpilot review. Seems on trend for TalkTalk's customer service. What exactly is the community page, twitter or facebook actually supposed to do. I assume again you don't actually give any details as the company may actually have to commit to doing something publicly",0
"My home broadband was supposed to be installed on the 13 April. I was told a surveyor would pop round a few days before. This never happened. on the installation date, I member of Vodafone and city fibre came to our house. only to tell me they could not do anything as we needed a wayleve form. I have a shared driveway with my neighbour. I offered to print one for them, but they has said no. so I was left with a failed installation. I was told two things, both were lies. 1st I was told my back up dongle would work in the mean time. I have just found out this is not true as that will only work once the installation is complete. 2nd I was told I would get a call to arrange getting this installed. No one ever called me! I have had to call up 3 times, each time speaking to multiple advisors. my new installation date is 29 April, so I am without internet for 16 days! not only do I work from home, so I need the internet, but I also have a smart house, so without my internet I can not heat the water to give my children a bath! because of the incompetence of city fibre and Vodafone, I could also loose my job as I am unable to work from home without internet! I am disgusted at the service I have been given, I expected more from Vodafone. no offer of compensation and defiantly no resolution! if I loose my job I shall be seeking legal action against both companies.",0

He then diagnosed the problem and told us that it would be a week or so before replacement could be arrranged.
Sure enough it was a week before the company called to arrange a revisit.
In the elapsed time we had arranged a local enginer to fix the issue same day

"Would love to just give a no star review, but this arrogant bunch of thieves think that they at least deserve some credit. I have been waiting since the beginning of March for them to fix my Tumble Dryer. Have had messages saying they are coming then then cancel the morning they are due to come with the excuse that they do not have the parts. I have been on hold for over an hour every time I have called in the last two weeks. Yesterday, I was abused by one of the so called ""Customer Service Team"" who rudely interrupted me and asked if I had ""finished my little rant"" I asked to speak to a supervisor and he informed me that there was no need to escalate the call to a higher level !!! I said that under the terms of my insurance I am entitled to a replacement, as they have not been able to fix it within seven days [not even seven weeks, and almost seven months] I was informed by my stroppy call handler that it does not work like that, so once again I asked to be put through to a supervisor. He told me this was not possible and that the supervisor would call me when they had time !!! 24 hours later and no call. Case ref CC4274406 - I am not sure that is even correct as I got the feeling the little s*** on the end of the line was just trying his best to annoy me and get me off the phone. I have never experienced such rudeness and arrogance. It is like they don't give a monkeys about the customers, who are incidentally paying their wages. Gone are the days when the customer is always right and being polite are courteous when you work as a call handler were standard practice. Making people hold on the phone for hours is disgraceful.",0

Mobile app was half decent, aside from intermittently losing audio on various channels at random. Billing and customer service is an absolute nightmare.
Not used their service for almost a year (box unplugged, account closed, all packages and subscriptions removed, and deleted the app) yet still having issues with them taking random payments from bank accounts. Spent hours on the phone with them and they claim they can't find the charge in question. Asked for screenshots of my bank account as proof.
In the end I was transferred at least a dozen times to different departments before getting hung up on while on hold.
Had the same experience with online chat, passed back and forth, had to explain the situation 5 times, only to be automatically disconnected due to the chat being open for too long...
Months go by with no charges, then they suddenly start taking money again with no explanation. My old account shows no money due, and shows the last account activity (last time nowtv was watches by any device) as 9 months ago. Yet still they're taking money.

They are very good at selling their products to you but not so good when it comes to resolving issues. First bad experience was when they lost my device in the post and had the audacity to accuse me of lying about the device not arriving. Then they proceeded to continue taking money from my account and refused to blacklist the device until I got the police involved. That was about 4 years ago. As I'm writing, I am stranded abroad with no mobile data and without the ability to make calls. Thank god I'm with a friend who has a WiFi hotspot otherwise I'd be screwed! Spent approximately 3 hours with customer services only to be told they could do anything due to a technical error. Didn't say what they would do next. Just apologised.

"There isn‚Äôt a zero star option or else I would of selected that. I bought a phone from them on 12th February and when 16 days later it hadn‚Äôt arrived I cancelled the order and was told my refund would be carried out in 14 working days. I chased payment when this date passed to be told it will be refunded on April 21st (40 working days after my request) as their accounts department were carrying out due diligence. This date has now lapsed and still no refund. They have had my money for 90 days. When they refused to respond to my emails I tried contacting through twitter outlining my concerns and they blocked me. In my opinion I don‚Äôt believe they had the phones in the first place to send me otherwise why take so long? I wish I‚Äôd done my research on this company before pressing buy, I have looked at the reviews in hindsight and there are so many people in the same position as me.

Our Knowhow Careplan is still in warrenty so tried calling their customer services number and after 3 attempts and waiting up to an hour each time finally got through. They got an engineer out on the 8th who said I needed a part and would order. He did and called me back straight away. The part was to be fitted on the 15th September however the engineer who came said the part was no good and did not know why it had been ordered! He said my fridge freezer was a ""write off"" and we would get a voucher for the same value as what we had paid for it by email. Well today is 28th September and still no email from them!!! I have been to Curry's twice now and they have told me the write off voucher had been created on their system on 16th but still not sent to me! I even emailed them and they have not had the decency to reply. After looking at previous reviews on this site the company is appalling and seems like most people are experiencing the same problems as we are. So I have now had a huge phone bill, thrown vast amounts of food out and petrol going to Currys. I wonder if I will get any response from them after this review!!!!!!",0
"I believe I have had appalling service from curry's and team know how throughout the past week. Myself and my partner have just moved into our first home together so needed to buy the essential white appliances. We ordered a fridge freezer, washing machine, and tumble dryer and payed for next day delivery. The order came however the fridge freezer arrived broken so we phoned up the helpline and they apoligised and said they would deliver a new one Tuesday. We had a delivery slot between 11-3 and at 20 past 3 my partner phoned and they said they couldn't deliver as the lorry couldnt get down the road. However we had already explained they would need a small vehicle due to the narrow road. On top of that, it took my partner to phone them for us to know it was not going to be delivered that day. So we could have waited in for even longer for this delivery if he had not ohoned them. Once again our order was rearranged for Thursday. We asked for a morning slot so I could go to work in the afternoon which they said they could do. However the next morning I received a message saying it would be delivered between 11-3. Once again I have to take a full day off work for this delivery. Also, this delivery was unsuccessful once again. Throughout the afternoon I called the delivery line making sure my delivery would be with me and they assured me it would be. Then I received a phone call from the driver 2 hours after my delivery slot saying he would not be able to make my delivery due to a technical issue. Once again as you can imagine I was not happy and they said they would rearrange it for Friday morning. Another day off work I'm having to take off. However, once again instead of the morning slot I received a message saying it was again between 11-3. I waited in all day again so they could replace my fridge freezer that I brought with next day delivery, and once again I received a phone call from the driver at around 5pm saying that he had run out of driving time and could not make my delivery yet again. And once again I was told it would be delivered in the morning the day before. At this point I was angry and spoke to a manager who arranged for my delivery first thing this morning and we finally have a fridge freezer a whole week after my ""next day delivery"". This order has been a waste of my time and money and we will never be using curry's again!",0
"Terrible customer service experience. Poor communication. Won‚Äôt order again, which is a shame as the product seems great.",0
"I ordered this great item direct fom parts centre on a next day delivery as it was incredibly urgent. I was completely unaware that it would be delivered by amazon. Well thats where the bad review comes in because amazon were completely incompetent & failed to deliver on the specified date.
Why gaurentee something you cant fulfill. Parts centre dont use amazon anymire they are in my opinion completely inept. But you quickly refunded me my postage & i thank you for this.",0
Orders goods for pre Christmas delivery on the 14th December. Did not arrive in time for Christmas. Wrote 7 emails to customer service Christmas week. Did not receive a reply asked for refund still no reply. Christmas has been and still do not have my product. The worst customer service I have ever experienced in retail. Seems like this company does not care about their reputation. Would never shop with them again,0
"Absolutely awful service, when it worked fine, but when the hub stopped working‚Äî- 5 weeks still no internet even though we were promised a replacement 4 times ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Nothing, disgraceful",0
"Second review for BT now.

They responded to my review asking me to contact their Facebook team. Which was just a waste of time as they could only tell me what I already knew, so why?

Been another week of internet that hasn‚Äôt been fixed, with two open reach engineers not turning up.

They refunded us ¬£50 for two no shows but it‚Äôs a minimum of ¬£26 for each so short changed us.

Everyone on the phone so far has been useless and not actually helped.

Why has it been over a month of terrible internet with no money off or back for the service you can‚Äôt provide?

Why isn‚Äôt it just fixed?",0
"I recently pre-ordered an iPhone on Carphone Warehouse on a Vodafone contract. The first time, my order was cancelled due to a failed Vodafone credit check and an e-mail came through a few hours after the order confirmation to inform me that this had occured. This was on Vodafone's end, so fair enough. I managed to rectify the issue with Vodafone's credit check agency who told me everything was now okay and I could order again.

However, the second time, I had no follow-up e-mail from Carphone Warehouse after the order confirmation, so I made the mistake of assuming everything was fine and the phone would be delivered once it was back in stock. A week later, on the day of delivery, no news from Carphone Warehouse, so I called their customer service. At first, they couldn't find my order number and I had to give them all my details for them to locate my order. Then they informed me that the second order had also been cancelled on their end, despite having received no communication from them after the order confirmation. Further, they couldn't tell me why this had occurred and asked if I wanted to speak the sales team.

Now the phone I want isn't going to be available for another two or three weeks, and I'm not going to sit around waiting just so CPW can disappoint me yet again. They've lost a customer today.",0
THEY CALL ME 10 TIMES A DAY WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOT A CONTRACT WITH THEM I PAID A TERMINATION FEE 3 MONTHS AGO AND THEY CONSTANTLY KEEP RINGING SAYING I STILL HAVE AN OPEN ACCOUNT AND CHASING PAYMENT. SHOCKING!,0
"Absolutely useless. I am shocked at how bad my experience with Vodafone has been. From the day I walked into the Vodafone shop and signed up for their (thankfully no contract) SIM services for myself and my family and a 24-month broadband contract, it has been an ongoing stress. I spent 3 HOURS in the shop just trying to get the SIM cards sorted, then had to return the next day for another hour as the numbers wouldn't register. The broadband was going to take 4 weeks to be installed (I have moved into a property with no broadband so wanted it asap), but I found out a week later that the contract had been cancelled, so had to set up a new one and was told it would take another 4 weeks. I was then assured 2 weeks ago (when I called to check as I didn't trust them) that all was well and the broadband would be installed today, only to call them today and find out that my contract wasn't 'live' and it will be another at least 2 weeks away before installation. I do not trust that this will be the case and can't wait for another 2 weeks just to find out there has been another issue, so I have asked to cancel the entire contract and will now start again with BT - it is more expensive, but I am wasting so much time with Vodafone it just isn't worth the time/stress. The online TOBi bot is useless and customer service is pretty bad/unreliable/unreassuring. I will never use them again. Oh, and their mobile network coverage is shockingly bad where I live too so the entire family are missing important calls.",0
My first bill came in at ¬£62.88 which I found a little strange considering I signed up for a ¬£34.99 package ü§î I will be getting out as soon as I can.,0
"Nightmare, spend hours trying to speak to customer service, or customer don't care as we call them! Will message you asking for you to ring them, spend best part of an hour trying to get through, as customer service goes.. why not just phone your customer if you want to speak to them!!! Wifi only worked no further than 6ft from the modem, had to buy a booster ourselves, no help from them at all! Engineers never turn up when they say, then lie about when they came!! Seem to have sorted it by ourselves now, but worst customer service EVER!",0
"Well my engineer was meant to come out Monday 17th June no show stayed in all day to be phoned and questioned about my house etc and missed calls! All lies obviously the engineer couldn‚Äôt be bothered so rebooked for 21st June four days later with a family of 5! Engineer came out fixed the problem but now 8 days later my kitchen cupboard has flooded, my wooden floor ruined in a rented house too. It would seem the engineer pushed my washer back in too far knocked the waste pipe and it‚Äôs been leaking all week I‚Äôve only notice because my electric tripped and isolation switch wouldn‚Äôt come back on as the leak has flooded my washer plug socket
I‚Äôm so angry phoned to complain to be given a ref number by someone who clearly couldn‚Äôt be bothered, telling me I would get a call back
I will not let this rest so for paying monthly insurance to protect the machine it took 13 days to get seen and then ruin my kitchen",0
"Placed an order, wrong product sent. I had ring up and return the wrong product and get a new order for the correct product. No return email for either the pickup or return have been received. The courier delivering the new order picked up the return said I would get a notification for the return, which I have not. I tried to contact Very as it has both orders in my account. Unable to contact them via the my account app, phone they are just taking automated payments at this time. I tried to email (unable to leave email address in here) and this was returned as undeliverable. I rang their head office number 0844 292 1000 this does not connect either. This has been really poor service and I am not planning on continuing keep an account with them. To top if off I have paid delivery as well for the wrong item. I have now wasted several hours on this.",0
"Poor company, offer you a price and then amend the deal‚Ä¶furthermore then try a retention price. What a joke!",0
"DO NOT think of having any contact with this company.
Waited eight weeks for return of money. Had no phone
throughout the pandemic. They are really inhuman. Go elsewhere. worst company i have ever dealt with.",0
They tell you to message them separately if you have an issue - see responses below - and then that does no good either as you still don‚Äôt hear back from them. They are disgraceful and like others have effectively stolen my money and ripped me off,0
If I could give zero stars I would . I ordered McDonald‚Äôs from Deliveroo and the driver couldn‚Äôt find my address. When I tried calling her she kept hanging up and only answered once saying ‚Äú speak no English ‚Äú she then hung up again . I got a message from the Deliveroo app saying that my food had been left outside my house which it wasn‚Äôt . The driver was clearly not even near my house ( as you could see on the maps ) . Deliveroo then said they wouldn‚Äôt refund my money because the driver tried contacting me which they hadn‚Äôt . As a result my children didn‚Äôt get lunch . Times are hard and I didn‚Äôt have much money to get them this treat which didn‚Äôt even come . Shocking and immoral company,0
"Had to give one star but they aren't even worth that. Trying to get money back on a missing item from a delivery is like pulling teeth. I must have spoke to 5 different agents, all useless and I still haven't had my money back. Their customer service is shocking.",0
"Tried to upgrade my mothers broadband. BT cut off her phone. reinstated phone but with the wrong number. Then cut off that number and reinstated a 3 rd number without telling anyone what the number was. Now told 5 days later that it will take another 5 days to reinstate her number. Have spent 6 hours on phone to them in 5 days. Every advisor promises different things, all unto date are lies. Appalling service. Will be changing all my phone lines away from BT and advising anyone I know to do the same !!",0
"My broadband charges are incorrect. My contract is ¬£20.99 for 12 months, and I signed up through Martin lewis money saving expert so the broadband would work out at around ¬£15 per month (through the martin lewis money back scheme).

However, it seems shell have inflated my contract price to ¬£27.40 per month and applied the discount on top to get to ¬£20.99. When I call up to sort the issue nobody seems to be able to rectify the problem and transfers me to the retention team who can 'apparently' sort the issue. Previously I've had long waits on the phone to the retention team until I am cut off! Today, the person I spoke to at the retention department was very unpleasant, practically shouting at me, and completely could not understand that adding a discount to an inflated contract price is not the same as adding a discount to an agreed contract price. She transferred me to the billing department, as she cannot look at any billing problems. Got through to the billing department and they're adamant that ¬£20.99 is the discounted cost including Martin Lewis discount (which is polar opposite to what it says on the Martin Lewis website). Cannot help but feel Shell customer service just don't know how to resolve these issues!

I've also emailed shell twice, with absolutely no response. Shocking customer service!",0
not delivered. no explanation. no response to e-mails.,0
"I signed up to used Now TV, with so many features added for 'FREE' but after I tried to cancel my membership, it leads me to cancel other features instead (I don't know when I added those features?). Which is a very tricky way to get customers to pay for your monthly subscription as you are not actually cancelling NOW TV.

1. Now TV is very limited, it's definitely not worth ¬£9.99 a month
2. To fully get more you'll end paying so much on top. Stick to Netflix and Amazon Prime, thank you.",0
They refuse to refund correctly. ¬£1 instead of ¬£5 is not acceptable. Do a chargeback with your bank instead. They need to stop getting away with this,0
"We have had absolutely horrendous WiFi for over a year (11mb/s download speed when sat directly next to the router). Upon trying to improve this, they have repeatedly tried to encourage us to buy an extender, but an extender would not improve the speed when sat directly next to the router! When one contract ended, we stupidly upgraded the WiFi to the next fastest in hopes of improving the speed. We are a household of three mature students and so it is vital that we have the use of WiFi for our studies, therefore we cannot wait weeks for an engineer to be sent out so that they can keep us in a contract! When we spoke to virgin media via their online chat, we were offered multiple new deals to try and keep us and when we told them that we wanted to terminate the contract as they were not upholding their end of the contract (and so it was null and void), they told us there would be a terminated fee and closed the chat on us! We will not be paying a fee to exit a contact that is now null and void as they have not provided the standard of service advertised!",0
"Credit where credit is due,a quick response by ebuyer and postage refunded along with a 10 quid discount.
And in the future,offer of different courier. A few more stars gained..

The use of Yodel as a courier is the reason for one star. I did request they didn't leave the item on the front door as they usually do,they did post it in the letter box.

I paid extra for an express delivery and was delivered 4 working days later.",0
"After a lost delivery, I had to contact Very several times to follow this up. Several messages via online chat were sent and a complaint logged. Very closed my complaint after trying to call me once, with no outcome. I then call back an agreement was made. This was not followed through which resulted in another telephone call. Poor customer experience.

No request for information has been received from Very. They are not sincere about correcting the issues.",0
"I paid a premium for delivery on a specific date, it arrived 2 days later. When it did arrive the front cover is printed slightly wonky. After the problem with the delivery I contacted customer services, which was not a smooth or easy process but was eventually given a full refund.",0
I bought an iPhone as a Christmas present for my daughter but the memory is too small to take all the data from her current phone. I cannot get a satisfactory response from MusicMagpie. The emails received so far are general responses and fail to deal with my specific request to return it for a refund. Then I can buy the correct memory size. Buying the phone was a good experience but so far after sales service is very poor.,0
"I have yet to receive my ghd order. Fastway couriers have claimed they have tried to deliver 3 times to my address. They have also asked me by email for me to give them my telephone contact details. I would have presumed you would have given them my details/address and phone.
I am not satisfied with this service. I ordered on the 13th December and wanted the ghd for a Christmas present I have been very disappointed. Fastway couriers have my ghd order and have emailed me to pick a time slot to go to their depot from the 29th of December to collect my order. This is a disgrace. Again I am very upset and disappointed with the service.",0
"Ordered bunk beds selected delivery on Saturday 3rd between 2pm-4pm, we were attending a family 18th birthday meal at 8pm, bunk beds had not arrived, 9.35pm we received a text to advise driver 2 minutes away, tried to contact him and rushed home, he did not know what we were talking about, there was no delivery missed card, customer services had no idea, and told us the beds had not been despatched but they would look in to it! 3 days later, they don‚Äôt know where the bed is, and tell us it‚Äôs our fault for not being in at 9.35pm! on the Saturday night, we were only across the Road in a restaurant, they have no explanation for why the driver had no clue or why if there really was an attempt to deliver a bed, we were not carded, ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è they are keeping the delivery charges, refunding the bed and have no more in stock, Will not be recommending Argos to anyone with such poor customer service.",0
"Bought an all-in-one PC in April 2016, along with a Care Plan.
Never asked for any help until 07/12/20, when I rang to report that I had accidentally spilt something on the wireless keyboard. Tried to clean it, but it wouldn't work. The lady asked if I could backup everything on the PC??? I asked why I needed to do that & she said she didn't know as she wasn't an engineer (?? again. Is it me?) I explained again that I couldn't log in as the keyboard didn't work, and even if I could, why would I need to back up the PC when it was the wireless keyboard that I had an issue with. She had to ask a colleague and came back to say they would post a new keyboard out.

Rang again 21/12/20 as nothing received. It transpired that the Accounts Team failed to let the Tech Team know that we changed our address, back in August 2016! And I was advised that I could go out & buy one myself!! (Really?) And the system would not allow the operator to instigate an order as there was an order already in the system (wrong address!) I was advised to ring back in a couple of days.

Rang again 23/12/20 and was assured that another order had been processed and dispatched.

Sent a detailed email to Customer Services 09/01/21.

Rang again 15/01/21 as I had received nothing, not even a reply to my email (great Customer Service)
Was on the phone for an hour and a half, to then be told that they couldn't see an order in the system, but they would put one in immediately, and they had spoken to their manager and promised that I would receive it on Monday 18th January, and that it would be the Knowhow Team that would deliver it.

Rang again Tuesday 19th to ask where it was, to be told that it was being picked up from the Warehouse on Monday (not delivered) and that DPD would be delivering it sometime that week, but they had my details and would contact me prior to delivery, so that I could ensure that I would be in.

Thursday 20th went out and came back to the house to find a 'Royal Mail' card through the door, so then had to collect it from the local Sorting Office!

So I have been paying for this Care Plan for almost 5 years, and the one time I ask for help, this is what I get!
It appears that I have been given the runaround from start to finish! Not sure that I was given one piece of truthful information.

Absolutely disgusted!!",0
"Would give zero stars if I could. I was waiting for a washing machine to be delivered from Currys. I am just waiting at home and by chance, I saw the delivery van parked outside of the building. But the funny thing is, they were not just arriving. They were leaving without delivering the package and did not even attempt to deliver nor give a call or ring the bell. I assume when they realized that they had to carry the machine upstairs, maybe they didn't feel like doing any work and didn't care if they are wasting someone else's time. You should make it clear if you don't want to deliver stuff above the ground floor.

I rang the call center, who tried to reach out to the drivers. Still no luck. They said they called them 5 times and couldn't reach out to them - their own drivers. And they didn't call me back at all.

I wish I had ordered this from AO. Such a disappointment.",0
"Called customer services to cancel my broadband due to poor speeds, had to wait on hold for an eternity in order to speak to someone. Finally spoke to someone, I gave them my details and then they put me on hold again for a long time! They then finally spoke to me again, only to tell me that apparently their systems were down and that my broadband could not be cancelled but rest assured someone will call me back later today in order to complete the cancellation. 6 hours later, no call back received, tried calling customer services again but decided to put the phone down after waiting on hold for an hour! Vodafone should be utterly ashamed of their disgraceful customer service and I would strongly advise against anyone joining Vodafone!",0
Worst customer service team I have ever dealt with. Ordered a phone upgrade and requested to keep my number which they opened as a new phone line with different number. Wasn't aware of this as my old sim card was working so I assumed this was because I had upgraded with same number. Billed twice for 2 phones within a few days so got on to Vodafone who took 3 weeks to finally see carphone had set me up a new line in a new account so said it has to be sorted by carphone. Because its out of their 14 day window (which I obviously couldn't help since it took longer to even notice the issue) they just washed their hand of it and now I'm left to pay 5 months of an old contract that was eligible for early upgrade! Disgusted by the way a young lady spoke to me too when trying to resolve the issue too. Vodafone said this is a reoccurring issue they have with people getting their contracts from carphone so I guess they don't care about ripping people off and not helping as long as it lines their pockets! Even just asked for a simple resolution that would have still left me out of pocket but apparently that's too much effort for them since they have me by the nuts on this new contract anyway so why bother ey?,0
"Went to buy a phone they had advertised , they told me their cheapest iPhone 7 was ¬£497, despite them advertising it at ¬£409. Got home, checked internet- ¬£409. Rang shop and they confirmed they do sell it at that price. Rang customer services who told me I have to ring the shop to make a complaint and get feedback. Assistant only has 1 job - know the stock. Customer services has 1 job - provide a customer service. Epic fail!",0
"Travelling thru Europe and have used several of their travel sims; only 1 sim has worked as intended and described, the other 5 stopped working within 1 or 2 days of activation or within 15 days (their sims have 30 days usage). No issues with connectivity or network. The issue is, that once sims are blocked they become unusable and throwaway and no way to reactivate; you might as well flush your money down the toilet! 3 UK is deceptive in their description of their travel sims, I WILL NOT BE USING IN FUTURE
15/8/22, contacted their chat line, ""spoke"" with 2 people, explained that the sims had locked up and after 45 minutes I was told to switch to WIND GR. I tried the suggested fix on the most recent locked sim; still locked even though the 3UK person guaranteed this would work! I gave them the benefit of the doubt, SAVE YOUR MONEY!",0

"I placed an order to upgrade from standard broadband to Fibre in September 2021. Engineer turned up as arranged on 3rd October and installed my home connection but then told me that he couldn't do the outside work and connect it as the telegraph pole could not have additional equipment added to it. I called BT the day before the work to replace was scheduled. It was was due to be done on 19th November. Open Reach didn't turn up. My arranged customer service call from BT on 22nd November for an update didn't materialise. I chased them on Friday 26th November to be told - 'GREAT NEWS, the work will be done TODAY'. I think this was probably made up by the call centre person as they didn't turn up to replace the pole. I have not heard anything since. Appaling service - Avoid BT.",0
"** another update** been without washing machine for over a month now and still no voucher blaming Covid for delays.....

** update** took a day off work today for repair to take place, called to say part hasn‚Äôt arrived and rebook for next week. I can‚Äôt take another day off work. Requested a write off voucher as it‚Äôs over the 2 weeks repair or replace, but hear this is likely to be refused as timescale is not relevant apparantly.... another hour on hold wasted...

DO NOT USE

Without a washing machine, blaming COVID for the delay so will not replace. What the hell do we pay for? Takes over an hour to speak to anyone and book a visit. Terrible company and wish I had avoided.

"VERY TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! My friend and I ordered Iphone 12 since Wed (21 Jul) - it said 1 day DELIVERY but till now nothing. I chose the collect at store method - But when I try to chase the customer service: (1) All phone number cannot reach and (2) chat service requires me tons of questions about my identity while i only need to know WHEN THE PHONE IS ARRIVE TO THE STORE so I can go and collect (Why it needs identity: Passport, ID, first line billing, etc). Until now, No info when I will receive the phone. This is unacceptable service.",0

"I valued the handsets exactly as per the websites guidelines. I was given a value of ¬£325 which seemed fair, but I expected that to change, just because that‚Äôs what they do, I‚Äôm not naive! Once they have your phones they count on you not being bothered and needing the cash. So I posted them off and paid the extra postage for Special Delivery as requested, due to the value. I Received an email from Mazuma the next morning to say they had the handsets and would be in touch once they‚Äôd been inspected. I then received a further email after lunch to say that the value had to be changed from ¬£325 to ¬£115 - Due to the extents of the damage. I chose not to accept their ridiculous offer and request they be returned, only to receive a further email 2hrs later to say they‚Äôd reviewed my phones again and happy to increase the offer to ¬£205. I again declined and had the phones returned. Once they arrived I took them to my local Cex who gave me ¬£295. Moral of the story; don‚Äôt bother with Mazuma and the rigmarole; Cex wins and is usually on your doorstep!",0
"back in July someone placed a order under my name and I luckily received a parcle at my address and when I opened up it was a contract phone which I did not order went to store to return it they didn't accept my return because its a fraudulent order and I requested a return label over a call and return it with in colling off period carphone wearhouse has confirmed that they have received a phone and they even confirmed that there was fraud happened under my name

After 2 month I get a bill from ee saying I owe them 421 pound of bill when I phoned ee about what bill they said I had a contract from carphone wearhouse in start of July (which I have already returned within colling of period) and ee still haven't cancelled the contract as they requested the information from CPW and they haven't provided the information which ends up hurt my credit file for 5 months late payment and 1 default on ee account know ee requested for a letter from CPW confirming that if handset has been returned with imei information and carphone wearhouse won't give me that latter as one of there member says we already have provided you a letter which has worked with ee previously and it will work but ee already said we need something with imei on it and this letter can't be accepted.

Update on 1 March 2021
Sent them a email last week they do big promises and never do them one of there customers representatives said he will get back to me by Thursday 2 weeks ago on resolver and the Thursday still haven't turned up and EE contacted Jim regarding bill which CPW has to clear on my ee account Jim haven't replied to them either and no one replied to me on my trustplot email is will all I can say is AVOID",0
"It's getting a star because I can't give them no stars. 3 weeks after our washing machine broke down and our third attempt to get an engineer out has again been cancelled. Would never take another agreement out, better to just pay someone locally. Maybe that's what they want. Ans a contact email address would be useful for people who don't use twitter or Facebook.

Decided to phone the company as we don't all have access to twitter or Facebook. That was a total waste of time as the lady couldn't even find the repair or the plan. 5 weeks to get an engineer. Pathetic. Don't buy anything from this company.",0
Tried to remove a review abiut working for them. The staff are overworked so don't shoot the mess ager. The company is poor to work for in every way possible. I'd strongly advise against working for the company as an engi eer or a toilet cleaner,0
Never received my photos and after contacting them I was told that probably were delivered to someone else.,0
Shockingly bad service. Rude and aggressive call handlers. 10 months left on our broadband and tv package but the router and tv box both have intermittent faults. BT refuse to replace/ repair unless we upgrade (higher price and longer contract). When we declined the upgrade the call handler became very aggressive. Stuck paying for a service that doesn't work but will not extend the contract as will be switching as soon as we can. Avoid at all costs!,0
"Why did I come back to this company? 10+ years ago I had a nightmare experience with them and swore I'd never return. Last year I had had many problems with my broadband provider and BT had a special offer. I thought, perhaps they've improved? BIG Homer Simpson DOH!

I signed up and the day came and of course BT didn't connect my internet as they promised. I use this for my business and internet is essential to receive card payments. So that day I went on an odyssey of help desks and hours upon hours of hold-time to get to speak to someone. Eventually, after an exceptionally painful day, a LOT of lost sales and a lot of heartache, I got internet.

I was paying for the '4G Assure' service, which is supposed to mean that when the router/internet cuts out, the 4G dongle kicks in and you never lose internet. Guess what, IT DOESN'T WORK. The internet cuts out ALL THE TIME but the 4G NEVER kicks in.

We had problems with the service from the start. Constantly dropping out. Range on router pathetic. Overall speeds pathetic. You know the deal, promised 17, guaranteed a min of 12, actually receive 2.. sometimes, if you're lucky.

So more hours and hours on hold to get through to the hep desk and they run a bunch of tests and say, 'there's a problem on the line, we'll send an engineer; don't worry, you wont have to pay'. They also send me a text message, which they say is a 2-way service. Any problem in the future, just reply to this text and we'll come straight back to you, can skip waiting on hold. Awesome! I think....

So engineer comes, fixes problem, internet works for a while. Then months later I get a bill for the engineer visit. I reply to the text message to challenge this. Of course, it doesn't work. NO ONE replies. More hours on hold at the help desk. And hours arguing of me saying, ""i was told I wouldn't have to pay"" and them claiming, yeah, you do.

And a couple months later, the internet is dropping out again constantly. Cue more hours on hold. Another text message which I'm told I can use in the future (I explain the last one didn't work.. trust us, this one will work they say)...another engineer visit. This time he says (lovely guy he was) the line is fine but your router is shot. We install another one. It works for a while. (I'm expecting the bill in a few months of course)

But eventually it stops working again. We get internet for about 2 hours a day, split up into 5 minute periods. Again I try the text message, again it doesn't work. Again on hold for ages.

Also had massive problems with viewing my account on line. For months I would attempt login only to get a message saying, 'we're doing maintenance right now, please come back later'. More and more hours on hold to fix that one.

It is quite simply and brutally awful service with even more epically brutally awful customer service to 'help' you when it goes wrong. CANNOT wait to leave. And indeed am considering paying their BRUTALLY large fine to escape my contract.",0
"I ordered a GHD, which is delivered by Hermes. They emailed to say delivery would be late but then later emailed to say the delivery had been made, which wasnt the case. I emailed both GHD and hermes, I have had no response from GHD. Hermes eventually emailed to say there had an error and the parcel was in transit but since no response. Its been over a week and i am wondering if they have now just stolen my money. Terrible.",0
"I have still not recieved my order, well over a week now",0
"Unable to speak anyone, automated option selection which doesn't direct appropriately and then forced to 'chat' with an agent, but wait for it.....all agents are busy. Complete and utter waste of time. 'Service' what's that?? Non existent.",0
Shocking service. Phone screen died well within warranty. Refused to replace it saying it was my fault. It wasn't.(or they could fix it for ¬£394 - what a kind offer). I was lied to by customer services too. Avoid vodapfone if you can. It's a shame I cannot leave a no star review.,0
"Useless service from the repair team, no communication and no resolution to the issue at hand. Won't ever buy from Carphone Warehouse again as they simply make excuses and fob you off. No answer at the actual shop where I dropped off my phone - just the same music and then cut off - no matter what time of day I tried, weekday or weekend. Absolutely pathetic",0
"Getting through to them is a nightmare but still I persevere because I deserve to get a replacement tv equivalent to the one they cannot fix. They have offered me just ¬£699 when my original tv cost ¬£1300!
I asked curry‚Äôs on line help what an equivalent tv to the one I had would cost and they told me ¬£999.
I am yet to be offered the correct amount and am still waiting for them to answer the bloody phone and not cut me off!",0
"Bought a phone online, I got it turned it on and it was slow straight out the box so I went to a store to return an baring in mind the phone is still in original packaging with front screen seal still on and in perfect condition got told because I turned it on I can't return it and there's nothing to be done about it. How is that fair? Gave me a number to ring which I did and it would ring a few times then just end call, finally got through on a live chat and they picked it up same day an refunded. So why couldn't that be done in store?",0
I renewed my contract over six months ago and still can't see my usage or bills. Customer Service is a waste of time and get ghosted by their engineers email address. The app is not fit for purpose either!,0
"I used Deliveroo for the first time tonight.

I haven‚Äôt ordered a take away for many years. I get that you may be the most relevant delivery service these days but I don‚Äôt really care.

All of my favourite restaurants had their own service until you monopolised the service and frankly destroyed it.

I waited patiently. I‚Äôm hungry. I waited.

And then I get a crap note on the website that the rider couldn‚Äôt find me and has just left it outside ‚Ä¶. in the pouring rain.

Are you for real?

Couldn‚Äôt find me ‚Ä¶ I was at home - HE/SHE/THEY didn‚Äôt even ring the damn door bell.

Really?

I phoned the restaurant. They told me I had to phone Deliveroo ‚Ä¶ and all I want is my dinner ‚Ä¶ not more phone calls to unravel your mess.

And how do I call Deliveroo? I tried the number I found on the net and waited in queue for ages. I finally got through to someone who was fairly incomprehensible who said he would try and process my refund request.

TRY?

I have no dinner. I have paid for it and I even have to struggle to get a refund.

I offer you a choice. Suck up and make me very happy or lose a customer forever. Your choice.

Kind regards, Anthony",0
"Been a customer for a year. My router became faulty and had a solid red light on it. I did all the resets and tested it with another router from my neighbour to make sure the router was at fault. Called Virgin Media, the get the router replaced. Either by an engineer or post replacement. They tried every trick in the book to fob me off saying I will be charged if an engineer comes out as their diagnostic test says the broadband is working.(which it wasn‚Äôt) they finally agreed to send an engineer to replace the router and then the day before we received a text saying the fault had been fixed in the appointment was cancelled. I then spent over an hour on the phone on Sunday logging a complaint and being passed around and having to repeat myself. I‚Äôm now waiting for a call back from the complaints team within 48 hours. All they had to do was replace the router, even by post and would have been happy and not have to waste everyone‚Äôs time calling up the call center. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with them but it seems like no one is steering the ship and that the company is a complete mess. I feel sorry for the staff as they must get so much stress and abuse from upset customers. Worst company to deal with, you can guarantee that you will get bad customer service every time you call.",0
"Received package, iPhone. All looked fine cosmetically but the bottom right corner on the screen does not work, cannot press the M key. You‚Äôd expect the product to be properly checked before sending out‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. No?

"Virgin Media is absolute crap! First of all they promised a free hub upgrade, claiming it will be faster than our old one, we accepted it and our internet went from 200mbps to 50mbps, and now we are trying to get it fixed but the customer support is absolute crap, I've been cut off 3 times because I am ""cutting out"" and then they promised to call me back, I got no call!

Their automated robot customer service line gets so annoying as well, drags on for way too long, I just want to speak to a real person!

Its been over an hour now of me just trying to fix this!

I will be moving to TOOB, thanks Virgin!",0
"Would give 0 stars but have to give at least one.
They are not quick. Was advised a 10 working day turn around on the mobile I had ordered but nearly a month later and still no phone has arrived. An automated email response is all I get in response to an update request.
Now thinking I will never receive the phone I ordered and like others have stated I doubt I will get a refund.
This company director has had numerous companies all of which have been closed down owing thousands and leaving millions of unhappy customers. I wish I had known this before I purchased a phone in a panic. DO NOT BUY FROM QUICK MOBILE FIX you have been warned.",0

"Never showed up for the installation. Now I do not have internet. Ridiculous that they don‚Äôt even let you know that they cannot make the confirmed appointment. Took half day off 1-6pm. Engineer did not show up and not communication from them either.

"Terrible terrible terrible.
Here‚Äôs why:
- ADS. I pay ¬£8 a month entertainment pass only to watch ads?? How greedy can they be. No option to skip them.
- The app does not work with your remote play/pause button
- when you have finished an episode, the app never changes to the next episode - you have to double watch the ads when trying to navigate to the next episode
- the series library is just a big mess. Its really hard to navigate what‚Äôs actually included in your subscription

I will cancel my subscription. There is NO WAY I‚Äôm paying extra ¬£5 a months to go ad free??",0

On each occasion that I contacted them, I was told that they would ""let me know tomorrow"" or ""I will send you an email this afternoon"", that never happened and I'm still in the dark as to what the problems are.

Truly unacceptable behaviour, they take your money (¬£4500) then they stick two fingers up at you.",0
"Been trying for months and months to get the repair plan information I bought from them a year ago and never hear anything back.

Unable to activate the sim card. Waste of time and money.,0
"long term customer. NO customer service at all as far as I can tell.

Intermitted internet connection problems - not WIFI problems. They have no interest in solving the problem. Just direct me to WIFI resolution webpages.

Just seen the update from Virgin. Same disappointment and failure to recognise the problem. I spent an hour on the phone cancelling my contract. Virgin kept trying to divert me to alternate contacts to offer me special offers. Complete waste of my time other than being able to move to a new broadband supplier. They don't answer the phone and just speak of scripts when you do get through after an hour. Useless customer services.",0
Absolutely disgraceful and unetencical company. Some very vunrable people trying to heat their homes and it reports largest profit in 115 years. Pass the profits to consumers account rather than the share holders. Just spoke to them so ready to take money from you no care at all.,0
"I do not think talk talk even wants my business. I have been with virgin for 12 years and decided to move to talk talk a few weeks ago. What a nightmare!! I signed up on line weeks ago and since then it has taken numerous calls, 2 contracts and still no broadband. Today when I contacted them they said yet again they had closed my contract again and asked me to start all over with a 3rd contract. Each contract takes 30 mins to complete over the phone with a third credit check to boot! They said the contracts were closed as as I failed to respond but no one contacted me, no phone, no email correspondence, absolutely nothing. When I asked how did they contacted me they could not tell me!! I am completely exhausted with it all and realise staying with Virgin is obviously a better option as Talk Talk really have not got their act together an appalling customer service access.",0
No broadband now for 29 days. Keep being given dates for when it will be fixed by but nothing ever happens. Person dealing with complaint was supposed to call me yesterday but didn‚Äôt. This company is appalling.,0

"I had virgin installed on 21st Dec. When the engineer came to install it the cable was already damaged so the install guy couldn't set it up. The engineers came out the same day and laid another cable but the service still didn't work so on 23rd Dec I called virgin who said another engineer would need to come out to inspect the problem but the earliest appointment was 4th January so no Internet over Christmas and new year. When the engineer did come out he again found it was another damaged cable and would arrange an engineer to come out the following day to repeat the process but after waiting in all day no one turned up. I again contacted virgin who said the engineer had not been booked and the earliest they could get one out was the 8th Feb absolutely disgusting, they wanted me to go without Internet for 7 weeks. Extremely poor service from start to finish and I will most definitely not recommend them to anyone",0

I purchased a range cooker with a five year insurance plan with team KnowHow which cost around ¬£1500. The cover included an annual valet. Having arranged my second valet service (range is coming up to three years) I asked the technician NOT to clean the large oven as I had just cleaned it using self clean function. Long story short the technician decided to clean the edges with a scrapper and damaged it. This was in October 2018. I was told by KnowHow to contact the company they paid to take it up with them. They could not fix the damage and offered ¬£50 compensation which I turned down. Team KnowHow finally sent an engineer who said it needed replacing as the damage is rusting and presents a danger due to toxicity. He put in the report then received a letter stating that as I caused the damage it is not covered. I made a complaint in writing which I have proof of delivery as they only accept written complaints. I have since sent an email copy twice as Knowhow state they haven‚Äôt received my complaint. I have emailed and called KnowHow over 10 times and never get a response in the time stated in the automatic email. I would never purchase any cover from team KnowHow ever and would not recommend anyone purchase cover with them.,0
"TRADE IN IS A SCAM! i know my phone was received by them 7 days ago from royal mail tracking I haven‚Äôt received payment, no reply to emails, txt or and messages on fb/twitter. After waiting 35mins the most uninterested and bored customer service agent said oh just wait a couple more days

"Took over a week for the engineer to arrive and then, when I tried the machine after he left, the floor flooded again. The only option is to wait another 9 days for another appointment - no washing machine until then.",0
"I've still not received the laptop nearly 2 weeks later and all I get is emails saying reviews us, review us, review us. They obviously choose to use Royal Mail during the biggest postal strike in years so arn't that good at online delivery. That's my experience. I bet they're happy I reviewed them now.",0
"Shocking. They delivered the wrong order. I got in touch straight way only to be told they would refund me in 24-48 hours. I asked for my original order the be delivered but they said they can‚Äôt reorder, I would have to and would be charged again!!",0
"Washing machine stopped working, first appointment available with engineer was nearly two weeks later. Informed a part was needed. After many phone calls and being put on hold for over an hour each time, I visited in store to chase what was happening as the 14 day guarantee time had passed. Still no information apart from the machine would probably be written off and a voucher given towards new machine. Now nearly 5 weeks since initial phone call we have no voucher and no working washing machine. I have made 30+ phone calls, tried to email but the email wasn‚Äôt working. As a family of 5 we took out the policy believing we would get good service.
I‚Äôm really upset by the lack of customer care, how you can sell a policy called a Knowhow care plan and then offer such poor care is ridiculous. I would not recommend anyone buying it.",0
"Absolute rubbish service. Whilst online, I was able to change to variable direct debit payment. No problem. The next action was to request a substantial refund of credit in my account. Oh no!

I ordered a new phone online from carphone warehouse. The payment was paused by the bank as a fraud check - easily solved until someone at carphone warehouse decided to try to take a second payment without authorisation from me or my bank causing a high level fraud warning and as a result my accounts were frozen and cards cancelled. No one at carphone warehouse seemed to care and just wanted to pass me to the next dept. When I finally spoke to someone who could cancel the order I was told they are unable to send any kind of written confirmation of this - even an email is to much for them!!! so I just have to take the word of a company that was quite happy to assume they could process multiple payments from my account without authorisation.... The highest level fraud team at my bank has confirmed this is fraud in thir eyes.... STEER WELL CLEAR!!!,0

He told me "" van driver did try and took a photo to say would need smaller van, my i say not even the right road. So i had to call next day to get it delivered Thursday. called Thursday AM to get it delivered after explaining i was not happy as now i have no fridge Freezer, but i took the Thursday. Got call to say it would come Thursday got text to say 12.05 to 16.05, Yes you can guest at 17.00hrs i had to call and i spoke with Ryan, got told it was for Saturday. That is when i said no more asked to speak to manager but got Sumi a Supervisor, gave me all the chat, had me on hold for 15min to be told then Van had broken down in delivery 12 out of 16 so i had waited in again and wasted 1 days holiday, she understood by now i was not happy and that i could not get it till Saturday. She did arrange some compensation but i said i wanted to speak to a manager. She said that Darren her manager would call me by 2pm on Saturday as my delivery was from 9 till 1pm slot. I will say i did get it by 10.30, but still waiting for Darren to call me regarding this matter, its Sunday 18th Aug so i don't think i will be getting a call DO YOU.

"Shambolic and by far the worst company I have ever dealt with. ZERO stars would have been a more appropriate score. Even the responses to the poor reviews seem ‚Äòcut and pasted‚Äô with no proactive attempt to contact the customer who are clearly very upset.

I am a PAYG customer and was sold an add on 3/10 which I couldn‚Äôt use because Three had a block on my data usage which wasn‚Äôt removed. This was discovered a week later by me and goodwill gestures were made but were inappropriate giving me data which I can‚Äôt use due to the age of my phone. I explained I needed unlimited calls but they pushed data down my throat.

Anyway today 9/11 I was charged ¬£8 for a 20 minute phonecall which I regard as theft. I was led to believe that the goodwill ‚Äòeat all you can‚Äô included unlimited calls. Apparently it‚Äôs just data, which I had previously explained was no good to me, as I needed unlimited calls - which I thought had been granted.

A 2 hour web chat hasn‚Äôt resolved the issue and despite a heavy complaint, all I wanted was an ¬£8 refund. Three still tried to sell me more inappropriate addons including data. I must have repeated myself 5 times and they still did not understand the point of my complaint.

Between 3/10 and today I have spent over 7 hours webchatting with Three. With disinterested advisors who were clearly chatting to several customers simultaneously. Also repeating the same information over and over again, culminating with trying to upsell to a customer who was complaining and very upset.

Why anybody who has touched this company, with its underhand tactics, uncompetitive prices, lack of transparent plans, poor website and shambolic customer service, is still tolerating this level of service is beyond me.",0
Terrible company who basically rob you. Tonight waiting outside for my order as it was close. Tracker changed to delivered and I recieved no food. I even messaged the driver and he didn't respond.

"Disgusting and shameful service. I wouldn't even give one star if system allows. Their engineers came to install the broadband cable for BT, should call them cowboys rather than engineers. Damaged my central heating pipe which was repaired later on. To repair that they had to make a big hole in my internal wall and promised that it will be fixed. More than 3 months passed now and neither BT nor Openreach taking the responsibility. BT says it's Openreach responsibility and Openreach never responds. When ever I get a response it's the same people from both sides hence BT says we got nothing to do with Openreach. Made countless calls and loads of emails with no solution untill today.

Forward another week to the 18th and no sign of any refund. Called the 0800 number and spoke to a rude South African who advised that I would have to email in my bank statement to prove that I'd not received the refund, what's that all about!
Called back again in the afternoon hoping to speak to someone more helpful which I did. The new adviser said that the refund had been arranged but was still sitting on their system as it had not been automatically processed. She did it manually, so I now have to wait another 3 - 5 days to get it back, not sure what would have happened if I'd not chased them up to find out what was going on.
So to sum up they've had ¬£300 of my money for a fortnight, I've had to call them on 5 different occasions and the sum result of this? Back where I started!
I cannot believe what a saga this has been trying to buy a phone from a company that specialises in phones! Incompetence and uselessness all round.

I went into the Lewisham store to ask about upgrading to Galaxy S10 and was told the Galaxy A70 was almost as good. I agreed to taking the phone. I was not shown, given or sent a contract via email

I then did some research and found out that the Galaxy S10 is quite a bit better. I went back to the store two days later to exchange for the S10 and was told there is no 14 day return policy for 02 contracts. I was not told this at the time and was only asked if I was sure I wanted the phone after changing my mind about taking the white handset instead of the black. The person who upgraded now denies that I asked about the S10 and saying that he told me I could not bring it back

I've now deactivated my account with Deliveroo and requested a refund, but its doubtful they will give one.

I do have them acknowledging the credit however which is an admission that items were missing as per my complaint so next steps are to log a case with Paypal through whom I paid which if successful will result in the entire transaction being refunded. Paypal has buyers protection for items not being delivered and other payment providers also give similar protections.

"#AVOIDARGOS this festive season and for live if you have ears

This is a riff-raff company with staff that will create all sort of lies against you when you stand up to them.

I bought a TV from this riff-raff Argos store at Gallagher Retail Park, Coventry. Took it home and discovered it had a couple of faults. Took it back within 28 days, and some illiterates in front of the counter refused to return my money, asking me to contact the manufacturer for assistance. What a bag of rubbish

#AVOIDARGOS in its entirety. Instead, you should shop at Currys for great customer support, cheaper prices and respect for the implementation of consumer rights legislation. Spend your money where you are respected.

Whilst I was in the shop, I witnessed someone from the Asian background returning a product and no questions were asked. Some people have the right to return products without any questions asked, whilst others don't. Be warned

I had some stupid, ignorant and uneducated staff with regard to consumer legislation, trying hard to get at me for standing up to their nonsense and rubbish. However, I did not use any abusive words, but they claimed I was being abusive for standing up to their riff-raff attitude. What a shame. But that is what you get from illiterates

Bought the TV on the 13th November 2022 and took it back on the 9th Dec 2022. Under the consumer legislation, I have the right to return the TV within 30 days, even it had no fault. I am sharing this information to warn any unsuspecting prospects.

Before I could realise, a scruffy looking security guard, very unkempt, was being asked to make a video of me, collect the TV and returned it to me by the door. But I had made evident pictures and also a video of them. So, I left, allowing the TV in their hands.

I won't reveal the next stage here, as I am simply here to warn other unsuspecting customers to be aware of the way Argos treats customers asking for a refund.

I will never ever step my feet in their shop and will advise my children, friends and family members the same.
------------------------------------------------------
Your response is simply another approach to foolishness, borne out of the ignorance of trying hard without the application of ""common sense"". For your information, we don't buy from Argos because they are part of our families or because they are our friends. We buy because of ""Argos's"" unique value proposition and believe in the brand. What is that UVP? The right to return a product within 30 days, in alignment with the consumer legislation.

Whereas in situations where the right to return within 30 days, is absent, and, in situations where opened products cannot be returned, it is your duty to inform the buyer at POS and before any financial transaction crosses hands. If you were to inform me at the POS that If there was an issue with the product, I won't be able to return it or that if the product has been opened, you won't be taking it back, tell me any good reason why I should spend my money with Argos when I am well-informed regarding what consumer legislation says? Lastly, I will expect my receipt to say the same. What about ""privity of contract""? Does the receipt say; so? No! Common sense rules the world but it is not common.

You expected me to magically figure out that, you have instructions on your computers from your bosses and you do have a policy of not respecting the consumer legislation when someone buys a specific product or products, not so?.

Here is the worst part I have documented. The reason for refusing to refund my money was that; you wanted me to make contact with the manufacturer within what was supposed to be a cooling-off period. Secondly, because I pitched high whilst lamenting on the decision to keep my money. Here is the irony - 2 of your staff came to my face and said, ""we won't be spoken to like that"", thus floating their unfounded authority of ignorance, arrogance and stupidity.

It tells me, you don't even know the type of customers you may have coming through your doors. All customers, based on spend levels, come with a wide range of characteristic. Do not expect someone who spent ¬£450 on a faulty product to behave like someone who's just spent a ¬£3.00 on a pen.

Let's be clear here. The staff at Gallagher park has shared with the head office that, they refused to respect my refund because the packaging of the TV had tear and wear, hence the refusal. Really? Whereas, whilst in the shop, the primary reason was that, you have instructions on your computer not to accept the return of the product. Why do you have to dwell on lies and deception? Note that, trying to pervert the course of justice is not a laughing crime. I am certain your in-store cameras were rolling, so you may as well have to preserve them for evidence.",0

"The tl;dr version
---------------------

Traded in a phone (after a lengthy delay waiting for a trade-in bag), was told it was non-working and offered 1/6th of the original quote.

Asked for it to be returned and received no info on whereabouts of my device until it arrived through the letterbox with no signature required (and just ¬£100 insurance).

Got issue they deemed ""non-working"" fixed by carphone warehouse themselves in store free-of-charge (under warranty) in 10 minutes.

The delay in trade-in caused me to go over the cooling-off period for the new handset, and they won't do anything about it.

Basically, they seem like total scammers.

The long version
---------------------

I was looking to purchase a new mobile phone, so hunted around, and saw Carphone Warehouse were running a trade-in deal where you got an extra ¬£100 for selected models (in which my old phone was included), so decided to buy through them. I selected trade-in, filled in the relevant check-boxes stating it's condition (none of which mention ""screen burn"" I might add), and was offered a very competitive price (¬£180 + ¬£100 bonus), so went ahead with the order.

Upon ordering the new device, I got an email stating I would receive a trade-in bag within 3 working days, and then I could post it off, and be paid a few days later into my nominated bank account.

Well over a week later I received the trade in bag (I had to chase this up with customer support), which was very lightly padded, and only insured up to ¬£100 (they don't make this evident up front), so if you want to insure it for more, you have to pay special delivery yourself, at a cost of about ¬£7. So I wrapped my device in extra bubble wrap, paid special delivery, and posted it off.

About 5 days after they had signed for my old phone, I received an email saying my phone was ""non working"" due to ""screen burn"", and they would offer me just ¬£35 for it, and if they didn't hear back, they would just assume I'd accepted the offer?! I was pretty gobsmacked, and also annoyed that they'd used an email to inform me of this, and not called me or sent a text, as if that email had gone in the spam folder (maybe what they hoped would happen?), I would have lost my phone for a pittance.

I emailed them straight back asking them to return my phone, but received no confirmation, so I had to call customer support to make sure they received my email, and were returning my device to me.

After this it was a battle to find out any information from them at all. There is no way to contact the trade-in team directly, and I had to keep going to customer support, who then had to speak to trade-in and relay info (of which there wasn't any). After calling every day that week, I got a Royal Mail tracking number from customer support (still no response from trade-in), and 2 days later my phone was stuffed through my letter box. It had been sent tracked with no signature (insured for just ¬£100), in an unsealed envelope within a plastic bag. The sheer lack of care taken to return my device was staggering.

Upon inspecting my device, I saw what they'd rejected it for (tiniest bit of fade where the navigation bar is - I'd honestly not noticed it before), so decided to call Samsung, as it was less than 2 years old. They advised me to take it in to an approved service centre, which just happened to be Carphone Warehouse. Upon taking it in, the engineer said he could barely see the burn-in, but 10 minutes later, returned after a simple recalibration proceedure (all approved by Samsung apparently) and the burn-in was no longer visible. So basically that is exactly what the trade-in team could / would have done, yet reduced my trade-in price by ¬£145? So this leaves me to wonder how trustworthy the company and / or it's employees at the trade-in centre actually are?

And because they took so long with the trade-in process, I fell ouside of their 14 day cool off period to return my new handset, so they would not take it back for a refund. Their customer support even told me to speak to trading standards if I wasn't happy with their verdict. So I did, via the citizens advice consumer rights team.

They basically breached their own trade-in policy (which I have in writing) for not having the bag to me in 3 working days (hence causing me to fall outside their cooling off period), tried telling me my device was non working for something they ""fixed"" for free in 10 minutes, and their total lack of interest in helping me resolve the issue was abysmal.

And if you scroll through other reviews on here, you may find other people with exactly the same experience (trade-in rejected for screen burn, and offered a minimal amount of money). It just seems totally dishonest to me, and hopefully trading standards will look into their trade-in scheme.

I will personally never deal with them again, and would advise others to do their research before trading in their old device to this company.",0

"I bought 2 gift cards - one via an employee rewards program and one direct from their website. I have not been able to spend these gift cards - 4 orders all cancelled with no explanation. I didn't even get a cancellation email to inform me.

I have tried to resolve this via customer service - telephone, live chat, Facebook messenger chat, email - and no one could help. They kept blaming a technical issue, then later said my vouchers had been blocked for ""security reasons"". Currys are not part of any formal dispute resolution or ombudsman schemes, so I filed a complaint via Resolver. The customer service team told me that they wouldn't accept the vouchers online and that I should try going into a store and I might be able to spend them there. They could not guarantee the vouchers would be accepted. By this time, the item I wanted was out of stock.

No one from Currys seemed to see the problem with selling gift vouchers and then not accepting them for payment. I have spent hours trying to contact customer service and getting generic and unhelpful replies. It has caused a lot of stress and frustration.

In the end, I invoked my rights to cancellation under the Consumer Contracts law and I am now waiting confirmation of a refund. Thankfully I could do this as it was within 14 days of the purchase date - after that I'd have had no protection. If they don't provide a refund, I will have to take them to small claims court.

If you absolutely must shop at Currys, always pay by credit card so you can do a chargeback if anything goes wrong. And never buy a gift voucher - you could be left out of pocket like me and many others who have shared their stories online.",0

You can't even write your complaint yourself. Let alone it takes you in circles so you just give up and don't put the complaint at all.

"I have awarded one star simply because there's no option to give it zero. The most appalling experience of customer service I have ever encountered.

So Friday 15th Nov I succumbed to temptation as it's ""upgrade time"". I ordered a Samsung Galaxy A10 which was due to be delivered on Saturday 16th. DPD duly arrived with the new handset and so began my nightmare.......a nightmare from which I have yet to wake up!

First problem, the box was damaged and the seal on the box had been ripped open.
I rang the Carphone Warehouse call centre, where each person I spoke to had such dreadful English that I truly struggled to understand what was being said. I was on the phone for almost an hour!
Upshot was they agreed to collect the damaged goods the following day. The advisor also said it would be a direct exchange, where I give the damaged parcel to the DPD driver and he would hand me the replacement handset. I queried this as I had previously experienced a similar problem and had been told then that Carphone Warehouse do not offer this type of service.

The DPD driver was extremely confused, saying his instructions were simply to collect the damaged goods. No wonder!

Cue, my second call to Carphone Warehouse! Again, I genuinely struggled to understand the advisor's thickly-accented English. Finally I was told my new handset would arrive the following day. I had been put on hold for 50-odd minutes by this stage!

So, Tuesday 19th came and went, with no sign of the new handset. Although I did, rather bizarrely receive an email from Carphone Warehouse to say they had received the damaged item back at the Carphone Warehouse depot.
So my 3rd call to Carphone Warehouse call centre and again, the poor level of spoken English combined with the very thick accent meant I couldn't hear properly. However, I was told the damaged handset HAD NOT been received back as yet - a blatant lie! I requested to speak to the duty manager but the advisor actually ignored me. I made 5 further requests to speak with a manager and finally the advisor agreed to put me through. I had high hopes......until I heard the same thickly accented English. This manager told me the handset would arrive on Thursday. I queried this since it was already after noon on Wednesday. However she assured me it would be delivered on Thursday.

Needless to say, said handset did not turn up on Thursday. After yet another call, I was assured Friday would be ""the big day"". Another hour or so spent on a call to Carphone Warehouse.

Again, no handset and an outright liar on the phone! So this time, she told me that the previous, damaged parcel HAD NOT been delivered back to the warehouse!! I said I had an email proving that it had been delivered on Tuesday, but she simply repeated her lie! She refused to let me speak to the duty manager, so I said I would simply wait on the line until I had spoken to her manager. I assured her I had plenty of time (I hadn't!) and would be perfectly happy to wait on the line all day.

So in response to this she decided on a new plan - she has a sudden brainwave and tells me she will authorise me to go to the local store to collect a Samsung Galaxy A10. She had checked their stock or so she said. I absolutely double and triple checked this as I had previously been told that shop sales and telesales were two separate departments and I could not do this. However she said it would be fine as a one-off.

So I set off to the store, where I have to say, the two staff members were lovely. But they said firstly they were not authorised to hand over a phone to me. And secondly, they HAD NO STOCK of Samsung Galaxy A10s!!

Having wasted time and petrol, I got home and called the customer services again! Again, the total lack of communication skills prohibited much conversation. I was told my order and subsequent return was showing as ""open"" so they had no way of checking when my new handset would arrive. Then I told them just to cancel the whole order. At which point, I was informed I couldn't cancel an ""open order"". Err, pardon? You cannot tell me when my new handset will arrive but you also say I cannot cancel the order???

In desperation I called my network which is O2, because they've already put me on the new tarrif and yet I have no phone.

O2 have experienced the same problems as I have but are trying to help.

Which is more than can be said about Carphone Warehouse, whose call centre staff clearly do not value their jobs and come across as rude, disinterested and uncaring.

Easily my worst ever experience.


Update on Monday 25th November: on my first call to Carphone Warehouse call centre the girl I spoke to kept putting me on hold. After 50 minutes on hold, I finally said ""no, this call is costing me money"" - to which she immediately replied ""no, don't worry about it. All calls to Carphone Warehouse customer service are free "". Imagine my horror this morning when I discovered that all the hours spent trying to get help has cost me ¬£97!!! I'm actually in tears and feeling sick at this amount which, as a struggling widow, I cannot afford. Never will I go anywhere near Carphone Warehouse again.",0
"We are still locked in a battle after 6 weeks with the lack of customer services at BT. Our account was overcharged by thousands due to someone making a huge error and adding a chain of hotels to our phone line account. I have spent hours on the phone and sent numerous emails in an effort to get a refund arranged, which have been passed from one department to the other with no update. Even our account manager won't return an email... What hope do we have? Worse still, this error breached the rules of Direct Debit which states that a customer should receive 10 days notification of any change. Incredibly frustrating.",0
"Paid ¬£200 in Bark credits. Messaged 30 people with my services. (I get plenty of custom from Google) my only responses were;

First response: I only want to work with women (totally fair but Bark should not be showing me these leads as a male - I had set my preferences for this)
- Second: Please stop sending me these messages (clearly getting spammed) as I only sent one very short polite intro

I hardly write reviews but in this instance I felt compelled. I don‚Äôt know where these ‚Äòleads‚Äô are coming from but they were absolutely no value to me.

When I contacted Bark for a refund of credits for the ‚Äòlead‚Äô that only wanted a female they refused. Pretty poor service to be honest and I would certainly explore other areas of marketing/lead generation for your business.

*My business has only five star reviews on Google so am very surprised with that conversion rate. Not one customer from the whole investment. Questionable‚Ä¶",0

"I will NEVER use Deliveroo again.

Why is it so stressful just to alter a small mistake on an order??

It can't be changed on the app even if the restaurant agrees it should be changed... The restaurant is unable to change it... And when you try to get it sorted through customer service it is a NIGHTMARE. They will say that they are unable to amend anything and cannot help.

Took a ridiculous amount of time between two agents just to get a small item ordered in duplicate refunded.

After an unnecessarily long phone call, the agent had spoken to the restaurant and told me that the restaurant would refund me. I phoned the restaurant to check who said that the agent told them that Deliveroo would refund me...

Given the different stories given by the agent, I phoned another agent to check on this. He couldn't have sounded less bothered, wouldn't listen properly and said ""well the restaurant can say what they want but we can't change anything.""

In a strop he reluctantly phoned the restaurant to confirm and then told me I would get a refund... Whether it happens is to be seen.

This is really bad.

I'll be using Uber Eats from now on. Hope they are a little bit better.",0

"Purchased a coffee machine as a Christmas gift 26th November. Wasn‚Äôt suitable so tried to return to store on 27th December was told as it was an online order I had to return via online form. Tried to do this on 2nd January and was denied due to 3 week return policy ( don‚Äôt buy Christmas presents from curry‚Äôs unless your a last minute shopper because you won‚Äôt be able to return it) spoke to web chat on 4th January and collection of item arranged for 5th January, item was not collected but shown as collected on courier website tracking. Gave it time to update, no change. Contacted web chat and telephone customer services various times to be told various different things. Eventually another collection arranged for 25th January, dpd updated tracking information as item was not ready to collect despite not turning up at all. Contacted customer services again to be told I‚Äôm out the 30 day period now, can‚Äôt return, despite this not being my fault! Then requested to drop of to dpd collection point, was told I would receive confirmation within. 24 hours, low and behold no communication at all! So here I am again, on the phone to customer services and again being told I‚Äôm out of the 30 day return period (which also changes regularly) shocking customer service.

"I ordered a washing machine from Currys with installation and recycling of old machine via Team Knowhow at an additional charge.

When the engineers arrived, I was told they would be unable to install or remove the old washing machine as there was a fault with the water valve / pipe, and that I would need to get a plumber to fix it. I didn't question this at the time.

Once I paid the plumber his ¬£40 call out charge, he verified that, in fact, there was nothing wrong with the pipe or valve and that the Team Knowhow engineer had lied to me, in order to avoid having to carry the washing machine up the stairs to my apartment. So I am ¬£40 out of pocket thanks to this dreadful service, and a month delayed in getting my new washing machine. (In fairness Team Knowhow have agreed to refund me the plumbers call out fee, but I've yet to receive this.)

So buyer beware, Currys may advertise some very attractive prices but their support and after sales service via Team Knowhow is shockingly poor.",0

We have still been contracted with BT in this time and will be expecting adequate compensation. We have been incredibly displeased with the service offered.",0

"I would give zero if I could - Avoid at all costs any kind of online purchase!
How should I even start this review? It has been one week of a complete nightmare dealing with them... Let's start then:
1. I bought a Samsung s10 online on sunday. There was an issue with the bank and the payment was declined so I purchased again....
2. They then issued two orders - meaning 2000 pounds was removed from my bank
3. On Monday I called them to cancel one of the orders - The agent told me I could not cancel it, I had to wait for the order to be delivered to then return it
4. From the tracking of the orders, both were returned to consigner and no explanation was given - no email the orders had been cancelled or any communication at all
5. On wednesday, I called again, they told me that the orders had been cancelled for reasons they could not give and that the refund would be issued in 3-5 days
6. on Friday I received two letters regarding the insurance - I found it weird since they had been cancelled
7. Today I contacted the CS who told me refunds had not been issued without any explanation at all - They now told me the refund would be issued but I requested a print of the conversation as they are the least reliable service ever

Now with 2000 pounds less in my account, it's been one week of a complete nightmare as they are not clear at all, do not establish any type of communication and we have to chase them down to a terrible Customer Service who basically tell you what you want to hear but do nothing about it. I will never buy anything from them and I advice anyone that sees my review to do the same unless they want to have empty conversations with agents that barely speak english.",0

Finally got this chased up and had an email sent to me at 3.40 saying they wanted to lower the offer by ¬£55 to ¬£300!!! Luckily I had taken pictures of the device before I sent it which shows no scratches like they are stating and I‚Äôve escalated this to a manager in Mazuma and am awaiting a response. Being told I probably won‚Äôt receive their pictures of the apparent damage until Monday which will then the payment I should have received today! Avoid this company at all costs, they‚Äôre just out to rip people off, but then try and sell phones they say are damaged at top whack on their website!!!",0
"It is a shame that one star is the lowest I can give. I have had the worst customer service experience of my life with BT Broadband.

"DO NOT get BT's Digital Voice service unless you are in a FTTP (fibre to the property) service area. I have VDSL aka copper to the house aka what most people in the country still have. The line quality was so poor that the line is rendered unusable.

I was explicitly told before registering that I would be able to downgrade from this if the service quality wasn't good enough, because I had questioned it since it's a digital service still being provided over copper.

After my broadband was activated and I found the service quality on the line was garbage, I got in contact with BT multiple times to only be told that I won't ever be able to change back to a normal phone line with BT because quote ""the hardware has been changed in the exchange"".

Thing is, I know that's not true, because I have a Virtual PBX for my business phone. I know for a fact that no-one changed anything at the exchange as my phone was assigned a VOIP telephone number as part of Digital Voice, something that is done by a server not by physically changing anything at the exchange (number after the area code starts '34', this is VOIP. Normal physical lines are '77' in my area, regardless of how many numbers are allocated because they're still available with other suppliers!)

I'm now in a position where I can't back out of my contract as it's part of the government's cheaper broadband for UC recipients, and will never be able to get my damn phone line back. I've been entirely misinformed all the way along. I *need* my landline and you've taken that from me.",0
"I had no internet for a few hours tonight. I called TT and had an automated message telling me they have a limited team to help with enquiries and to contact them online.

There was no telling me how many people were before me in the queue - they just kept me hanging. Internet now back on but I prefer good customer service and am willing to pay extra for it.

In response to their reply: Oh don't worry, it's done. I've had nothing but problems with you. You make me sick and I'm relieved. Do your research guys and just Google best customer service for broadband.",0

Furthermore their website is full of bugs and the welcome offer of 3 months free for new customers is apparently falsely advertised. Let me leave a paper trail on here as well that I will be canceling my switch with you within my allowed 14 day cooling off period and the direct debit has been already cancelled with you as well.

If I could give 0 stars it would still be too many. Bought a TV from local store. Took it home and opened the box to find a crack in the screen. Returned it to same store within hours of purchasing it and they refused to refund or replace it and accused us of damaging it ourselves as the box wasn't damaged. Asked to speak to a manager but none available. They refused to budge and said if unhappy with their decision to call customer services. Tried that and been on hold 2 and a half hours now! The item was damaged when purchased and is unusable so we are ¬£300 down and can't speak to anyone. Appalling customer service and attitude. Never buying from there again.,0

I begrudge giving them 1 star
UPDATE
After patiently waiting for 2 months for my phone and receiving numerous false promises I told them I was thinking of contacting my bank for help, I received a reply the same day saying that because of this they had cancelled my order and I would have a refund in 14 days. Guess what, no refund. They then said it would be 21st May. I have now raised a dispute with my bank who said they would keep me updated with progress every few days.

"I have used BT broadband for years and it has always been fine, solid connection and decent speeds. My problem has come recently when trying to cancel my service as I was out of contract.

I called in March to cancel and told yes will be cancelled at the end of the month and obviously I would have to pay the amount I owe - no problem.
A couple of weeks ago I receive a bill from BT. I look into my bank account and find that they have been charging me every month (my bad I guess for not cancelling the direct debit or checking my account regularly but its not my main account).

I called up and got through to someone who was very helpful and knew that I had called up to cancel previously and that it hadn't been processed. She immediately cancelled and then put me on hold whilst she went to her manager to process the refund.

After 10 minutes on hold I was transferred to someone else who had no idea why I had been transferred to them and they couldn't see anything about when I had cancelled or any bills that had been sent. I was told that there was a recording of my phone call to cancel from March on the records and that a Supervisor would listen to that and I would be called back by the same person in 7 days between 10am-12pm.

Come that day the time passes - finally I was called at 6pm and told that they couldn't verify that I had cancelled. If they had looked into data used they would see none had been used for 4 months.

This all seems quite suspicious, I wish the first person I had spoken to had stuck with it.

Turns out BT are happy to take your money but not so happy to refund it.

Please don't tell me to contact you through Facebook or Twitter as I have neither. Give me the details of someone I can speak to to get this resolved.

"I was a talk talk customer for over 15years! Always paid my bills on time. My contract ended at the same time I moved home & I decided to go to a different phone/broadband company. Talk talk asked me to return their equipment 1) router 2) talk talk tv box which was almost prehistoric in age... it took 4 phonecalls to ask why they had not sent the packaging for me to do this as they stated when I closed my account (really useful during a home move!) Eventually I received packaging and promptly returned equipment (luckily I had learned by now not to trust talk talk so I thankfully kept the original tracking receipt) I posted in September 2022, since then I have recieved bills each month for the equipment totalling ¬£100 I called every month and spoke to numerous different customer service reps who promised me this bill would be removed as I had sent everything back and supplied the receipt for this. It is now Jan 2023 and again a bill arrived for ¬£100 so I raised a complaint. 2 hours after my complaint was received I got another email from moorcroft debt agents as talk talk had now sold my debt! (That doesn't actually exist) moorcroft have put this on hold to investigate however today I called talk talk customer service again to get some feedback on my complaint and was just told it would take 72 hours for them to receive my email! Whaaaat?
On this call (was super hoping to never hear that talk talk music ever again) I spent another 40minutes explaining to the advisor who kept putting me on hold to confer with a manager who was hiding behind their agent and wouldn't speak to me directly. Shocking.....
I work myself in customer care and I would never handle a complaint in this manner especially after hearing the stress it is placing on me.
I believe it is time to seek some professional advice as it is now borderline harrasment.

I got an assignment to fulfil so I did. I can already say that this assignment it takes over 30 minutes won't be surprised if it will take an hour to complete. Already after finishing this I got an E-mail and it says 'We've reviewed your application and on this occasion decided that we won't be pursuing your application any further.'

"I feel absolutely ripped off from them.
I bought a refurbished phone from them over a month ago which still has not been delivered. Once you order from them, they tell you that they will send a postal tracking number to notify you that your phone is out for delivery. I'm still waiting on that email and tracking number which I assume I will never get.
I emailed their customer contact after a month after purchase and all they came back with was a weak apology plus a vague response that my order will be despatched as quickly as possible. Its been a week and a half since they responded and still no sign of a tracking number. They claim that my order is being processed as quickly as possible and that its taking ""longer than normal"" because of the pandemic. They never specified how long that ""long time"" meant or how far up I was on the list of the orders that ""are being dispatched as quickly as possible"".
I understand that the issues of staffing and orders getting out are because of the current pandemic but, do not promise your customers that you'll process your order within 10 days and then when you don't hit the mark, not specify how long it will actually take.
Also the fact that they only issue refunds within 14 days of purchase is pretty unheard of... its usually up to 30 days and I'm pretty certain that I won't be getting a refund because they'll turn around to me and claim that I've been way over the 14 day mark. I've sent them another email asking for a refund but I don't think I'll be seeing my money back.
Don't let them take your money, go somewhere more reputable like envirofone, CEX or even ebay.",0
"Ordered on 24th Nov and 11 days later, still hasn't been delivered. No idea where it is or if/when it will arrive. Ordered the same thing on Amazon on 1st Dec after getting sick of waiting and it arrived with guaranteed Prime delivery the next day. First and last time I use CEX for online delivery.",0
DON‚ÄôT USE THIS COMPANY This company took my money on 14 February but never sent my phone. Eventually I got fed up waiting and cancelled my order but am still waiting for a refund 2 months later! The customer service is appalling and no one cares ! I have now reported them to my card issuer and will claim for interest on the funds they have kept.,0
"I was misadvised about the entire process from the start.
Had my phone sitting in store for 2 weeks before sending it off because they ""forgot"", Currys had my phone for a whole month only to just give me a replacement anyway. No apologies from them. The list goes on.. AVOID!",0
Still TRYING to collect money so they will keep getting one star! Neither have they responded to my email response for my complaint!,0
Sent a secondary order created by an technical expert to the wrong address which was confirmed by evri and photo taken of delivery just say this was not done which is a lie,0
Totally agree marks electrical didn't turn up today,0
Possibly the worst provider I've had the misfortune of encountering. Endless times I was unable to log in to my account error message popped up saying please try later. Cancelled the service yet 7 months on was still being charged. Wouldn't of minded so much had I had been able to view anything but no yet again error message after error message. As for Customer Services good luck with that more chance of locating Madeline McCann than a CS rep. In the end I called my bank and told them to block Now TV. Would never sign up again nor would I encourage friends to. If you dislike someone drop into conversation how amazing it is - just for kicks. Would rather gauge out my eyeballs than deal with this company again.,0
"After more then 1 month I've sent back a spares coming damaged I'm still wait the refund, buyspares try to find any excuse but I'm tracked the delivery and I know them received that. Buyspares had call me and said all is fine will refund me but still didn't, I'll continue to give everywhere negative feedback to don't leave more people do my same mistake, don't buy from buyspares have not a telephone number ( maybe to many complaints) customer service don't help with your problems no answer to the mails always and ignore you after sent back the part if you ask a refund. Never ever will use again buyspares",0
"been with three for about 8-10 years... it has gone down hill very fast.
still getting 3g in areas, its being switched off in a year or so. very worrying and my last renewal was a pack of lies, said the phone was dispatched , then it was not, then it was delayed for a month or so...
always ring me up once a week to try persuade me to take out another contract for family member etc...
bill has gone from 70 to 89 a month! contract ends in 24 days and i wont be using these clowns again.",0
"Oh the joys,

Moved from London and had my WI Fi with HYPEROPTIC and they were amazing and efficient, one day and had WI Fi,

Now in Torquay, no option but had to go with BT, it‚Äôs like being in the 60‚Äôs, was told on the phone that it would take 2 days for router etc etc, now just found out I have to wait 3 weeks ??

Talk about living in the dark ages,

Really not impressed,,

Saying that after reading all these reviews, it seems I‚Äôm not alone,

BT need to get into the 21st Century,,

Or end up like Marks and Spencer‚Äôs, on there way out,

Actually called again and it was pointless so it was just easier to cancel .

BT as mentioned stuck in a time warp , plus holding people to 24 months contract another good reason not to go with them . Lesson learned .. never again",0
"Awful for environment and communication. We‚Äôve got an old internet equipment set which we‚Äôve requested to send back to BT 5 times. They offer to send you a bag to collect it so you can send it to the right place for recycling. We‚Äôve spent hours on the phone to them just asking for this bag so we can recycle this equipment, because if every customer chucked it out the landfill damage would be huge. Each time they say ‚Äúyes of course we will send it this week sorry‚Äù. It has never come. They have made it impossible to recycle and we are going to have to give up. Really disappointing and irresponsible environmentally never mind regarding customer service.",0
"Such poor service, probably one of the worst customer service experience I have received. Took 45 minutes to get through, finally spoke to 3 different people who eventually ordered new phones and confirmed they would arrive last Wednesday, but have still yet to arrive.

"I ordered an intergrated undercounter freezer.
Full instructions were put on the order by staff in shop. I assured the fitters would be capable of this task.
Unfortunately this was no the case they only arrived with a screw driver and stated they had no idea how to install the freezer. I tied to seek help but had to return to the shop no other way of contacting them. Very disappointed",0
"Booked appointment the engineer didn't turn up,phoned D&G got told they sub contracted the work out to another company so phone them.",0
"I left BT when I moved in February, the only reason we left was because they were unable to provide a decent internet speed to our new address. We returned our equipment when we moved and despite receiving an email and text on 7th April confirming that they'd received it, they continued to regularly chase me to return it and soon said that I owed them over ¬£200 for the equipment that I hadn't supposedly returned. I've spoken to them on live chat various times and also on the phone on 19th April, 8th May, 22nd May and 19th June. Each time the person that I have spoken to has assured me that I have no balance outstanding on my account, the equipment has been received and I'll receive no further contact asking for the equipment. The last time I spoke to them I was particularly annoyed as I was being threatened with debt collectors. After speaking to them on 19th June I'd hoped that would be the last of it. Today I have received a letter from their debt collector. To say I'm angry is an understatement. I cannot believe the absolute incompetence from one of the largest internet and phone providers in this country. I would advise anyone against going with BT, a work colleague of mine is also having the exact same issue with them. I'm sick of having to contact them because they're unable to carry out a simple task!",0
"I‚Äôve been with this company for about six years now, they decided to change my contract, which k wasn‚Äôt happy with and made no attempt to help out. On top of that, once my contract was over, and I‚Äôd paid everything I started getting stalked with phone calls and finally got a piece of paper saying I owe them money. NO FINAL BILL, or listing of what these charges are, just a ‚Äúyou owe us this much‚Äù. When I phoned to resolve this issue, I spoke to a guy called Nikhil who was extremely rude and kept talking on top of me. He asked for my memorable name or place, and because I gave him the right one third time round, he refused to help me, telling me I only had two attempts! Despite the fact that I did give him the correct name! I cannot even believe how terrible this company has become since joining them. Just stay well away from them, disgusting customer services, charges that are ridiculous and unjustified and no appreciation for loyal customers.
Edit to reply to the bellow email comment: I was informed of changes to my I tract and was given no other option but to either accept that (more expensive), or go with another contract (more expensive). I have the correct reply to the security question when I said two words together, if you want to split peas, I actually said the correct answer second (you can check phone recording of the convo), you relying that you ever do this and never do that - or invalidating my experience with Three is ridiculous and not gaining you any brownie points. I‚Äôm out of here!",0
How can ur broadband be so fu ck *n sh* t it‚Äôs actually unbelievable. Everyday day it‚Äôs cuts out at least 3 times and that‚Äôs on a good day. Cant wait till September when I can finally get rid of this piece of sh* t broadband,0
"Hi

I have sent many messages to this number 0753 305 1809and also i tried to cancel my contract through your contract department ,they did cut me off.

You trying to keep me but there is no contract between us and virgin media from the end of this month, I am sure you have received our letter for the cancellation as well.I have sent all the details to number which you recommended too.",0
We have been with Talk Talk for over 15 years but the costs for broadband package we‚Äôre getting expensive so we decided to switch to NOW TV Broadband. Worst decision I have ever made. Yes it is cheap but it just keeps dropping out and this time it‚Äôs been off since before noon and it‚Äôs after 8pm and it‚Äôs still not back on. It‚Äôs not worth 20p a month never mind ¬£20. I can‚Äôt wait to cancel it and they can whistle for anymore money as I will close my bank account to make sure they don‚Äôt get a penny more off me.,0
My game didn‚Äôt come it‚Äôs a scam never buy anything from this website,0
"All went wrong. New piece of rubish equipment which is not working, then bunch of useless pakees (I rang them 5 times) trying making me feel like a stupid goat, explaining me how to connect 3 cables and if this isn't enough already, they can send an engineer soonest in 10 days, leaving me and my family (kids can't contact grandmas abroad) without internet and without working landline for xmas. This is a f**king joke",0
"Expensive, if you have troubles with your broadband they will charge you regardless of fault. Considering the router belongs to bt they only won‚Äôt charge for issues outside the building. They presume you tamper with it and even if breaks down will charge you. Be careful! They are a big company for a reason‚Ä¶ scamming customers. Ring up got cut off three times and spoke to five people trying to sort one issue. They all say will call you back and don‚Äôt!",0
"If I could rate this lower than 1 star I would go for minus. Carphone warehouse have now had my phone for over two weeks and it‚Äôs been a week since I requested it be returned to me. This definitely feels like a scam and I am worried they are stealing my iPhone from me. No sign yet of them sending it back despite me contacting them via Twitter, Facebook, email and on here. The only place I‚Äôve even received a response is Facebook messenger. Emails must not be monitored end ‚Äúescalation‚Äù is a load of rubbish as you get no reply on there either. I have reported them to trading standards and asked multiple times for their formal complaints procedure and I have yet to receive anything. I think they are stealing peoples trade in phones and not paying them or trying to dupe them in to a massively reduced amount which is the scam. The media needs to focus some attention on these criminals and action needs to take place",0
"This company are so bad they take your money, then when your dryer sets on fire they take weeks to get an engineer out. Do not buy their insurance product as its not worth the paper it's written on. Also spent hours on the phone trying to resolve without success. Still no dryer or engineer.",0

"I've been with Virgin for donkey years....always been more than happy with their service and package. UNTIL NOW. I've been sent letters and email telling me that on 5th December my service will be disconnected unless I fit the adaptor they have sent me. I contacted them to tell them that I have not received it. I was put through to someone who spoke very bad broken English and I really had a job understanding them When I asked if I could be put through to someone who could speak better English, I was told that this was impossible. I hung up the phone and got another person who spoke poor English which I had trouble understanding I again asked if I could speak to someone who spoke better English and was told 'that is not possible'. I told the person on the phone that I will be going into my bank to cancel my direct debit as I was not going to pay for a service which I do not have. I have tonight spent the last couple of hours trying to find another provider who will give me the service which Virgin Media should be doing. I understand that they can pay pennies to operate their phone call centre in poor country where they can pay pennies to phone operators but I don't not think that Virgin Customers should have to pay the price for that by having a poor customer service due to trying to understand what the operators are trying to say.......oh and if anyone reading this feels this is a racial thing....I can assure you I'm not and have no time for racists.",0
"If I could give 0 for customer service , I would. Every 18 months it is a nightmare trying to get a ""good""deal, loyalty is useless. The customer service staff are very polite, yet often do not understand the problem, or accents are confusing, or the phone drops out during the call and no call back, or the wrong information is given by inexperienced? staff, or nothing happens re bills and ""we will sort the error in your bill next month"" and on and on. The staff try there best, yet on too many occasions are ineffective, leading to many hours of repetition on the 150 line, for the same problem, and worse of all, the mental stress, on occasions leading to my anger/ and almost tears. This should not be.
I dread now, in anticipation of renewing my contract in 9 months. A great product, and an appalling Customer Service. Is there a better service out there?
Since writing the above I have had a response from Virgin, typical of their customer care, an all encompassing, off the shelf, ""cut and paste"" reply. It would have been nice
to have had an effective chat re my concerns, however that is beyond VMs remit as they ignore their customers, by having a captive audience. I am not surprised by their very poor customer ratings. Such a pity.",0

"I tried to book in their broadband with them and somehow the person on the phone to me got EVERYTHING wrong. The delivery address I gave them, the date it would start (so I would incur a fee from my previous supplier), and we were told we had to be in for the router delivery a couple of days later and then it turned out they wouldn't deliver it for another month so it was a complete waste staying in. I don't understand how they could get everything so wrong. Whether they were either stupid or trying to make people's life hard deliberately. I cancelled in the end because how can you trust a company like that, it would be just endless problems.",0

"Shocking! It amazes me how Currys PCWorld / Team Knowhow get away with it. I have been waiting for a partial refund since January after they delivered a damaged fridge-freezer. This is on top of previous failed deliveries dating back to August 2020!
I expect I'll get some bland reply to this review saying something like, ""Sorry to hear this, blah, blah, blah....Hope it's been resolved, blah, blah, blah,.... Get in touch if you need further support, blah, blah, blah,....""
But that's the point - You eventually get in touch after hours on the phone and days waiting for the social media team to reply to your DMs and nothing happens:
- Out of UK call centres with ridiculous menu options and staff who say they can't help and then cut you off!
- Social media team that appear well-meaning but are totally ineffective, ending up, ""escalating this issue for you.""
- Emails sent via the Resolver website that are ignored and go unanswered.
So, Currys PCWorld / Team KnowHow it's over to you. You can either hit your keyboard shortcuts:
F1 - We apologise for the delay.
F2 - You'll receive your refund within 3 - 5 days.
F3 - I've escalated this issue to our customer services team.
F4 - Due to the Coronavirus we are experiencing higher than usual demand.

"I can not convey how bad my latest experience has been . I recently moved and trying to contact Vodafone is simply breathtaking‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.ly bad .
As I‚Äôm writing this I‚Äôm on hold , I‚Äôve been pushed from Tobi the automated idiot in to other folk online who take on average 5mins per sentence or reply . If I told you I‚Äôm now entering the 3rd hour of trying to move and that is just this call !
Numerous other attempts have ended in failure so this is just another attempt
I do not think I will be alive by the time it is sorted out . I‚Äôm 60 now and I feel like I‚Äôm on my last legs .
Obviously I had to use my mobile as trying to change my broadband and telephone has resulted in me not having a phone or internet and when I started my call my mobile had 95% I‚Äôm now down to 25% and no end is insight
If anyone is reading this and I don‚Äôt survive the wait please somebody let my family know I did my best and tried till the bitter end .
How hard is it ? Why didn‚Äôt I just cancel and take the hit and start again with another provider .
Why have I made the wrong choices in life and Vodafone I‚Äôd say is one of them

Update
After 3hrs on the phone yesterday they still buggered it up ,
Another 3hrs today online with Vodafone it looks like it might be sorted but seeing as this has been going on since September the 10th 2022 I will hold on and try to believe that it will be right now but who knows
I had to go with these as I am still paying for a phone in a house that I no longer live at so the worry is unbelievable . I have reluctantly had to take out another 2 yr contract to avoid fees but I seriously doubt I will go back when this contract ends and I can not recommend Vodafone to any one .

"* An Openreach engineer attended premises where my flat is and removed my broadband connection or FTTC connection on Friday 9th April resulting in no service for my connection. 
* I booked an engineer for the fault at my property for Monday 12th April  (Name of engineer was Bilhal)‚Äì who informed me of the situation outlined in point 1. He then proceeded to leave after 20 mins, and was overheard on the phone saying, ‚Äúhe did not know what the fault was‚Äù and then informed me to order a new hub.
* A new hub arrived and surprise, surprise, there is still a fault. Another 45 min call with customer service to book a new engineer on 15th April. 
* 15/04: after clearing my schedule for the appointment, I log onto bt.com to be informed that the engineer visit is ""complete"" with an added green tick - as if everything is resolved. No communication to me, not even an attempt at an apology.
* Cue then another hour conversation with your customer service to be told that the appointment was moved, and no-one can attend until Monday 19th April, and that ""hands are tied"". 
* 16/04: Called again to see if anything can be done for an earlier appointment - told yes, we can get engineer to you on 17/04. It‚Äôs all confirmed and booked
* 17/04 - no engineer. No contact and again only discovered when logging onto bt.com. The customer service rep admitted that engineers are not bothering to turn up to appointments and marking them as completed visits. Gaslighted me when I told him I‚Äôve never had this issue with Sky / inferring that I‚Äôm making it all up and finally, to top it all off, threw his colleague under bus by saying that my appointment for 17/04 was never confirmed. At this point, don‚Äôt know whether to laugh or cry. Also, that I should just complain to the ombudsman
* 19/04 - another missed engineer who at 8.03am said he visited the property and fixed the fault. Another 1 hour and 15 min call to be told that someone did attend. Now they have to book another engineer. But this time, it‚Äôs a manual process. She has to email someone to book it and they are going to call me to arrange an appointment.

It‚Äôs now 10 days of no broadband and clearly they just expect me to accept this.

I‚Äôve emailed the CEOs of both BT and Openreach and neither of them take any responsibility.

The worst part is they sent me a ¬£30.05 compensation as if that would smooth everything over. What a joke.",0

"Complete scam.
My grandfather bought me a care plan with Team Knowhow in 2015 after being pressured to do so as they were saying it was essential in case the laptop ever needs to be repaired. Only recently we found that that this wasn't the case, the plan only backs up for files and doesn't cover any repairs. Around 2016 the laptop became unlinked to the account which made us forget about it. It was only when my grandfather noticed a payment of ¬£60 being taken out of his bank account a few months ago that we remembered about the care plan.
We tried multiple times to get the plan cancelled. We tried doing it online only to be told that they didn't have all the information to follow through with the request even though I put down everything the form asked for. We tried calling only to be told that another number does cancellations or that they need my permission, when I wasn't there, to cancel as it was my details on the account even though it was his card. My grandfather even tried to write to them but didn't receive a respond. It was only after my boyfriend got involved were we able to cancel the plan after weeks of trying.

I was offered an insulting ¬£157.00, for a TV that was purchased for ¬£700. I complained to the repair person who advised me of this and he would not log a complaint for me.

"We have signed a 24-month contract with BT, probably the most expensive broadband provider among all others.

As part of the contract, BT provided us a ¬£90 credit reward card so that the price difference didn't look so big.

After receiving the card, we seldom use it until recently it cannot work and then we realized there is a only 12-month validity period.

We called their customer service 3 weeks ago and their staff promised to send us a replacement card.

Until today we still haven't received it so we called their customer service again.

Their staff advised us to call the card issuer.

The card issuer said they cannot provide the replacement card without BT's instruction.

We called their customer service again and their people cannot help and mentioned it's company policy.

It is totally unacceptable as the broadband contract is 24 months, we don't expect them to send us a reward card that is valid only for 12 months.

On the other hand, there is a Master Card sign on the reward card, we won't expect a Master Card to expire for only 12 months. There is no warning message through any of the communication that the validity of the card is only for a year neither.

We contacted them back and forth and then just taking a circle without solving the issue.

Conclusion:
Probably the most expensive broadband provider with the worst service! BT does not hesitate to take any advantage from their customers. No wonder they can make such a huge profit!!!",0
"Placed an order on the 23rd of march for new broadband and it got cancelled with no notice given to me. I already cancelled my SKY broadband and was due to get full fibre on the 11th of April but I didn't so had to wait till the 26th of April by placing a new order but phoned up today about logging in just to be told it's been cancelled AGAIN extremely frustrated as my family are now on day 6 with no internet and need to hotspot everything and that won't last much longer. Phone staff have no idea what they are talking about, chat is just boys that copy and paste everything and don't understand a word you say. Wish I never left sky and probably won't be going for anything Vodafone ever again AVOID THIS COMPANY PLEASE",0
"So the only info I've got on what they are doing with my TV is text messages, no reference number or job number no name or email address a guy took my TV last week and said I'd have it back within 7 business days, I have no clue where my TV is or who has it or what happening with it.

I want answers ASAP, the driver and van is on cctv x what's happening",0
"Goods never turned up when stated,had to wait a week for a refund and only received the refund today after several phone calls. Will never use you again",0
"I eventually received a reply at 16:20, the new information is:

""I can confirm that your TV was sent to our write-off team for assessment on August 19th. However, due to working through a backlog of cases, we advise that it may take up to 14 days for this assessment to be completed, though it will likely be sooner.""

I have emailed the details requested at 12:34 on 23rd August, I will update this post when I receive a response

I put an item in for repair on 11 August, after a week of checking on their tracking system the item still had not made it to the repair centre which is only 20 miles away, several phone cals later the system was updated that it arrived, the message then changed to contact them, which I have done everyday since (bear in mind the return date was 18th august) I can get no further other than being told the item is with the write off team,with each call I'm told to wait another couple of days and phone again if I do not hear, I would not complain but all through this I have an 8 year old ear bashing me about getting his TV back, before anyone says anything I do tell him that he did break it so he has to be patient, but surely I should get a definitive answer rather than be moved on for another 2 days each time I call",0

"I sent my iphone 11 to sell to music magpie at an agreed price of ¬£220. I have just had an email that they have received the iphone 11 have given me a revised price from ¬£220 to ¬£140 as it has been over 21 days. 

That is absolutely disgraceful and unacceptable. The item was posted on the 27/12/2022. Royal mail have said that they delivered the item on the 11/01/2023. In my opinion music magpie have deliberately held on to the item until the 21 days have expired to give a much lower price than first offered. This is absolutely shocking behavior. To make things even worse is that mazuma mobile is offering ¬£190. Thats ¬£50 more than music magpies revised price. My advice is to stay away from this company.",0
"Trade in offer looked good! Trade in your old Samsung device for any new Samsung device and recieve a ¬£250 bonus!

So we did just that!
Followed all the instructions to the letter, selected collect from our nearest store as it makes transfering data and trade in so much easier.

A few days later recieved message informing us that new mobile was on its way....to our home address! Ok not what we wanted or asked for but its not a big deal or so we thought!

New phone arrived so we transfered data then took old phone to nearest shop to complete trade in.
Shop was useless! They actually sent us to another shop because they didn't know what to do!
2nd shop was no better but they got there in the end.

Shop knew nothing about ¬£250 bonus but after a couple of calls they told us it would be paid to us within 30 days.

Called carphone warehouse/currys customer service next day just to make sure and was told the same, that it would take up to 30 days for bonus payment to be paid out.

Waited for 30 days and no sign of bonus so we called again only this time we were informed they hadn't a clue what we were on about they didn't know anything about bonus!

Once we explained everything we were informed it would be sent to medics to look into, they promised to call back within 5 days with an update.

Another month passes so we called back again and went through all the same information, this time we were informed that issue was that shop put trade in as new deal, this meant new and old devices were seen as seperate contracts so it would be sorted.
Roll on another month and still nothing, called again! Went through everything again and was informed it would be sent to medics again!
Another month passes and we call again, have to go through all the information about what happened again.

Was informed that our bonus claim that was advertised had been rejected based on the fact even though we requested new device to be sent to nearest shop and they had sent it to our home, because we took took old device to shop to trade in as we had said we wanted we should have sent it back in the post even though that wasnt what we asked for.
I have to wonder if they sent new device to our home address deliberately know it would invalidate the bonus payment?

Customer service agent was reading aloud history of complaint...their last words before call was disconnected was.....customer was mislead by ......

No doubt usual reply to contact on socials but given the fact after 4 phone calls over 4 months and hearing customer services last words and it was still rejected talking is not going to help.

Have been loyal to Carphone Warehouse for many years with 2 devices, this renewal will be the last.

Company is a complete joke

And no i will NOT reach out again!
Read above i will never use you again",0
"I have never been a a customer of Vodafone, yet keep on being contacted by debt collection agencies about contracts that people with the same name have seemingly taken out with them. Why do Vodafone allow this harassment to happen in their name?

Vodaphone, can you please contact Lowell and tell them to stop harassing everyone with the same name they can find - it's very intrusive to the point of harassment and every time I move house they contact me again about someone else's historic Vodaphone debt. It takes several letters to get them to back off. Please respond here to say you have dealt with this (Lowell reference number L5ADRDEF) so that others can see you care about this kind of shady practice in your name (e.g. I'd prefer not to get an auto-response asking me to get in touch - it's enough hassle already.

Failed to turn up after first phone call,three weeks later promised they were in the post.agsin nothing turned up. Phoned up third time and told they were out for delivery still haven't turned up.

"I'm almost relieved to see the appalling reviews that other customers have left about NOW TV.
In a nutshell, charged ¬£5.99 for 12+ months for a pass that I could neither view, nor manage from my account.
Try to get hold of them? Go on, see how long it takes you to find a point of contact - only recently have they added a contact us where live chat is once again an option. Pretty much nothing for the whole of 2020!
A refund of four months was offered but this in my opinion is an insult and would leave me over ¬£50 out of pocket.
God awful service - this company should be held accountable.",0
"Due to Shell not making the charges for call features such as 1571 voicemail visible during the ordering process, I initially decided to cancel my service. Of course, the only way to do this was to phone the company, and it took them over half an hour to answer the call. They eventually offered me 1571 at a lower price, so I did not cancel the service, though in hindsight I wish I had.

My service was due to go live yesterday but I still haven't received the router from Shell. Furthermore, the royal mail tracking information provided provided by Shell is not recognised by royal mail. Because of this is, I was forced to purchase a third party router and pay for express delivery, so that I would still be able to access the internet. This has cost me over ¬£40.

Furthermore, my phone has not been working since the switch to shell went through, despite paying a lot of money for anytime calls. Shell have told me I require an openreach engineer appointment to fix the issue, meaning I will of course have to take time off work. I have never had any problems with my landline and it was working perfectly until shell took over the service.

All in all, I thoroughly regret switching to shell and recommend avoiding the company due to excessive telephone hold times, charges not being transparent, failure to deliver equipment, and because they somehow broke my landline. Any savings I expected from switching to shell have been wiped out immediately due to having to purchase my own router and then take time off work for them to fix my landline.

Update: I notice in Shell's original response to this review that they suggested contacting them via instant message, however I have tried to do this several times before and the service has always been ""offline"" for broadband customers.",0
"Booked a repair visit for our washing machine for next Monday under our KnowHow policy which is paid up to date and valid until June 22.

I started arguing and he hung up.
How did someone know I had an appointment booked for Monday!! This can only be from a data breach at KnowHow. This is appauling.",0
Dishwasher stopped working repair guy came out on the 29th June needed to order parts he told me someone would be in touch to rebook. No one got in touch I had to rephone them to rebook in date for this 15 July.

I phoned them 2 hours later they told me they had the part but there was no available appointments. So I asked them to activate their 14 day repair promise as in the contract that states if they can‚Äôt repair in 14 days I can have a replacement. July 16 phone call from team know how saying my replacement has been rejected as they have suspended these due to the current situation and they can now come out to repair my dishwasher on Monday 20th July. Team know how changes the terms and conditions of its contracts to suit their own needs don‚Äôt think for 1 second if you take out a policy that everything is ok it‚Äôs not your the one left hanging around for hours waiting for them to first answer the phone and then for the repair guy to turn up and suffering due to not being able to use your item.

"Terrible customer services. They have messed me around for long enough. Have been chasing up Now Broadband for nearly a month - I shouldn't need to chase them up for weeks, they should have the decency to chase up their customers in a professional manner. Loads of miscommunication, they said they would resolve my issue of a missed engineer appointment. Nearly a month later, I'm still without internet connection and they send a vague email saying that they've cancelled my order! There was no need to cancel my order, it wasn't too hard to contact BT Openreach to arrange an engineer appointment - the following day after you cancelled my order, a BT openreach engineer rang to enquire if I had cancelled my contract! I was left fuming as it wasn't my fault that Now Broadband had cancelled my order. I'm sorry, for me Now Broadband is looking more like 'NEVER Broadband'! I have signed up to a different broadband provider now. My new broadband provider has said they should have me connected within a matter of a few days...",0

Absolute rip off. Too many colleagues passing me around with no one knowing what they are doing or what to advise.

"I am having major issues with Team Knowhow at the moment.

On 17th August i phoned (1 hour on the phone) to request a repair for my washing machine. I was told 20th which was good for me, to then be told there was an issue with booking and it would be transfered to another company.

I recieved a text stating someone would be there 24th. Then got a phone call to say it would be 26th. The repair man came on the 26th, he said there was alot needing doing and someone would be in touch. I enquired as to when that would be and he said hopefully the following day. Thursday afternoon I rang the company up (waiting 35 mins) they said the repairs exceeded to amount allocated so would be replaced. I asked what the next steps would be and they said it was to do with the Knowhow team. I asked if i should ring them and was told yes.
I was sat on the phone for over an hour and the call was dropped. I re rang - over an hour later i got through and explained what I'd been told. The man on the other end of the phone said there was no information and he would email them to chase it up, so should hear the following day.

The bank holiday weekend came and went. So today 1st September I rang again 1 hour 20mins my call was dropped. Next attempt 45 mins I got through. This man said an email had been sent but they still hadn't heard from them so he would contact them. He assured me he would ring me back. He said he was ringing them and did I want to hold i said yes but was once again dropped after approx 20-30 mins. I am still waiting for him to call me back after assuring me he would.
I did stress that I'd been without a washing machine for 2 and a half weeks and there are no laundrettes in my area. Also my partner has a disability in which a washing machine is a necessity.",0

"Why why why me?

After buying a laptop from PC Specialist 10 years ago and it still in daily use today, I decided to buy a new one from them again, I am a complete fool.

First problem was no spare battery that I ordered in the box, no mention of this in any of their emails.

Second problem was having to phone them as couldn't go through the process to start the laptop up, they eventually answered the phone and got me up and running.

Couldn't log into the laptop today, and after waiting a while for them to answer the phone just any excuse to blame Microsoft and giving me no details on how to contact Microsoft, which you can't do on the phone as I learned today, in a phone call to them.

Tried to phone PC Specialist again this afternoon, and getting told to wait 25 minutes before a call is answered, had enough, know when I am regarded as scum as they have had my money.

So this afternoon took my brand new laptop that was delivered yesterday to a local computer shop to have it looked at, after their advice I am now getting charged ¬£35 for a fresh Windows install.
Turns out that I they have had a few PC Specialist customers(or former customers) into their shop to get them fixed.",0
"This is not really a review of what happens when you go into the shop - the staff, in general, are pleasant, although they do not have great product knowledge, it is what happens next that is the real problem.
We recently purchased a dish washer and paid extra for express delivery, installation, and collection of the old machine.
The delivery arrived on the date agreed - Friday 14th August. I was surprised the drivers were not wearing masks but allowed them in anyway. From there it was all downhill. My confidence was somewhat reduced when one of the so called expert installation team asked if I had a knife he could borrow - fair enough I thought as he must be wanting to cut something...silly me...what he needed it for was to use as a screwdriver as he could not be bothered to go out to the van to get one. Confidence continued to diminish when he, after pressing numerous buttons, started to look at the instruction booklet - when all else fails!!
After around 30 minutes of pressing buttons and scratching heads they decided that the machine was faulty and would have to go back.
The drivers would not give me their bosses number but promised to phone me back with another delivery date. Around 30 minutes later they contacted me and said the new machine would be delivered on Sunday and I would get a text on Saturday telling me an estimated time.
Well Saturday came and went and, surprise, surprise, no text. By late morning Sunday I thought I'd better contact what is misleadingly called 'Customer Services' to find out what was happening....one hour later I eventually got a human being to speak with ...after telling her what my problem was the phone line went dead. As you can imagine...start of my first nervous breakdown of the day..
Later and after a strong cup of coffee I decided to try again ..yes, another hour of my life I will never get back..but this time a very helpful gentleman called John promised I would get my re-delivery on Wednesday.
Wednesday duly arrived as did the new set of 'expert installers'...well that was a joke‚Ä¶what a sense of humour this Company has!
It did not start very well as the driver was not really sure who he was delivering to ‚Äì he asked if I was Mr. ‚ÄòSomething‚Äô ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt make out what he was saying but knew it was not my name. I informed him I was not but I was, indeed, awaiting a delivery. He said he would check to see if he had it.
Once again neither driver was wearing a mask.
The machine was brought in and my old one disconnected but, when they started to install the new one they said ‚Äòthis is not a ‚Äòstandard fitting and we can‚Äôt install it‚Äô They clearly had even less skills than the original delivery drivers as they, at least, had no problem fitting it albeit they could not get it to work. I asked for their bosses number but they said they were self employed and did not have a boss‚Ä¶I know, unbelievable.
I now had had enough and asked them to remove the machine from my house.
I had by now decided to cut my losses and go back to the Perth shop to get my money back which I did. The Assistant Manager handled this very well.
I will never again darken the doors of any establishment with the name Currys over the door and strongly advise everyone even thinking of buying an appliance to go to a local shop (which is what I have now done and received wonderful service from Hosies of Broughty Ferry) and save themselves",0
"Vodaphone has to have the worst customer service going. You can never talk to anyone, it's always a robot, which doesn't understand you. Calls to Vodaphone only have options to put account numbers or Vodaphone numbers in, if you don't have either, as they haven't given you an account number, they cut you off. No notice that they were not going to turn up for installation, never any communication from them and to top it all, the broadband is rubbish. Continual buffering, even though they claim to be faster than my previous provider! Hopefully if they see this review, I might get to finally talk to someone. AVOID",0

Unfortunately the company that D&G awarded the repair to was very unreliable. My first request was returned to D&G as they said they couldn‚Äôt contact me. My phone is never switched off. So I had to start again. They then cancelled as engineer was ill then again as no engineer in the area. Eventually after weeks of inconvenience the repair was undertaken. So not a good experience.,0
"Waste of time, unvetted leads. We bought 10 job leads and spoke to one person and they weren‚Äôt interested in the work being done.

*in response to Barks response
- you flag my review as fake but then I prove it is legitimate so are forced to respond
- the get hired guarantee is nonsense, the leads are replaced with equally poor leads so there is no guarantee, just a chance to waste more of your time.
- every lead I purchase, the client is contacted immediately, still no response.
- the ‚Äúautomated‚Äù vetting is just a text message sent to the customer. It is not vetting anything, it just shows someone has a phone.

"We ordered from deliveroo for the first time tonight (26/11/22). We placed the order at 17:45. At about 19:10 the delivery tracker said the food had been delivered and left on the doorstep. However, we never received it. We contacted deliveroo and a rude women told us she could not refund us because they tried to contact us (they didn‚Äôt) as they couldn‚Äôt find the address and then she said it showed as delivered. It was contradictory. Finally, we decided to contact the restaurant and they kindly said they will put the order through again but the driver (from deliveroo) never turned up to pick it up. Several minutes later, we called again and even they were upset about the situation and told us it is happening very often and many customers were not receiving their orders and yet shown as delivered (very suspicious). We received our food nearly 4 hours later (21:10) after they tried the third time. This is corrupt and there should be a serious investigation, we are shocked nothing has been done yet after all the amount of negative reviews (unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt look at them before ordering). They are robbing people blind. The authorities have to be on top of it as soon as possible. Otherwise, there will be more victims of this suspected ‚Äòscam‚Äô company.",0

I then went on live chat, the advisor was worse than useless! Kept saying he waited 15 minutes, yes but two streets away! This didn‚Äôt seem to matter that only that he tried to deliver, doesn‚Äôt matter it was wrong street! Then had the cheek to say they wouldn‚Äôt be refunding as he tried to deliver!

I rang customer services on 8th April to see when the next engineer would be out to be told it wouldn‚Äôt be until 14th April. The 3rd engineer came out on 14th April still with no part he tried to fix the oven with parts he had in his van but they wouldn‚Äôt fit. He then ordered another part and said he would be back the next day. He came back on 15th April and after spending some time trying to fix it, he said it couldn‚Äôt be fixed and would be written off. We were told we would receive a voucher to use online within 3 days. That was on 15th April. Today is 8th May and we still haven‚Äôt received a voucher, I‚Äôve rang customer services almost every day to be told it will be emailed soon. This is now 6 weeks of being without an oven, I am a key worker and I have 3 young children at home all day with my wife. I think the customer service is appalling, how hard is it to send a voucher by email please? I‚Äôm fed up of ringing each day and being told the same thing, or getting cut off! It will be emailed soon, it‚Äôs been sent to a manager. I would like this sorting out immediately or I will take it further. I've emailed over 10 times and am yet to receive a reply and the number I have rang over 30 times they keep saying they will chase it up and it's out of their hands. This needs sorting out, 6 WEEKS with no oven!! Your policy states 7 days if it cannot be fixed it will be replaced so you are already in breach of this.",0
"Your customer service is horrible. I was on the phone with you for a combined total of 2 hours today. In addition to three live chats that closed down mid-conversation. I was frustrated, then became upset (to the point of crying), and finally I was just angry. It should not have taken the entire day to resolve my issue. And it hasn't been resolved in a way I'm happy with. This is the bare minimum. Don't waste your time.",0
"My wife and I are doctors who have had to move house with our toddler in the middle of the pandemic. The house we have moved to has no mobile reception. We are dependent on internet and a landline for all outside communications, including for our own safety eg ringing an ambulance, or home working.

They sent the router to our old address in error, so we had to go and get it. We were promised that our new internet and phone line would start on 6/12/21. It got delayed a week - no reason given. Then it didn‚Äôt work, despite us getting texts and emails saying ‚Äúcongrats it‚Äôs working‚Äù (we had to drive 40 mins round trip to get signal to get those messages).

We rang BT and explained the above. They sent a technician, who established that BT had turned on the wrong line, and that it was an easy fix and would be done by the next day. A phone call to BT (another 40 min drive) confirmed this was the case. The next day‚Ä¶still nothing. They are saying it can‚Äôt be done until 21/12/21 - no reason given other than ‚Äúit takes time for system to update‚Äù. This is strange given the technician and others on phone all say it‚Äôs instant. They keep saying they‚Äôll call us with an update, which demonstrates the degree of irony we‚Äôre dealing with here.

Update 29/12/21 - still no internet or phone. So no FaceTiming elderly relatives so they can see their grandson unwrap his Xmas presents, or indeed contacting anyone at all over Xmas. We‚Äôve been ringing BT daily (with the associated 40min drive), each day we speak to someone different in a different part of the country, and the response is lacklustre and vague.

BT do have the audacity to bill us for December for a service they have yet to provide (or even given a timeframe for providing). They said they wouldn‚Äôt bill us, but predictably they have taken the money, which we are now also having to try and get back. The lack of remote working options is starting to impact my career. BT have likely fallen foul of the Trades Description Act, so sadly starting to look into legal options in desperation to try and sort this mess out. It‚Äôs the worst customer experience I‚Äôve had from any company (to put it in context, I‚Äôve never written a negative online review before, but this experience compelled me to do so!). BT if you‚Äôre reading this - please fulfil your legal contract and provide the service you are so diligently billing us for.

Update 1/1/22 - after further daily phone calls to BT (with the associated drive) the latest person on the phone said all the previous excuses we‚Äôd received weren‚Äôt true and he couldn‚Äôt understand why an engineer hadn‚Äôt simply been sent out to the relevant box to rewire it as needed, and so said he would arrange this for the next day and if we didn‚Äôt have internet or phone by 6pm that evening to call back. Of course we didn‚Äôt by 6pm so dutifully rang, to find there was no record of our previous call or of any engineer being sent anywhere. So now there is allegedly a technician coming to our house over next few days - it is unclear why given a technician has already been and we‚Äôve been told that the problem isn‚Äôt at our end, but if an actual person shows up we‚Äôre hoping they might be able to do something. But as of today - still nothing (except the December bill‚Ä¶.).

Update 4/1/22 - We waited in for five hours this morning for the technician, only for no one to show up. We drove out this afternoon to get signal, expecting at least a text or email cancelling the appointment - nothing. Cue another phonecall to BT - often this takes an hour, and you get a tour of the various departments, and lots of hold music - gets pretty chilly standing on the edge of a field in midwinter! - allegedly there was an ‚Äòemergency‚Äô this morning, hence the no show. No attempt was made to contact us. We have rearranged the technician for later this week. They haven‚Äôt issued a refund for December.

Update 6/1/22 - technician came today, checked the line, and said it was not an openreach issue but that BT have not done the things they need to do - the same things we have been waiting for them to do since early December. Spoke with BT manager, who claims it‚Äôs an openreach issue - now saying next week. Asked again for refund - hasn‚Äôt been issued.

Update 11/1/22 - phone and internet were meant to start today, as promised by BT manager; predictably, *still nothing*. Another call to BT - they still not even done the first step electronically. No timeframe given.

Update 17/1/22 - openreach technicians came today, BT have switched to wrong exchange again. They‚Äôve also quietly capped our line speed way below the guaranteed one. When asked re this they said they knew and were planning on telling us once our contract started. We‚Äôre cancelling and switching to another provider.

Final update 21/1/22 - what BT could not do in 6+ weeks, Gigaclear managed in *73 minutes*!!! My advice - avoid BT at all costs!",0
"After over a year of hell with these people, They are still as incompetent as ever.
No network on phone or wifi - no network being no way to make calls, no 3G or 4G. I lost my job and my property which I was renting. Agreed to cancel both accounts, but didn‚Äôt.
Then sent debt collectors to my home. Knocked my credit rating down my 38 + points and left me struggling.
In addition to this, they kept my information even though I explicitly said I wanted all my details removed. They kept it on file still.
After over a year of this, hours of calls, tears due to stress of the debt collectors - they‚Äôve only just cancelled this account and are REFUSING compensation.
Disgusting values in this company.",0
"Ordered a tv paid ¬£550 in vouchers, got date tv to be delivered took day off work sold old tv job done.
Day before/ evening by time picked up the message message order not generated go to shop reorder. Where they wanted me to pay another ¬£550 and wait for refund in vouchers. Staff in shop great reordered.
Delivery date day after the original date only had to take half day off work. Paid for delivery as needed Tv quickly.
Hour before end of delivery time got automatic massage unforeseen circumstances delivery can not be made today phone this number.
Told van broken down , refund delivery if a want to complaint do so after delivery.
As I didn‚Äôt like the attitude of the person on the phone I went up the store the guy very understand looked on the system it said the tv was still in the warehouse and had not gone out for delivery. He spoke in the manager of the warehouse who said the van had broken down and they couldn‚Äôt get anyone out to it the 2 hours. I believe he may not have been telling the truth. As system said tv in warehouse.
Got tv delivered today tried phone number to complain lines down.

"Terrible service. Reduced the offer by ¬£85 because of alleged damage. I asked for pictures and they sent images of a totally different handset, not even the correct model. After over 2 weeks of emails back and to, I just asked for the handset back. Got the full offer price from a different company.
Mazuma replied to this review saying I didn't respond to them. I did. I sent photos of my phone and they did accept by email that the photo evidence sent to me was a different handset ""sent in error""
When they did send correct photos, there were still not the allowed ""up to 5 scratches"" but they would still not give me the offer price. GoodBuyTech gave me the full value.",0

"Switched my TV, broadband and telephone to BT. Openreach engineer installed the equipment inside my home on the 6 September 2022 but stated that there was a problem with the outside cable but I'd be fully connected by the end of the day. It is now the 18 September 2022 and I'm still not connected. BT have given me several dates of when the Openreach engineer is coming back to connect me but no-one is turning up.
Hopefully the Ombudsman will be able to help.
Two of my neighbours recently switched to BT and they were connected the day the Openreach engineer attended their property.
20 September 2022 received a voicemail from BT stating that Openreach will attend on the 27 September 2022 to connect me because they need to install/replace a new cable/wire outside in the fields.On the 1 April 2021 Openreach installed new wires and telephone posts so why are Openreach saying that there is a problem with the outside cable/wire.
20 September 2022 contacted BT through Facebook as advised but gave up as I wasn't getting any where.
27 September 2022. Openreach didn't turn up to connect me as promised.
28 September 2022 I have contacted Ofcom. Hopefully they will be able to help me get connected as three weeks have now passed. Every time I contact BT to complain that I'm still not connected, BT send me an email stating that they are investigating my complaint but a couple of days later they send another email stating that the complaint has been resolved! My complaint will only be resolved when Openreach connect me to BT!",0
"I cannot begin to explain how angry and disappointed I was with Curries. Having shopped for many years here I have always picked my products up in store.

This one time I ordered delivery as the item I wanted was not in stock for a few weeks. I explained to the person in-store that the fridge freezer being ordered had to be delivered upstairs (as that is where my kitchen is) and this was all okay and in place.

Fast-forward to the delivery date Monday 09/01/23, my order doesn't come.... Nobody calls me so I call up and was notified that the delivery was unsuccessful, turns out the driver had gone to the wrong house and not even tried to make contact with me to ask me where I was and just left with my item.

I had taken the day off for this, spent the day at the property and wasted my time, money, fuel etc etc. After a lot of hassle I manage to rebook delivery for Friday 13/01/23.

Fast-forward 13/01/23 and my delivery finally comes, I am met by a rude delivery driver who takes a look at the fridge freezer space and says word for word ""You'll be fu*ked if you think we are lifting this up there mate"". Defiantly worth the ¬£1000+ for that kind of exceptional service (Sarcasm). After a back and forth at my door they try to cancel the order and issue me a refund. I am extremely angry at this point and they leave the fridge in my hallway and that is that.

I call up Curries as the fridge is now in the property and I have to lift this 140kg fridge up the stairs by myself (which we do with no issue). So long story short it was a terrible service but in the end I have the fridge in the property and it works.

This doesn't come close to explaining the terrible, disgraceful service Curries provided from start to finish.

I have been given a complaints case reference starting CC which nobody has been in contact with me about. The initial compensation offer was ¬£90 odd which is laughable for the experience I have had.",0
"1st live stream of F1 was ok, some brief video quality drops. Watching past races on demand, up to 10 second sync lag. The UI is horrible to navigate and adverts on a ¬£34 a month (sports only) subscription, seriously. The ¬£10 one month offer is bearable for 3 F1 races, but i won't be renewing.",0
"Complete waste of time. I ordered a cooker, hob and hood from them on 31 Dec. Set a delivery date for 13th Jan which is the Friday before Kitchen Fitters, Gas Engineers etc. turn up. I get a follow up phone call (to sell me further cover) where they assured me 13th Jan no problems - everything was in stock (as it had been when I ordered)
3pm on 12th Jan I receive an email to say my delivery date changed to 8th Feb owing to out of stock cooker! During online chat they tried to fob me off to a supplier response on 48 hour turnaround, then told me their ""escalations team"" would call me back within 2 hours. They didn't .
I did hear from them next morning, where they were equally as unhelpful and unable to resolve my issue. I cancelled the whole order forthwith. Found a replacement cooker supplier who was able to deliver to me today. Cooker is now here. Suppliers should not be allowed to take people's money and then sell their goods which essentially is what appears to have happened here!",0

They did nothing, i received a bill/text for the fee, i rang up a further 2 or 3 times with long calls each time telling me not to worry it would be sorted, nothing done. so i complained they rang just now long call 40 mins, will not send me text/email proof that my account has been updated correctly so i will have to ring again to check. not sure if my credit rating may have been effected. it's not been good, avoid...",0
"I orderderd refurbished Iphone 8 on the 20/7/20, after 5 weeks of excuses and no phone I cancelled the order 21/8/20. The cancellation was accepted immediately by Quickmobilefix via email and quoted that the refund would take up 14 working days to complete. I chased the refund every week, they kept blaming covid and payment system for the delay. As at 22/11/20 I have not received my refund from them. I have contacted my credit card company giving the email trail as evidence they gave me my money immediately. I don't believe a word this company have said to me over the past 4 months and certainly don't trust them",0
"Moving back to NL after a year in the UK for work and tried to end my Broadband Service with Virgin Media via the only means available; the chat bot. On the first attempt I gave up after 40 min of holding and waiting for an agent to directly communicate with me. My second attempt failed after 1hr 20 min of waiting. I have stopped my direct debit with them, if they want the router back they can send the box, otherwise it is going out with the trash. Definetly do not recommend Virgin Media because of the non-existing customer service.",0

"I bought a phone from Musicmagpie on 1st of December to leave plenty of time for delivery for Christmas as a present. An empty package was delivered on 20th December so I contacted their customer support.

Firstly had to prove who I was because I sent the phone to my daughter's address, despite paying it with my card details and being on the billing address.

Was told an investigation had to be carried out and to wait 14 days so the Christmas present was out the window.

Waited 14 days and was then told there was no update so was told to wait some more. Was then ignored for the next ten days with no update so raised an official complaint with MusicMagpie, who basically just sent me updates ten minutes before their customer service department sent me the same information. They also repeatedly referred to me by the wrong name, a little more attention to detail would be nice. I signed all my emails with the correct name.

In the end I had to complete the wrong form for the postal service, despite pointing out it was wrong to Musicmagpie. Was told to just ignore that and fill it in anyway.

Finally, more than 7 weeks after my purchase they gave me my money back and said ""oops sorry it didn't work out this time"", despite me asking for another handset. So now I am back where I started without a present for my daughter, have missed Christmas by a long way and that same handset is now ¬£100 more expensive on MusicMagpie's website.

I have bought phones from this website before and it's been fine but their customer service is awful at resolving issues.",0
Have been with Vodafone since Feb 2022 ( BIG mistake ) and had nothing but problems with there broadband have had numerous conversations with there so called help team ( what a joke they are to ) still having problems till this day i wish i never signed up with them do NOT sign up with Vodafone although we have not been able to use the service they sold us we still have to pay a cancellation fee RIP OFF,0

Today ordered the iPhone 12 on a great deal to have the purchase cancelled due to a ‚Äòpricing mistake‚Äô.

"in reply to Virgin Media's answer to my last comment:

Why would I want to contact you on an alternative method when even your ""retention"" team was so poor that hung up the call without even trying to help me?

I have already cancelled, it's over. No more Virgin ever again. Not for me, not for any of my clients. When someone ask me to suggest a fibre provider, Virgin will be mentioned as ""STAY AWAY FROM THEM"".

Customer service is a major part of the service, it's not just about internet speed, and your score for CS is ZERO. You have confirmed it with your message below.

Reply to me again with an automated message and you will get another 1 star review in return. See if you actually read these messages.

Good bye

Hi there Billy,

Thanks for leaving us a review - we are sorry that you've had such a poor experience you don't want to offer any stars; that is not what we expect at all.

It's disappointing to understand you have booked your disconnection with us due to some issues you have had with our WhatsApp team.

We do have a variety of contact methods some of which may suit you better and I have listed them below for you.

"Extremely unhappy with the service I have received on my recent purchase in store.
I required a high spec gaming computer for carrying out heavy duty design and web development work and had researched the machine I wanted prior to visiting. After being questioned several times by several members of staff as to why I want this computer (this happens quite a bit when I go pc shopping as I am a young girl who people presume doesn't know much about computers), I then purchased my chosen item and told that they didn't have them in store but they had them in the depot and it would be ordered into store, arriving 3-5 days. There were several members of staff present and who checked the stock levels too.
Almost a week has now passed and still no news.
Only after chasing for an update today did I find out that my computer is out of stock and they don't know when it is coming back in! I am now left with no computer, and have to wait on the off chance that it will come back in soon. Currys seem all too quick to take your money, but not very helpful in the aftersales help.",0
I orded a tv on line got to the last part of the process and it stated there was an issue come back later . I got no confirmation email to say the order had gone through. Started again the on line order process got to the end and got an email to say it was successful but from this point all went wrong. Got 2 emails to say 2 orders had gone through. Phoned customer service the next day as was closed explained what had happened she cancelled the second order. But turned out they had been dispatched I had booked a delivery date. Nothing was delivered on the day contacted curry and no help at all. Turned into a nightmare didn't get any tvs asked to speak to a manager they booked a time never got back to me,0
"I ordered a new router from BT.(hub2). The engineer came to install it. It precisely told him where to put it and where to connect the cable however he decided do do it on his own and place everything where he wanted without listening to me. He left all his rubbish and just left. I called BT to resolve the problem however they kept telling me that it could be a danger for his health. He could climb to connect the cable near my roof which is about 6 meters from the ground however he could not put the cable where I wanted to which is only 2meters from the ground.
They offer you offers for less money only for the internet to be literally rubbish.
I will never use BT internet and I wish that I never got in contact with them to order.",0

"Made a purchase through the site for an account, shortly after the purchase the seller changed the account information. I checked in with the seller who provided a lessor account than what was paid for, so I initiated a freeze on the payment as per their guidelines. The seller then provided another account which they changed the information for right after responding to the freeze saying it was addressed and corrected. I provided proof within the warranty time frame to iGVault who then released the freeze and allowed the seller to take the funds. When I tried to contact them after they lifted the freeze they stated because the warranty had expired they are no longer willing to help. Both the freeze and initial dispute were placed during the warranty period but IG Vault refused to honor it. I will no longer be giving my business to a site that doesn't protect its customers.",0

Absolutely appalling company and service. If there was a way to give less than 1 star I would. I bought a 12 month internet package from them 3 weeks ago and for 3 weeks we have had intermittent service.

"Whatever you do.... do not buy BT. If you would like an honest unbiased review I'm happy to take messages or questions based on my recent experience.

I will explain with proof to anyone whose considering BT why they should pick any supplier else. I will even help any one free of charge to help find another provider

Seriously do not buy",0
"Very poor customer service. Moved address recently and called to move broadband. This took 2 weeks for them to arrange but that I can understand. However as soon as installed very low speeds and cut outs of the internet. Called NowTV around 4 times each time having to go through same process of them saying there was no problem then after around 30 minutes admitting there was one. Then they arranged an engineer which I had to take a half day off work for, to find the problem was with router. If they had gone through correct technical support first could have avoided this, instead you get reps asking same questions and same basic tests.
Now tv's reply to this is basically tough luck, but we will pass on feedback. Very poor customer service will switch an end of contract and not use again AVOID.",0
"Been with the company for 17 months. First time I have tried to contact the contact centre and the service is poor. They are unable to process a simple request to cancel my service at the end of contract.

I have emailed my complaint... however I am not optimistic about a response. I have also emailed a request to cancel my services.

From looking at the responses left by the company under the reviews, they just seem to be fobbing people off.

I do not recommend TalkTalk anymore. Poor service and customer service skills are 0. When you do get through to someone, its a constant hold before being disconnected and then system issues are blamed.

It would take them a couple of minutes to call me back. However if I was purchasing a deal, I am sure they would dialling my number with extreme pace.

A very truly unsatisfied customer. TalkTalk really need to step up their game if they are trying to compete with Virgin or Sky... Whom offer a much better all round service.",0
"Worst company ever! I cancelled my contract before install due to their incompetence and lost all confidence in them due to the appalling online chat function, and constant phone calls trying to get them to correct my email address, a simple task‚Ä¶. they then set up a direct debit 2 weeks after cancellation! I‚Äôve spent more hours trying to resolve this issue than I care to count! They also had the nerve, the gaul, the gumption, to send an email saying they‚Äôll charge me ¬£12 for a cancelled direct debit when they haven‚Äôt even got as far as the installation. Award winning customer service‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt think so!!!",0
"Constant signal issues over the past few years. They 'fixed' FOUR transmitters near me a couple of weeks ago and gave somehow made it worse. Useless customer services, who are not employed by Vodafone, but use an American company to handle calls, along with banks, media companies etc. Half struggle to understand, and they don't care.
My phone signal comes and goes constantly, it almost impossible to use the Internet, on both my contracts. What exactly am I paying for, and why is it getting worse (even after a fix!).
If you live in/near Guildford NEVER choose Vodafone. My friends, on Vodafone, ALL agree.
The most incompetent, greedy company I've ever had the misfortune to use.

Oh and ignore the custmer service responses on here. More lies and fake platitudes - if they meant it, things would have changed, but they haven't.

EDIT: I received a text to say the area's 4G and 5G has been boosted. No, it works less than 50% of the time now. What a great boost. Having taken it further, yet again, I was told it was congestion. All of a sudden, after upgrades and boosts to the area we amazingly have congestion. Utter rubbish, it's blatant traffic management, known as throttling. You are blatant liars, as thousands of people have said on here. And your checker never works, just like your customer service. I'm cancelling both of my contracts with immediate effect. Never, ever, ever again.
Oh btw their call centres are mostly farmed call centres that aren't their own staff and also answer calls for energy companies, retailers and banks. Greed.

Everyone I know on Vodafone, in Guildford/South London, says exactly the same thing.",0

Its unreliable even at the best of times. Sometimes you think the picture quality is excellent then at the most inopportune time it will either stop or buffer badly. I especially notice this in football games where an important goal is scored. I don't know what causes it to buffer at important moments. The Formula one channel is especially dodgy and could let you down at any moment. Maybe its the pressure on inadequate servers with the amount of people watching? Its not my 4g coverage as that is excellent and have no such problems on other streaming sites. Then at the weekend it took a nosedive. It stopped working on my safari browser and today the 15th September it stopped on all other servers. I am getting the message unable to sign you in. I am 2 months into a 6 month contract and can't even sign in to view the content. It seems now tv are very hard to contact and I don't know what I am going to do and have very little confidence of the matter being resolved by other reviews I have seen. Now tv servers are unreliable and they would want to invest money into them to get them as good as Netflix or they will lose more customers. Move with the times please,0
"Absolute disgrace of a company! My disabled father's contract was up after the 24 months and these scum bags still take money from his account, So I called up on his behalf to get the PAC to move to a sim only with another network, The customer service rep was arguing back and forth for 45 minutes to keep with them although the bloody contract was up, Scummy company and even worse reps!",0

"I won't be using eBuyer again, due to the poor customer experience. The website works, the prices are ok, they answer the phone after a few minutes which is good, but when they label you as a fraudulent transaction it's difficult to get out of them why. They leave you powerless and not sure if your order is placed or not. The more information you provide the worse it gets until they demand documents for you to prove who you are. When the demand is made they actually cancel your order. I think I would prefer for them to just do this in the first place. I sent the documents, passport and a utility bill and they did reverse the cancellation of my order.

I don't want the goods from them now and will use one of the alternatives.",0

"Ordering through curry‚Äôs has been the worst experience I have ever had ordering online.

Ordered a telly and it came 4 days late and the screen was cracked.

Tried to get in contact to get a replacement was on hold for an hour!

I finally got through to sort the replacement, the new delivery date was 10 days away!

Got the second tv and the screen was totally smashed! Gave up trying to talk to someone so I tried to web chat. I had to wait a further 8 or so days to get the second one replaced.- this one can through and there are 2 black lines through the middle.

Started with the webchat this time. And the agent said they have contacted the team, given them all the information and added notes to my file and to call them in the morning and they will sort everything out.


Called them this morning, no one had a clue what was going on. I was passed through to 3 different departments and hung up on. Was on the phone for over an hour having the same conversation.

I can‚Äôt get a replacement. can‚Äôt get a refund.

"Customer of 10+ years due to the highest speed offered (on paper). In reality, speeds vary greatly (when it's working) - our 200-350 Mbit service is frequently below 80mbit until we call and complain then it is ramped up for a bit, probably until a neighbour complains and they ramp them up instead.

Absolutely appalling customer service. 4 hour wait times are standard. 1.5 hours is minimum. No remorse. No change. Been this way for years.

But by far the worst part is the intermittent service. 6 day internet outage during Christmas when we were hosting family. Then 3 more 4+ day outages in January. Spent hours and hours on the phone when they knew it was an issue in the area and decided to just waste my time instead. Promised credits on our bill. Got nothing.

They need to go out of business immediately or a regulator needs to step in. This is well beyond the pale",0
Online order placed on 17th December with collection from Sainsburys local from 10am 18th December. No ready to collect confirmation came through so contacted Argos customer services on 19th December and was promised it would be ready to collect before Christmas. As no information or update was forthcoming from Argos I had to chase up any update on numerous occasions leading up to Christmas. They took money from my account on the 19th but for whatever reason my order never arrived and customer services didn't have a clue other than to be told by them that the stock checker is not real time so when it shows in stock when you place order the item could well have sold out hours before!!!!! So beware when ordering from Argos that you could well be told false information. Item never turned up and the period that I was told I would be able to collect came and went and then as no refund was showing on my account I even had to chase that up. Absolutely diabolical service from Argos I understand it was a busy period but it would have made life easier if they had been honest and kept me updated of issues. I'm sorry to say but Argos used to provide an excellent service but seems to have gone downhill.,0

The manager was extremely condescending and spoke like she was reading off an idiot board . Showed no emotion or sympathy for what had happened and let felt very belittled . However the young lad that first served us was more understanding . So now they have taken my money and my microwave !!! Totally unacceptable .,0
"Don't ever go in store. I went to the Cribb's Causeway store and took out a sim only contract. The advisor told me I had 14 days to cancel but no that I want to cancel less than a week later they're telling me there's no returns. I roped into a 24 month contract I don't need which will cost me hundreds of pounds. I would never agree to buy something like this with no cooling off period if I change my mind. Its absolutely ludicrous. All the staff are obviously trained in sales, perfectly polite to me in store, funny that I was misinformed via unrecorded chat in store, no obviously I didn't read the contract but who would go through pages of contract when I already had been given the information I needed from the representative. Its a complete scam and I wish I had read reviews prior to going in store I'm absolutely gutted.",0

"I bought a graphics card from ebuyer on Saturday 14/1/2023. It was delivered today. I then noticed afterwards that there is a 10% off code for ebuyer on their ebay channel which puts the card at just over 30 pounds cheaper.

I went on the ebuyer website to see their ""noble"" price match guarantee.

I called their advisor who told me that unfortunately ebuyer cannot pricematch against themselves and the only way to get the cheaper price would be to return the card (and reimbursing the cost myself) and then repurchase the card from their ebay channel.

This is unacceptable and a dishonest business practice. I would not recommend Ebuyer.com to anyone.

Update:
After further correspondence with ebuyer (Amy below and her colleague), they have confirmed that they cannot price match ‚ÄúeBay‚Äù - even though ebuyer are the seller.

This is because eBay are the ones offering the 10 percent code. Well, to profit from this 10 percent code- ebuyer have suddenly hiked their eBay price of the card up. It costs more on their eBay originally (before the discount code) vs their own site.

All these practices are of a very dishonest business, who puts their own profit over any credibility or right to do by their customers. I will be actively discouraging others offline and online to purchase from ebuyer.

A terrible company that does not deserve your business!",0
"I purchased a new Moto G9 sim free phone on Friday 21st May 2021 in store at the Kidderminster branch. I was asked to pick it up has late as possible on Monday the 24th May. I asked if the store could drop me a text or call to save me a wasted journey when it arrived ""no problem"".
I popped in at six, Curry's were open but not Carphone warehouse. So next day I rang I to check on my order. No one had been in touch as promised, I rang twice both calls dropped out automatically after a lot of music. Customer services said my phone was ready for collection.
In store was deserted with a few customers milling around, but no Carphone warehouse staff. I spoke to Jamie the Curry's Manager who explained both members of staff had called in sick and he wasn't able to get replacement staff, saying that they were having trouble with staff mental health problems. So I rang customer service again who were shocked at both members of staff being off. I explained I wished to cancel my order, but was told it had to be done in store. How with no one there, so it's now in dispute with my credit card company.
I would give you no stars for this appalling service and wasting my time. ANYONE READING THIS BELIEVE IT, THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ME TODAY..
UPDATE NEXT DAY.
I Phoned the Kidderminster store again, no answer. I know the phones are working because I rang them in store yesterday, I have to assume no staff showed up again. How can this level of service be possible for a company like this in 2021. I would expect some kind of response to this review, but responding to customers seems to be too much to ask of Carphone warehouse.
UPDATE 27TH MAY
Still no reply to the phone so I called Curry's instead they were able to confirm the Carphone warehouse was staffed and my order was ready for collection. Trip number four, I asked if the guy at the counter worked there, he had no ID on or uniform.
I explained I had been messed around and wanted my money back. At this point he went off to get a manager to refund me. Which involved them having to test a brand new phone for faults on a computer they use to test trading in phone (bizarre)
The Manager asked if I would like a different Phone? ""No I don't want anything from this store"" he then asked if a discount would temp me to keep the Phone ? But he a manger had to ask another manager to authorise it, Ten pound off. I replied saying I wanted a refund.
I would suggest anyone should use any other vendor than these Clowns.",0

"I recently wrote a review about my buying experience from Carphone warehouse which has been a disaster and now I'm writing about the trade in that finally happened 3 months later. I cannot stress enough how much this company must be avoided! I always had presumed carphone warehouse were reputable after shopping with them for 10+ years but clearly a watchdog needs to investigate what the hell they are up to as something has changed and it all seems very illegal.

I sent my phone in after fully checking it for scratches, dents and faults and had other people verify it was in absolute perfect working order, I took photos and videos of it as well to ensure no stunt could be pulled by carphone warehouse. I've had it quoted at ¬£200 trade in plus ¬£100 bonus for buying a new phone through them and just had an email through saying it has screen burn, is only worth ¬£20 and screen burn is ""impossible to tell during normal use"". Yes of course, because that sounds like a fully made up excuse so I can't argue with it! Clearly a the only available excuse as there's not an ounce of damage on it. So they get a ¬£200 phone, I get ¬£20 and they get the lovely resale value! What an absolute scam verging on theft and illegal! I've asked for my phone back so time will tell whether my phone arrives in the same condition I sent it which I fully doubt.

This whole experience has been awful from start to finish, they don't send VAT receipts, they don't have customer service, they send ¬£600 phones to completely the wrong address and now they offer ¬£20 for a ¬£200 phone cause it's ""broken but only we can tell it's broken"".

"See previous reviews for context.

Been waiting for Broadband installation since August 20th. It still hasn't been installed. What has been done? They've put a new socket on the wall, 10 minutes work.

I'm losing count of the number of Engineer and missed Engineer visits , broken promises, sorrys and people I've spoken to. I've had 3 or 4 messages of ""We'd like the chance to put this right"". How many chances do you need / want?

I've had 2 cast iron guarantees that it would be installed in the last 2 weeks and still it hasn't.

I was given an installation date of 3rd November that on discussions with BT they stated that that's just not right. It won't even be done by the 3rd now.

Openreach is blamed, BT Enterprise are powerless to do anything.

I've escalated it to executive complaints, still not installed.

The latest? They can't get to the cables as they're buried under Concrete. If they came around the 20th September when I ordered, it wouldn't be a problem.

I've lost circa ¬£1000 due to this debacle and they've credited my account ¬£51. Money first, right BT?

I had to travel by bus last week with bone spurs in my back, a 13 hour day, Monday to Friday, they promised I wouldn't have to and my Broadband would be installed.

It wasn't, it was agony and I had to work ridiculously hard to save my job. None of this sinks in with the people I communicate with, I just get endless apologies. Action speaks louder than words. noone cares about the affects this is having on my health.

But they just don't care. They don't care about the people most in need. Read the replies to their old people promotion on their Twitter page to see how they treat old people and disabled people. They push you onto DM's under the guise of GDPR but they just don't want negative publicity.

That's the only thing they seem to be good at, endless promotion.

They continue to push people onto Twitter and Facebook DM's so they can stay out of view (that's the truth, they don't want it visible).

You're a communications company, why aren't you calling them?

All they care about is ¬£¬£¬£. All you get is sorries, placation and copy and paste replies. Someone at BT needs to look into Whistleblowers protection. Someone needs to blow this wide open, particularly if you genuinely care about BT's customers

Noone takes responsibility or ownership, they just pass the buck. I've spoken to a few well meaning people who are powerless.

I won't go on Twitter, I'm just counting down the 7 days until I can report BT to the Omdudsman. If that doesn't get anywhere, I'll consider legal action. I've asked twice for a deadlock letter, Still haven't received one.

A billion Pound company should be able to install Broadband to 1 residential property but they're too inept to do it.

Sadly it seems beyond them.

BT's Slogan ""We connect for good"" on Twitter is frankly meaningless and a case of perverted humour at this point in time.

Blaming Openreach when they're a BT owned company is beyond dumb. If you can't get them to act, who can?

Then, on your mobile or tablet, you see the Casting button but it just doesn't work - or at least you need to try multiple times until it does.
Now, contacting their online chat, the representative spent more time trying to sell me memberships and Boost than trying to help me, then they told me that you can't use Chromecast without a Boost (which obviously costs extra) because ""you can't watch in 2 devices at the same time"" and for Now, using a Chromecast will be detected as watching in 2 devices simultaneously even though that's not the case - so you either pay extra or you can't watch it on your TV if it doesn't support their native app.

"This is to notify you that I have been with D&G for nearly 2 years now. And I have had the worst experience ever using this particular Company!!!

I was so much frustrated with their service that I was forced to cancel all existing policies just a week ago.

I was also going to have more gadgets under their insurance cover but not any more after the most recent horrible experience!

I highly recommend everyone to back off now! It's never too late than losing your money for waste!",0

"As a hypnotherapist I am constantly bombarded with emails to buy leads. They have never vetted me or any other therapist so any Tom Dick or Harry can buy the leads.
We are talking mental health here and all bark are interested in is the money from selling a name to anyone who will buy it.
They dont even vet the leads since they send me (a male) leads for someone who has specified Female only.

"There should be a minus option to choose from, because it pains me to have to click on the one star for Currys!
Worst customer service - well in fact NO customer services given. Purchased an item for delivery to store next day for Christmas 2022, but there was an issue with delivery which I only found out about when I rang the store to see if I could go collect it, so I cancelled the item and purchased elsewhere.
You would think I should get a full refund, but no refund to date! I ordered on 16/12/22 and cancelled on 17/11/22. So far I have spent 5 hours on the telephone to a call centre in South Africa, a webchat, and two visits into the store that I made original order and not one person has contacted me by phone, or email to sort out my refund! Although each different person I spoke to said ""you will be contacted within 48 hours"" - quite obviously this is a lie. I am still fighting for my money back as my Bank has charged me on my credit card statement, but Currys are saying as they do not have the item in the store they cannot refund me. Well they are never going to have it in store as I cancelled it!
Never and I mean never, will I purchase or recommend Currys to anyone. You have my money and I have a cancelled order without the refund - how is that right? I feel I am begging for my own money back and frankly at this stage do not know how I can solve this. Store saying its not up to them its down to their in-house online ordering and the online ordering saying its not down to them. Frankly I do not care how they run their internal systems, all I want and am legally entitled to is my money back as I cancelled the order - incidentally I have the cancellation email saying they are in the process of doing my refund and I will receive another email when this is actioned - but nothing as yet. SHOCKING",0
"Sent a router which did not work. It usually takes about 10 min to get through to the support. Took another couple of hours to identify the reason why the router is not working (had sent a wrong model), at the end of the call they promised to deliver the right model in 48 hours. In 2 days we had to call again and it turns out that there is no request for redelivery. Took another couple of hours to request redelivery again which will be in 2 days again at the earliest. We were supposed to receive a confirmation message about the new delivery planned. 2 hours passed, still no messages.
Do not recommend.",0
"I wish Trust pilot offered a lower grade than one star!
I can‚Äôt believe these people can get away with treating customers so appallingly and stay in business, worst customer service I have ever come across in decades. Not only that C/S personnel are so badly ill informed about the company employing them, they use the easy way out by making up answers that mounts to nothing but blatant lies.
I made the grave mistake of trusting to tale my Vodafone contract through them, and from day one a series of shameful failures started one after the other, from sending my ¬£1000 phone in a flimsy plastic bag resulting in damage to the phone, so it had to sent back, and me having to wait again, to them sending me the wrong & dysfunctional pack of accessories which cost me over ¬£110, and I am still waiting for replacement for, to them refusing to send my proof of purchase, which I needed to forward to Samsung for my cash back which was part of the contract.
When I tried to return the accessories that didn‚Äôt work on my phone, I was told that they don‚Äôt want it back, and my credit will be sent to the bank within 4 working days
These 4 working days went for 7 weeks, and over 20 phone calls, and still no resolution in site
Every time I call, I have to recite my full details, and wait to be told that they are sorry, they can see the credit on the account and they will escalate to another department, and here‚Äôs a complaint reference number
These people are ignorant, and telling lies is the easy way out for them of any situation
I truly regret having dealt with them, and anyone entreating the thought of buying from them, you are in for a lot of of frustration, disappointment, disbelief, and anger.
(YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED)
(YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED)
(YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED)

Now my only way out is either to take them to court or let the credit card company deal with them
This firm should be held accountable",0
"Further to my previous review i've now realised what BT are up to. As I have found a superior broadband package with a company called Box Broadband at a much more competative monthly cost I am restricted from leaving BT as they put me onto a new 24 Month contract and I will have to pay a hefty fee to leave at the present time. I wasn't aware of this as I do not feel it was made clear to me when I was told that they were offering me the opportunity to change to a better package. I became very suspicious when I was told, yet again, that a better package was available very shortly after I had agreed to accept the new one. It seems that they will keep doing this to keep extending the time left on the contract every time you call because it deters people from leaving and get a more competative package elsewhere. I see that they respond to these reviews by saying to ""contact us by other means to discuss the issue"" but how about them phoning me to discuss it so I can record their response. I bet they don't",0
"I bought my PlayStation 5 in November 2020 for ¬£449.

I was sold insurance through a phone call in which Currys reached out to me near the end of my manufacturers warranty. I was told my item would be replaced if it couldn't be repaired.... So I went ahead.
Fast forward a year and my item broke down so it went in for a repair.

After a couple of days, Currys issued me a voucher for EXACTLY what I paid for my item - over two years ago.

The issue is, I can no longer buy a PlayStation 5 for ¬£449 as Currys have increased their prices since then - they don't even sell a stand alone system anymore. The only offering is a bundle which includes 1 game for ¬£539. This is the cheapest replacement item.

When I was mis-sold the care and repair plan, the advisor told me I would receive a replacement... She didn't say I would just get a refund.

I now don't have my ps5 or even enough money to replace it.

I don't understand why they couldn't order a replacement to be sent to my home address.

I'm now going to have to spend my own time drawing up a case for potential legal action

Currys please reach out to me to settle this amicably.",0
Just another company that does not respect customers. I did order a sim plan online because I did not know the price was going to double after 6 months until I received an email confirmation saying it was ¬£12.00 for 6 months then ¬£24.00 for a sim plan only which is overpriced. I called the Three customer services at the same day to cancell it but they did not cancel the plan despite me calling in the same day and the next day and sending a customer cancellation form within 2 weeks which is customer rights. I received a letter from this company asking me to call them as they wanted to talk to me before cancelling the plan that sounds Harassment because it was not on the cancellation rights form and nobody answer the phone unless you have Three number which I dont since I returned the sim card on the same day I received despite asking them 2/ twice to not send me the sim. IF you planning to joint this company you should think 10 x before doing it. They just want get people's money no matter what! What's wrong with people!! just MONEY and no MORALS ANYMORE THESE DAYS. Evil people in this company they do not cancel contract ever just harassement and lies.,0
"I sent a message into your customer service asking why the deal I got was more expensive than on your website and no free brush and got no response.

"I‚Äôm leaving this review to warn everyone of the trick Domestic and General/ repairs service use.
I booked and paid for a six month contract with them for a gas combo boiler. Booking six months rather than annual makes me think the customer only wants SIX months.
I realised much later that Domestic and General had renewed my contract for a further one year without notifying me. When I challenged them to show where they had notified me the cut off all correspondence with me and would not refund me even though I had not used the service in that time.
Just beware as they will automatically renew your contract and when caught will ‚Äú cut and run‚Äù leaving you out of pocket and customer‚Äôs more disgruntled with the insurance bodies.",0
"Where do I start?! If I could give 0 stars, I would as they do not deserve a 1 star rating.
It started with me having a decent sim only contract for 2.5 years, they then wrote to me to say that they could no longer provide my contract and I would be automatically changed to a contract quite a bit dearer. I shopped around and found a better deal with 3 via Fonehouse which included a handset.
I asked 3 if I could keep my current number and was advised I would need to move it to PAYG and then ask for it to be transferred to the contract.
So on the 21/7/22 the fun began. My number was now successfully moved to PAYG and a request made for it to be moved to the new contract number. I topped up by ¬£15 as I was told it would take a few days. It didn't, the PAYG number was cut off within 2 hours.
After 12 phone calls and 25 days of trying to transfer my current number over to my new contract number, I gave them an ultimatum that I would cancel all direct debits and would return the handset. They finally admitted defeat. I returned the handset on 15/8/22 and they refunded me the monies paid so far on the 1/9/22. But I still haven't had my upfront cost refunded. During every phone call I asked if they would refund that. Even though I paid Fonehouse. They assured me that they would. Well today 12/9/22, I find out that they won't and I need to speak to Fonehouse. I'm currently on the phone to Fonehouse who have said that 3 should not have asked for the handset to be returned to them, it should have been returned to Fonehouse and therefore will not refund me!!! Oh the fun I am having with this. So far 3's incompetance has cost me ¬£184 with no way of getting the money back - Daylight robbery!!!",0
"We have been with BT broadband for years; loyal customers if you like. Our broadband service was ticking along nicely, even getting a good connection in the garden! However, the monthly premium started to creep up and up until we noticed on a bank statement that for a couple of months we had been paying ¬£72 a month! We had wanted to switch to Virgin for some time but they were not able to provide fibre broadband in our area, so that is why we stayed with BT. No other provider seemed good enough as most cheaper ISP's run off BT's platform (or used to). So we called BT to see if they could offer us a better deal. They offered us their super-duper fastest ever fibre broadband package for ¬£52 a month. We thought this was a bit high but we wanted to buy the best we could so we went with it. Well firstly, it turns out that they are taking ¬£55 a month but that was the least of our problems! To begin with, the installation was a complete 'bodge job', ruined our brickwork but they have said they will compensate us ¬£100. Still waiting on that! The first 'hub' they sent seemed to work OK but got steadily slower over the first week. We contacted them and we were told that we were given the wrong hub, the wrong package and the wrong information. They sent a new hub and this worked better again for a week but then just got slow again like the first hub. We have now given up on making endless tiresome phone calls to BT just to get fobbed off by them. My wife has now resolved the speed/connection problem by buying a couple of hotspot boosters for ¬£70. Thanks to her ingenuity we now have super-duper fast broadband..... no thanks to BT who still continue to take ¬£55 of our money each month in the belief that they are providing a good service.",0
Phone was traded in online 2 weeks ago and received by CW. Still yet to be paid being owed ¬£700 no phone contact available due to outsourcing their contact centres and not having any contingency plans in place for such. Yes I can understand at the moment that things are running behind in this sense but as a company if you can't honor your processing and payment periods then don't offer the service there are plenty of other suppliers that can be used. Contact them on Twitter and Facebook with very limited success and got through once on Online Chat and informed today would be the payment day but nothing received. This is one customer CW has lost I have been using CW for my phone contracts for the last 12 years and send numerous lines through work through them.,0
"Easily the worst internet provider I've ever had. I've had Sky, Virgin, BT and ALL of them are better than this horrific company.

I've had many issues including: being overcharged, being falsely told I'm getting an upgrade in my area and from them to then ignore my calls to upgrade because of their mistake, my internet keeps cutting out while I'm on work calls from home, the list is pretty long of all the issues. And now when I wish to make a complaint, their online live chat service isn't connecting me. I've tried on 3 separate devices (work laptop, personal laptop and smart phone). It seems so convenient that they give you no options when it comes to making a complaint, but if I were to cancel my direct debit, they would be calling in seconds. What an utter ridiculous company.",0
"My family and I moved to the UK in early July. We chose BT as our broadband provider, but after multiple delays and customer service so poor it boggles the mind, we pulled the plug and went with Virgin instead.

We were given multiple dates when our service would begin. Then when it did not, we would call and learn from a representative that our broadband service had been delayed. (Various excuses were given.) That in the 21st century a huge company like BT would not notify us ‚Äî by email, text, or phone ‚Äî that a crucial service was not being delivered as promised unless we called them, waited on the line and directly asked about it: shameful.

They tend to push blame onto Openreach. When two techs from Openreach finally came, they stood there shaking their heads and told us they did not know why they were sent to our rental house, as they 'do work underground' and our installation involved fibres and cables that were above ground. They said they were not authorised to climb poles. When we called BT, the representative claimed to have no knowledge of this visit or the issue the Openreach techs were referencing. The rep insisted that we still needed to wait for Openreach to do its job before we could get service. This surreal passing of the buck seems to be standard operating procedure for BT.

Even more appalling than BT's delays and work ethic is their actual customer service. They seem to be trained to apologise profusely (most of the representatives were very nice and extremely apologetic) without doing or saying anything proactive or useful to the customer.

The final straw was when we ‚Äî in utter frustration ‚Äî said we wanted to cancel our order after being without Wifi in a new country for a month and counting, with no indication this frustrating cycle would end anytime soon. (I learned from other Trustpilot reviews that this is not an uncommon experience, and could drag on for many months.) The rep curtly said that he would cancel the order. When my husband then asked him if he thought we were receiving acceptable service ‚Äî the multiple delays, the visit from Openreach in which they told us they had no business servicing our house, the lack of communication from BT about our account, etc ‚Äî the representative insisted quite strongly that he WAS providing us the service we asked for ... in that he was agreeing to cancel our family's Wifi entire order as we had asked him 45 seconds earlier!

This is customer service at its poorest. The real shame is that I've heard BT broadband is very high quality, but after this experience I would warn any potential BT customers to run away as fast as possible and choose a provider with at least half-decent customer service.",0
"Zero stars should be an option. I purchased online a 650 Samsung phone - my own bank verified the purchase and I received confirmation of the order. 5 hours later I receive a follow-up email..
""We have had to cancel your order as it did not pass our internal security checks. Internal checks are carried out for the safety of our customers and we apologise for any inconvenience caused. ""\
What a joke. When I called to query or ask about the problem, the CS woman said they could not say why it failed, leaving me no way to contest the decision which ""was final"" and I could try again in 30 days. When I asked to speak to a manager, a long wait and he wasn't available - shocker, not.
I'll never use CWH again despite numerous purchases by my family over 30 years. This is the worst customer service I've ever encountered and will spend my ¬£650 somewhere else. Goodbye Carphone warehouse. You may compare, but I'm definitely going elsewhere. Your customer service is atrocious.",0

So I genuinely decided to pick hmv over Amazon - firstly items were same price and it prob doesn‚Äôt matter but I saw hmv as like high street and smaller (prob incredibly wrong). It‚Äôs been over a week now that my item has been dispatched for click and collect. With still no other confirmation or correspondence from hmv. So I went into store for assistance (Glasgow argyle Street) to which none was given or offered. Was told just to wait for an email as there was nothing the girl could do or attempted to do. One question asked. On sentence replied and I was left standing with her moving on. I‚Äôm annoyed obviously but customer service is lacking. No wonder it‚Äôs easier in a non face to face situation.

The not so funny thing is the phone had IP67 rating meaning it was a waterproof phone which can be immersed in water up to depth of 1m for 30 minutes. The phone had never seem any sight of any water, let alone been damaged by water by us.
Unfortunately this is just another excuse by them not to honor their warranties quoted!

"AVOID

I'm just going to sum up;

** Laptop handed in 02/10/2019. Lovely member of in store staff said it's a simple fix, and they have a 7 day promise so my laptop will be back no later than 10/10/1992

** 10/10/2019 I call in, they're awaiting parts. I was told I should have my laptop back no later than 1 week, and that it's a ""14 day policy"" not the ""7 day policy"" that's on my >agreement<.

I also called to change my address around this time as it needed updating.

** 16 or 17/10/2019 I called repairs. The man on the other end was instantly aggressive to me. He said that I'm entitled to a replacement, I asked about the process and he tried to put me through to a different department, and said if I'm considering a replacement why should he bother fixing it. I said I didn't want a replacement and that I wanted my laptop fixed.

** Same day; I call back and go to customer service as calling repairs made me anxious after the way I was spoken to, and wanted to know if they had an ETA on the parts for my laptop. I asked If it would be quicker to get a replacement/voucher and not only did she say yes; that I'd get a voucher within 3/5 days via text, but that I'd either get back the full amount that I paid OR more than likely a better laptop. I said I'd think about it.

** SAME DAY I call back to just make sure what she said was legitimate, but the man on the other end said that I'd already requested a replacement, but of course I didn't. It was put through WITHOUT condent.

Next call; the person said the information I'd been given was incorrect. They dont actually specify that you'll get the full amount back of what you paid ONLY that they wont give more. And they said I'd very unlikely get the same spec laptop back.

Numerous calls between 17 - 21st as they still hadn't had the right address. They said my voucher would be sent by text by the 21st.

23/10/2019 Then I called back and they said it's not a text but it's actually a letter and it can take 14 working days. I was given wrong information. The bloke got aggressive and poked fun that if I had taken out extra cover above my care plan that they'd have reimbursed me for my loss of income, but I hadn't so they wont. He said I can make a complaint but no one will CARE anyway as it stays internal. Anyway, he hung up on me after saying my voucher is in the post and actually said ""it was posted via 2nd class"" and it'll be with me no later than 25/10/2019. I asked if he could see on the system that it had been sent and he said YES.

TODAY

24/10/2019

This one is hilarious, and my favourite. I call back to check they actually did muster the brain cells to change my address, and they did manage that apparently. Well done. Gold star. The person said that they'll kindly get that processed and sent via text asap.

They dont send mail apparently. So I was LIED to, to get me off the phone. And the rep ""Matthew"" said that the texts are delayed. Then he said one was never sent. As usual, Matthew, like the rest of the reps (bar one or two who were lovely) treated me with the same hostility as almost every other rep. He refused to put me through to a manager (or the manager couldn't be bothered to take my call, thanks Amir), he refused to give me any contact information to make an official complaint, he spoke over me and had less professionalism than my 7 year old sister.

FYI a few points:

Reviews often get replied to by a seemingly helpful complaints team, theres no way to publicly reply to these so you have to make new complaints. All you'll get is an ""I'm sorry"" email. My last email from complaints actually admitted that thier staff write off my property without my consent, they admitted I recieved poor customer service, and that's it. They dont fix your problem. They dont offer any compensation for the stress they put you through. So that customer service rep was correct, there is NO point in complaining.

Oh and do you wanna know the kicker? Apparently this ""care plan"" isn't actually insurance like they sell it to you. Its apparently (according to my sources) not protected by any financial body, so if you do try and take things further you have absolutely NO ground to stand on as they're not breaking any of thier made up rules.

I have a voucher now (or at least I was verbally given a code that may or may not be real. you'd think they'd send an email but nope, zero professionalism), apparently it can be given INSTANTLY over the phone, so I waited all this time for nothing. Not by any special team, just customer service through the care plan line. So if like me, you're being fobbed off, just don't hang up. THEN run for the hills and shop elsewhere.",0
"Very unimpressed with BT customer service. I moved from a rental property into temporary accomodation that already had broadband - leaving me no address to which my contract could be moved.

"My 24 month contract was up for renewal in August/ September of this year, I haven‚Äôt put much thought into what phone I wanted next so decided to continue on my existing contract on a rolling plan. I received a ‚Äúsales‚Äù call out of the blue from an advisor from Carphone Warehouse asking me if I wanted to update because they had some deals available, once I thought about it l called back and decided to move onto a new SIM only plan which reduced my monthly bill from ¬£75+ to ¬£20. I was told by two advisors, the one that initial called me and the one that put the sales through that the plan included unlimited calls, texts and 40gb of data. A few days after using the new SIM, I noticed that I had additional charges, I called EE to find out what these were and I was told that was from some calls that I had placed. I contacted Carphone Warehouse again and I was told by an advisor that the SIM that I signed up to was a data only SIM that didn‚Äôt included any minutes or calls. Every time I called Carphone Warehouse about this, they denied all knowledge of ever mis-selling me the SIM plan, even though I had all calls recorded and could prove what had been discussed - this was until I emailed the CEO.

Nightmare experience, they tell you whatever you want to hear to get you to sign up to a new plan.

My advice would be to shop directly with the network provider and skip these cowboys.

EDIT - Jim from Carphone Warehouse, there is nothing to look into. I‚Äôve cancelled my plans with Carphone Warehouse, this is just advise to others. You won‚Äôt ever have me as a customer again.",0

"Ordering was very simple, but that‚Äôs where it ended. Washing machine due on the Sunday, removed old appliance, late Sunday afternoon, delivery people call. Turn up, no washing machine loaded. Guys were great. Just rescheduled for the following week, had a voicemail to confirm, got through, eventually and spoke to a lady who obviously hated her job and a was as useful as a comedian at a funeral. So if there‚Äôs this many problems before the item arrives, God only knows what would happen afterwards. So cancelled before it got any worse.",0
Ordered a vinyl for a birthday and Xmas present marked as dispatched on the 25th and tracking still shows it‚Äôs not even with Royal Mail‚Ä¶ told me to wait until the 9th to see if it comes.. ( when clearly I said that is the day I have to leave the country to go see my family abroad). I said I want a refund instead and they won‚Äôt help. Shocking service. I will never order again and seeing similar reviews I suggest everyone not to either.

"A terrible experience so far when ordering with GHD. It has been well over 3 weeks since I ordered the limited edition Helios Hairdryer and Platinum Straighteners as a gift for my wife‚Äôs birthday - now past! The payment was taken straight away for the goods but they still have not been delivered. I have had multiple email communications with GHD who admitted that Hermes had lost the original order. They apologised and said this would be sent out again with Royal Mail and would arrive in 2/3 days. That was 10 days ago and the only thing to arrive is a GHD hairbrush that wasn‚Äôt part of my original order. I am not able to track this second despatch as no tracking details were sent. I emailed them again several days ago and they said they would get back to me. I then emailed and asked to be refunded my money as they have taken over ¬£300 as payment for goods not delivered. I have had no response to this request and the occasion I was buying the gift for has now past.
I am not sure if this review will be published by GHD but the experience I have of ordering goods from them has been terrible and I would not recommend ordering from them.",0

"What can I say about this company other than avoid at all costs! Don't be taken in by the sales patter, the after sales service and customer service is woeful. My 85yr old mother's TV box died. It took them a month to send a new one which doesn't work. So far I have spent 12 hours either on their online chat or speaking to a real person only for them to cut me off 3 times because they are unable or unwilling to help. I don't know what to do now! I can't get anywhere. My stress levels have gone through the roof. Thank god I'm with BT - they may not be perfect but compared to talktalk they are a model of efficiency. I wish I could give them zero stars.

Delivered two days later and fortunately I was home - I was given no notice of the redelivery attempt (three emails notifying me about it came through 8 hours after it had been delivered). Presumably this is mostly the fault of Hughes' delivery third party (Arrow XL) but (i) they decide which delivery people they use; and (ii) their customer service (after the non-delivery) was awful, so I am not cutting them any slack on it. Wouldn't use again.",0

"Like others purchased an iPhone 13 mini deal which was later cancelled after 2 weeks because of a pricing error even though it appears that they honoured this deal for some. They have also completed a credit check on 3 of us which we would like removed.

Generic email responses and offered a deal for those affected by the above only to find that the same deal was available on their website for all.

Have started a Resolver case but expect nothing given the responses received so far.

While pricing issues do happen to take 2 weeks to notify me after I cancelled another contract and buying some accessories is unacceptable.

My advice is if another company is offering a similar deal with a few pounds either way then choose the other company, just their Trustpilot reviews alone tell the tale that this company should be avoided.

If someone from the company does read this then don't ask me to contact you via social media as I don't use those platforms anymore.",0
"I have been a loyal customer for many years but not for any longer. I have come to the conclusion that BT the 2 year contract is a scam!!. The contract allows BT to increase your charges on a whim. I am extremely annoyed. I am now being charged over ¬£70 a month for broadband and anytime calls.
New customers get a better deal than loyal customers. An odd way to reward long standing loyal customers.
When I telephoned them yesterday they offered me the same service for about ¬£45 per month so why have they been overcharging me all his time.
I will be looking for a company who offers me a fixed price ,12 month contract. They are out there, you just have to spend a little time finding them.
I would be very wary of comparison web sites, many of them are paid by the companies they recommend!! Another scam!!",0

I was annoyed by this point as I had contacted them on 7 or 8 occasions via email saying I didn't want it, I told them I want it collected and it was arranged for the 30th of December, no one came,studio apologise and then said ""rest assured"" I will arrange it for the 4th of January, I said ok but very annoyed by this point, the 4th came and went,and no one came to collect the parcel, as you can imagine by this point I was blazing, and again rang Studio, this time I asked to speak to a manager, and she again used the ""rest assured"" statement,I will arrange it for the 7th of January ( today) and the bloody parcel is still here, I again contacted studio, but this time I didn't give them a chance to say or do anything, I rang and told them ""I will not stay in again 3 times I stayed in and no one has been, so the parcel is outside and it will be there until you collect it, should the box or item get damaged due to the elements I will not take responsibility, nor will I pay for it, as I have been extremely patient.....

I will as soon as this item goes back I will be closing my account and will never get anything from STUDIO again, absolute joke this company!!!!!!!

As you asked I contacted you via Facebook messenger!!!

This turned out to be a complete waste of my time, I repeated my self to several different people, telling me collection are between 8am to 8pm!!!! I told the advisors I know the collection times I also know that A email or message will be sent with the approx time and a hour slot, I explained I hadn't received a time slot so I know no one is coming, I was then informed oh sometimes it gets to 9pm and please be patient, I am in disbelief, 30/12/22 this parcel should of been collect then the 4th 7th and 9th and its still not been collected...

So tomorrow the 10/1/23 I will be contacting the ombudsman,because quite frankly STUDIO have had more than enough time to sort this out!!!!!

"Awful, just awful, trying to contact Customer Services to help sort an issue out on behalf of my 74yr old Mum who has been unable to navigate Virgin's impossible chat system, on chat now for nearly 3 hours re-explaining myself to each and every agent I get transferred to, each one asking exactly the same questions as the one before, each one not reading my summary of events (which I provided for their ease). I don't think I have ever been through such excruciatingly bad service in all my life. As yet I have no clear answer on how we proceed. I got so incensed by the process that I have contacted the CEO. I still don't know how best to proceed to solve her issue as the 'staff' at 'customer service' or unable to answer the questions I have, or just plain avoid answering them but asking me another irrelevant question. The customer service team seem totally clueless about the Social Tariff Package, and simply cannot answer questions about it. I even had to send the link over from your webpage about it, even then they didn't seem to be able to help. They just kept pushing to sell me another product. I am asking a slightly complicated question as I want to know if she can get out of a contract and on to the new up and coming social tariff contract for pensioners, but no-one can answer it, no-one knows when the potential start date is or if she can jump across when it does without fees.

Many times I get no response to my calls or emails, and often I find the work has already been done as the ad was scrapped off another site from days ago. I don't mind quoting and not getting the work. It is VERY frustrating when you pay for a lead but get no response from the client,but then get nothing back from Bark.

"I was contacted by their telephone sales and sold a better SIM only deal. I agreed it and gave them my PAC code to arrange transfer of the number to a network. When the order confirmation email came through warehouse was spelt wharehouse. So i called Carphone warehouse and they had no record of the order and suggested it was fraudulent. I then reported it to the police, talked to my bank, my existing phone provider and Vodaphone, the new network provider. Vodaphone believe the order is from Carphone Warehouse and is legitimate. However, carphone warehouse are still unable to confirm whether it is realm or not. I have wasted a huge amount of time and I am having a pointless conversation through Resolver where they are not offering any helpful solution or confirmation about the orders legitimacy. So I‚Äôm not sure what will happen. I have ordered a new SIM directly from Vodaphone even though a SIM has arrived from Carphone Warehouse. I cannot trust that one and will destroy it. I have to treat the order as fraudulent if they cannot verify it. I have wasted a huge amount of time and energy on this and Carphone Warehouse are taking absolutely no responsibility for this. Incredibly frustrating. If you have a choice never use them.",0
"I contact Powercolor for RMA as my GPU is 14 months old, and with lacklustre attitude they told me the retailer has to deal with it. And they don't deal with warranties.

So I contacted ebuyer about my 6700xt that's black screen crashing everywhere... On twitter. They wouldn't touch the card, not at all. So back to Powercolor who has simply ignored me since saying go to retailer.

Retailer refused until I mention my credit card and then they warn me it'll take at least 30 days from them receiving the card, as they will have to ship it off to powercolor and deal with it that way, after testing..

So if powercolor take 30 days and ebuyer isn't going to be urgent about it we're talking a good 40 days here, if I'm lucky.

Ebuyer states no warranty on their website, and after trying to start an RMA on their own website it says out of warranty, so obviously 1yr warranty.. On a ¬£720 GPU? You're joking right??

Overclockers, Scan and all the others show 2yr on my card, not sure what the credit card company will think of that.

Either way, it's clear Ebuyer and Powercolor do not deserve my money.

I'm disabled and recently had a heart attack (less than a month ago), gpu has been playing up for the past 3+ months but put it down to driver bugs.. If only I'd have acted soon.

Anyway, heart attack, cba with the stress,. Not being without a computer for potentially 2 months so that's that.

So not buy powercolor or ebuyer, if you must buy powercolor buy from a reputable company that displays warranty information, and then save the page as PDF and pay by credit card.

What sort of scam do they have going where they show no warranty and need you to force them to deal with it with threats?",0
If you have an issue with your connection customer service is a very long wait. Even when you get to speak to someone what is agreed doesn't happen so you need to make multiple calls to get a resolution. We have been cut off for a month and been without a router for 2 weeks. We changed to Gigaclear and the service is excellent. I appreciate that some people will have no issues with BT as they dont have any breakdowns so donr get the customer service experience although they are getting a rare beast in recent times.,0

This is the worst iv ever been treated Iv stopped my d debit. Do not use shell energy .",0
"If you are thinking of signing up with Shell Energy for broad band - Don't. Don't bother. I was with them for one year after they bought the service from the Post Office (who ran the service really well!). I am only pleased that I only signed up for a year and not 18 months that was offered as the communication was awful and the end of contract e-mail they said they sent never arrived. Just rang up to arrange a new contract and was told, when we eventually got through that because of where we lived they cannot give us a new contract meaning that we would have to go on to a non contract price ¬£12 more expensive than their best contract price! Unsurprisingly we are now signed up with BT! They should just 'stick' to selling oil and leave this to the companies that know what they are doing!",0
"yeah they are not worth signing up for the free trial.
luckily I had checked my statement or I wouldn't have noticed them taking the 15 euro out.

very sharp practise. I thought I had cancelled every pass but I hadn't and was charged for two months unaware. the person on customer service was very nice and he cancelled my bank card details.
don't sign up...",0
"Disappointed would be an understatement - I was contacted via email today to state my order had been cancelled, thus now being my third appointment.

Upon calling into branch and speaking with Daniel and Shea (both very helpful by the way.) I was informed that openreach had the audacity to cancel my appointment stating ""customer changed mind."" I absolutely did not communicate with them whatsoever, to my knowledge my appointment was still to go ahead on the 20th. Daniel tried very hard to rectify the matter, as I hadn't cancelled it and was simply told I had to once again rebook and appointment - he then transferred me to Shea and assured me that these details had been sent to Avital to follow up on my complaint. Shea then informed me that my order could not be connected AT ALL - there was no capacity at the cabinet for my to have broadband provided whatsoever.

I was due to go live on the 22nd of April - it is now the 15th of June and I'm being told after wasting 3 of my holidays and suffering months with no connection and an inability to work from home, you cannot provide it at all.

You now have had the gall to ""cancelled my complaint"" as if it is in any way resolved. Shea assured me he had opened another one.

I want compensating for the near 2 months of my time that has been wasted. You have now cancelled the order as you are unable to provide it... I have cancelled nothing.

I expect a response effective immediately - I opened my initial complaint on the 30th of April and in a further 2 weeks (8 weeks in total), I will have no choice but to contact the CIBC with the last 2 months worth of evidence and have them pursue this matter as an intermediary body.

1. I expect the ¬£5.25 per day auto compensation legally owed to me from the 22nd of April
2. I expect compensation for the distress caused, misinformation and time wasted. I have wasted nearly ¬£400 on fuel travelling to an office I don't need to go to and 3 days holiday accommodating a broadband you could never connect.",0
"Really appauling service when it comes to groceries. I have tried them several times and they have never brought all my items. On every occasion several items (up to half my list was missing), not due to being out of stock. The items were on the receipt but just not there. I will just have to stick to Amazon. A recruiter once called me from deliveroo and I just laughed. I'm not willing to join a failing service.",0
The repair didn't go ahead as due to the time slot given no one was home and when I contacted both domestic and general and whirlpool no one could help to assist the time I required. So I had to reschedule my repair stating the time someone will be home and even then they haven't assisted what I have requested.,0
"Do NOT JOIN BT!!!!!!
I only joined Bt 2 months ago and my bill has increased twice.they don‚Äôt tell you when joining so they increase the price as and when they please.that is very unfair as you could easily get into debt if they increase prices without letting you know
AGAIN DO NOT JOIN BT!!!!!!!",0
"Do not go near this service. I cancelled all contracts before leaving the country for 6 months. When I came back they‚Äôd charged me a monthly fee for the whole time I was away. Customer service acknowledged that I‚Äôd cancelled and they could see I hadn‚Äôt used the service during the period in question but could only refund me 3 months because of internal processes. I asked to speak to a manager but just got bounced around the same group of unhelpful web chat workers, no phone line. Feels like a scam.",0
"After waiting an hour they didn't deliver food even though the app said delivered, driver even called me to say he couldn't wait for more than 2 mind to which I said I was stood outside waiting for him.. no food delivered and still waiting a refund, this was first time ordered from deliveroo and will be the last, awful experience.",0
"Absolute shambles of a company. They could not access my account because I did not now the expiry date or the name of the Internet plan I was on. Answered all the questions about me, but you need to memorise their useless information.. Useless. Don't use",0
After waiting over 2 weeks I still have not received the item ordered. I have chased ghd directly twice as the courier has claimed to have tried to deliver this but left no card and I have received no confirmation of where my order is an order of over ¬£100,0
"Ordered food at 5 pm, by the time 6 pm came the app kept saying ‚Äúwaiting for another driver or driver waiting at restaurant‚Äù
Another half an hour went past and the driver had not moved from the location even though the app said he was on his way.
2 hours later I called Deliveroo which informed me that he was ‚Äúten minutes away‚Äù another half an hour passed where I then called them back again to ask for a refund,
2 and a half hours waiting for food which I know left the restaurant as I called them and they confirmed. So what happened is a mystery and either delivered to a wrong address or the driver stole had it for himself I won‚Äôt be won‚Äôt be deliveroo again.",0
"If I could give zero stars I would, don‚Äôt bother emailing customer service, they don‚Äôt read them and will not answer any questions you ask them.",0
"Dont trust this company. It has been 3 months and I have still not been refunded my 270 GBP. They have poor customer service, and their 14 working day returns policy is a lie. I would not recommend them to anyone.",0
"DO NOT GO WITH THEM FOR BROADBAND!!

i have been round and round is circles and no help given what so ever. they set me up, cancelled and then set me up and again to then cancel me again.

i have been trying to phone and get touch to find out what is happening and to ensure my account is actually cancelled and wont be charged as we have now gone else where seen as they cancelled twice. i find out that in fact it is not cancelled and that i am not allowed to cancel it and they cant cancel it either on their end. I ask to speak to a manager or someone that can actually do something and the guy said no no one is available. I try to get put through to a different team but you NEVER get put through so have to go round the whole process again. Finally get through to someone and she says the complete opposite that my account in inactive!!! at this point i am like what the hell is going on with talk talk!!

Still no further forward with my issue....",0
"Will never use nor recommend!! Have been charged for 4 months of service, even though I cancelled my account when I moved out. After being pushed from person to person was told that there is nothing they can do because they have not lodged the cancellation! Please tell me how that is my fault??? So annoyed and will be taking it further!",0
Placed an order during Black Friday sales and offer included a free gift. When the package arrived there was no gift included.,0
"Awful company. They help themselves to my bank account - sometimes ¬£600, sometimes ¬£90. How does it vary so much when I don‚Äôt even have a landline? Been fighting for an answer for years. They now need the account number from my bill, or they can‚Äôt help. But this isn‚Äôt displayed in full due to GDPR. Great get out clause. Thieves who simply crap on their customers.",0
"First of all I would say that 1 is far too high a score for this bunch of villains. If I could I would score them -1,000,000. They are a shoddy company who don't allow you to cancel. When you think that you've cancelled you haven't! They will keep taking your money forever unless you realise this.Customer service is non-existent and and so you cannot contact anyone directly to sort something out.And the online chat is a waste of time as the staff are overwhelmed with complaints and just hang up. So save yourself a lot of hassle and avoid these crooks like the plague!",0
"This review will be quite long, unfortunately due to the terrible experience I had with BT.
I first contacted BT in early January 2022 to order a broadband package. We had recently exchanged on a property and I wanted to ensure the WI-FI was up and running for when we moved in. I ordered the package online and selected a date for my installation which was Jan 28th. The package was on offer at ¬£24.99 per month. I had an email to confirm my order and all was well. The actual Wi-Fi modem arrived in the post a couple weeks later. I booked off the 28th Jan from work and waited at the property for my engineer to install the Wi-Fi. I noticed no one had showed up so I rang BT and they told me no one would be coming as there was an error with open reach. I was told I would be updated 2 day later. 3 days passed and I heard nothing so I rang up again and I was again told to wait 2 more days for an update. 2 days later I received a phone call from BT and I was told there was a delay somewhere with the order process and that I would again be updated ASAP. To make matters worse the employee started to try and sell me a new phone SIM card with EE!! At this point I was really losing my patience as we were still without Wi-Fi. One week then passed so I rang up BT and expressed my anger. A female employee explained that there had been a glitch somewhere and she apologised and said it would be best to cancel the whole order and order again from fresh. I agreed to this but expressed my anger. She stated she would transfer me to the sales department and would explain the situation to the sales rep. I was transferred and no surprise the guy on the sales team had no idea about what had been going on with my order. I went through the new order with him and he stated that as the sale had ended I would now have to pay ¬£27.99 per month. I expressed that was not fair but he stated there was nothing he could do. He then told me they would send a new Wi-Fi box out in the post. I explained there was no need as I already had one. He told me that they had to send a new one and he recommended when the new one arrived I simply sent it straight back!! What a waste of time and money that is! He then asked me my availability for installation with an engineer. I explained I had already been waiting nearly a month and needed it ASAP. He told me the earliest was 3rd March!! I went with this date even though deep down I knew I wanted earlier.
A day passed and I reflected back on my experience with BT and thought to myself why should I even be giving them business based on how they have treated me. I looked at TALKTALK and could see they could offer me faster speeds, cheaper monthly cost and most importantly a earlier installation date. I ordered with them. I rang BT and told them I wanted to cancel my order and told them the reasons why! The employee of the phone didn‚Äôt believe me when I said TALKTALK could give me an earlier date which I found extremely rude and arrogant. He told me the order was cancelled. A week later I received an email from BT to say my order was in in the way. I rang them up and questioned this sand told them I cancelled so why have I got an order coming. The employee told me that there had been a glitch cancelling my order so he would do it again for me. After 15 minutes on the phone he told me it was cancelled. But no. Again 2 days later I received a further email to confirm my installation visit from the engineer. I also received a parcel in the post which another BT Wi-Fi package inside!! I rang the AGAIN. At this point I really was loosing my temper. I was told that my order was not cancelled! The woman on the phone said she would cancel it now for me. And since then I‚Äôve heard no more!
To make it worse, I received an email from BT around 3 days ago to say if you don‚Äôt send back your kit you will receive a ¬£100 fee. I now had to send back all this kit and pay for the postage myself!!!

I am actually shocked and disgusted by this service and can safely say I will NEVER even consider going with BT in the future. On a lighter note my Wi-Fi with TALKTALK is up and running with no hassle!!",0
Cancelled my broadband 6 months ago and you are still taking money f**king impossible to get hold of s**t customer service,0
They managed to complete the repair but it was not on time and their is jo means of checking on a repair unless you travel back to the store as despite customer services putting you through to the store where you wait for 10-15 mins in a telephone queue to be cut off the store admit they don't have a phone in store so don't speak to customers on the phone. Customer services is a joke and they just say well either wait or go back to the store to find out.,0
Trying to change my package. To add internet and reduce the TV package. Somehow I have been paying for Sky for ages and didn't realise. So 4 hours last night on Chat and another 4 this morning. It's ridiculous. You just think your getting somewhere then they pull the plug. I've done the security questions 3 times yesterday and today. Hopeless can't give no stars,0
"I bought a day pass specifically to watch a premiership match and needed to cast it via Chromecast to my TV, which I've done a few times before. Had confirmation that I had paid for a pass but couldn't watch as screen said I needed a pass. Kept going round in circleseith thd same result. Eventually managed to get it on my phone but when I tried to cast it to the TV, it wouldn't allow it and I lost the match. Hopeless system of logging in on NOW TV to buy the pass and then having to use the app watch the game Then when I uninstalled everything and started again, I'm told that they don't support HDMI. Chromecast only works on HDMI! Can't be bothered with them so deleting and uninstalling everything to do with this company.",0
"It‚Äôs now beyond a joke and far too much time spent trying to get my air fryer delivered that I purchased a week ago!

The history of DPDs appalling service on top of Mark‚Äôs Electrical and lack of contact from either party. My history is well documented with the company and they don‚Äôt seem to care. Despite promises of a supervisor callback given by Mo on Monday I didn‚Äôt hear from anyone.
On Wednesday I phoned in again and eventually got Amy who agreed service was terrible and would ensure that DPD would get in touch to arrange delivery once again within 24 hours‚Ä¶.. this didn‚Äôt happen either.
It‚Äôs now Thursday afternoon and albeit I‚Äôve left 3 messages for a callback I‚Äôve gone from 9th to 7th to 19th place in the queue.
Terrible first impression! What‚Äôs happened to this company‚Äôs service? Trust pilot is full of recent scathing reports like mine!

I‚Äôve since received a phone call from Mark‚Äòs Electrical with an apology for appalling service and lack of contact. I‚Äôve also received ¬£15 to cover cost of taxi to collect air fryer from collection point.
What a shame things weren‚Äôt managed properly first time round which would have saved us all time and stress! At least they did follow up!",0
"Now TV entertainment used to be fine, I've had it in the past, and was offered a deal ¬£1 a month for 2 months. There are now so many commercials during every show it has become super annoying and after 1 month I just can't take it any longer. I will simply download the shows

"I like that I can buy online.
I don‚Äôt like that I‚Äôve bought my item on the 23rd Nov and it was only shipped on the 1st Dec so I haven‚Äôt received it yet.

"Deeply dishonest company. I renewed my contract on a promise from customer services that I would be provided with a hub5. Was told I had to call ‚Äòfaults‚Äô to arrange the delivery, who told me they don‚Äôt have any left and proceeded to try and patronise me with how a hub4 was perfectly adequate; for some it will be, but it isn‚Äôt for me and isn‚Äôt what I wanted - it limits the speed to less than a gbit if you are using a single device, and doesn‚Äôt have wifi6. If you agree to supply something then do it, don‚Äôt lie to get a sale!",0
I've ordered in the past from QMF without any problems - however the last two instances have resulted in no phone or order updates at all. No contact number available. The customer service team do respond after a couple of days by email. I've had to cancel the last 2 orders and waited without joy for a refund. Eventually I logged a chargeback claim with my bank (Barclays). QMF advised by email that they have approved the chargeback; so I have my money. I'd recommend getting your bank involved if you're not having any luck with the refund.,0

"Just over a month for my phone to arrive after many many MANY emails it arrived this morning ,
Two Things :
They couldn‚Äôt even send me the colour I ordered ordered a yellow and a coral one came -I can live with it the colour it‚Äôs not a big deal
The phone won‚Äôt even bloody turn on !!!!!!
This is an absolute disgrace waited a month for a phone that won‚Äôt even move past the stage of turning on ?????",0
"I have purchased an internet dongle from them, and soon came to realize that their coverage in my area is rubbish. Although their "" systems"" say there is 4G available in the area where I live, I was not even getting 1MB speed for upload or download. Long story short. A couple of days into this I have decided to cancel the contract within the 14 days cooling off period, and so the problems began.
Their - ABROAD - customer service advisors basically were bullying me into keeping the contract and were not listening to what I was saying. I am not an IT savant but I know enough to make an informed decision, plus it was my right as a consumer to change my mind if I was not happy with the service within those 14 days.
They have never advised over the phone that I need to wait and receive a special bag from them to send the device back in, and on their website under returns terms and conditions, there is no such instructions either. All that the customer advisors were doing, was trying to stall for time for those 14 days to expire.
I have decided to act according to the instructions on the terms and conditions on their website and return the dongle and accessories. Said and done. I have sent it via recorded signed for - THANK GOD - to their returns address along side the form.
It took them a whole month to "" find"" the device, as although it was signed for at the delivery address, they could not find it, then it got lost, then it never arrived. All different stories.
Meanwhile I was getting letters and emails that my bill is overdue - so paying for something that I have never used, or used for 2 days, and poorly because of their poor signal, usage was impossible.
It has now been several months of going backwards and forwards with their customer service team, all based abroad, no chance to even speak to someone in the UK; where they have failed over and over again to cancel this contract. Meanwhile my credit score is being affected thanks to them, because I appear like I have not paid my bill, and their throwing in their emails and letters stuff like we will send bailiffs if this remains unpaid.
I have had countless telephone calls that I have made to their customer support, and I have been assured that I DO NOT have to pay anything and that this will cancelled, that there is no way that I will be stuck in a 2 years contract.
Yet, they keep on failing to sort this issue out and give me stress, because of their slow and inefficient ways of working.
I would not recommend this company even to my worse enemy. Giving them a one star review is me being indulgent for the few members of staff that have worked hard to locate the device that "" got lost"" /"" never arrived"".",0
"Still waiting for a refund as I‚Äôve been over charged whilst they closed down my contract.
So glad I‚Äôve moved on from this once reputable company and they are now in my rear view mirror. So agree with the vast majority of reviewers giving them 1 star agree avoid them like the plague. Sad to say their tactics have all the hallmarks of a company struggling to survive in a competitive market Little or no service, holding on far to long to customers who have a legitimate right to leave, overcharging and not refunding customers upon leaving.

Which I could put Zero stars! Joke of a company and the customer service and aftercare is awful! Staff members all based in call center abroad and have no idea about anything. Ordered an I pad which returned 2 months ago and still taking monthly payments and no refund of orignal amount! Customer services claim they cant find details! I would rather whack my head on a brick wall than deal with this incompetant company again. Cant wait for my phone to expire to go elsewhere!

Avoid like the plague. Worst phone provider I‚Äôve ever been with.

"Went to buy a pay as you go phone (Worthing, Lyons Farm and was standing there for about 2 minutes without any acknowledgment. I decided to go up to the gentleman and there was not one smile or a hello! I asked for a phone and asked a simple question about buying on ee but not sim free and he just said 'No' abruptly and said you can buy it sim free and rudely said ""what colour then"". He just did not look like he wanted to be there and his manager next to him serving someone was about as helpful. He interrupted to say ""foreigners come in and but the phones cheap and sell them on"" hence why they cannot sell the phone unless it's sim free or you are using your new sim. Disbelieve at the shocking service, left and went to a competitor today who sold it as I needed with a smile. Called complaints and waited half hour on hold so obviously the poor service is a company wide issue.",0
"Repeatedly failed to pay insurance money they owe for a new washing machine, even when it's clearly stated on the policy, and the policy has been passed on to their customer services.

I've called nearly 10 times over the last month with 0% follow up from their team at any point (I had to do it myself).

"The most atrocious customer service.

Day 1 of using BT: Engineer goes to the tenanted property and installs the router at the furtherest corner of the property, inside a bedroom leaving big parts of the house without service (the house being a simply two bed terrace house). I call BT customer service to explain my problem and they stated this has nothing to do with BT and it‚Äôs Openreach I need to contact. I call the number BT gave me for Openreach and an automatic recording says that Openreach have closed their lines. I call back BT and explain the issue. They apologise for sending me down the rabbit hole and they advised that I need to contact Openreach via the website. Openreach response time is 5 days. This means that I have to be located in specific areas in the house to be able to use the internet - the living room is not one of those - for the week, with a new internet service provider.

When I called and spoke to BT customer service about cancelling, they were quite happy to cancel without a single worry.

I contacted BT and it was they who organised the shambles engineer to install the route. It should be BT who should contact the engineer to get this sorted, not the customer.

Btw the speed is far below par than the one promised.

Thank God for the 14 days of cancellation period. Searching for a new internet provider right now and so should you if you are looking to join BT.

Might sound as an extreme, based on the service provided so far from BT in my case, every 1 star could well be completely justified. Stay well away.",0

"SCAM - avoid.

I signed up to the free trial for 7 days and cancelled it. The company then charged me a total of ¬£25 in three different amounts on three different days for three packages I never signed up for. They refuse to refund me despite never having used their service outside the seven day trial.

In addition, the software is poorly designed and much more difficult to browse through programs than with NetFlix or Amazon Prime.

AVOID THIS STREAMING SERVICE AT ALL COSTS!

Edit: After several email exchanges and threatening to take the case to a third-party adjudicator they agreed to refund this money.",0
"I ordered online, for store collection, all seemed well. Within 48hrs the parcel was ready to collect, so I went to store and picked it up
The product box was inside a cardboard shipping box and having checked my address and order number on the sticker, I didn't notice any problem. Once home I opened the shipping box, only to find it was completely the wrong product!
I was back in the store within 20 mins of picking it up, but to my horror the assistant said they couldn't take it back, as DPD wouldn't collect from their store?!!! They said I had to take it home (they sent the wrong item!!) and arrange for it to be collected - this means staying in, which is why I went for store delivery in the first place, to avoid wasting time waiting in for deliveries. In addition, they had the item I ordered in stock at the store and they also stocked the item that they had sent - but they couldn't give me the one on the shelf and take the incorrect item into their stock - how hard can that be? and so much better for the environment too!
The assistant was helpful and offered to ring up and arrange the collection for me, while I was in store. She did this and said DPD would be in contact with a collection date within 48 hours and the correct article deliver a couple of days after this. So I carried ""their"" product back to ""my car/house"".
Well, a week passed and nothing at all happening, so off I go back to the store. Same conversation, different assistant, again helpful and she calls again. Same answer, 48 hours and 2 days etc. She could see that this had already been done once, but could not explain why this didn't work.
This time, not within 48 hours, but within 72, I got a collection date through and the product was collected.
Several days later I had a message saying they had received my return and a replacement would be sent soon - it wasn't a return and I didn't want a replacement - it was the wrong item and I wanted what I'd ordered, there is a difference.
It gets worse, 3 days later I received an email from Currys saying ""we've lost your product"" They were sorry but they had lost my delivery and cannot find it, they will be sending a replacement as soon as possible.
By this time, I wasn't surprised at all.
Eventually, I got a text to say my product was ready for collection, so yet another trip to the store (the 4th!). This time it was correct and thankfully I have the right product.
I ordered (and paid for) the product on 12th December, as I wanted it for Christmas. I finally got the correct one, after 4 trips to store, on 3rd January 2023 - over 3 weeks later.
No apology, no gesture, that's obviously what they consider normal/acceptable.
I would strongly caution against ordering for store collection, as it's basically the same as getting it delivered to a neighbour, only further to drive to get it!",0

"Got the three mobile broadband(mifi). It worked all right for a few months but now it‚Äôs absolutely horrendous. The speed doesn‚Äôt even work all the time, it comes and goes frequently. Have to restart the dongle about 5 times a day. Absolutely stunned at how slow the speeds are right now",0
"I am in tears of frustration with BT. Please if you are reading this do not use BT as when it goes wrong you spend at least 50min (each time) on the phone before the line either drops out, the person doesn‚Äôt have a clue what they are doing, they don‚Äôt know who their manager/supervisor is and it‚Äôs certainly not the person you have just emailed via their website because he left 4 years ago, you get sent through to sales because you need to spend more money on a service package even though the service you have paid for doesn‚Äôt work! But they will send an engineer to come out sooner than 3 days, twice in 2weeks as it still goes wrong, after you spending 3 hours of your life each time getting through to someone. My neighbours have also had issues but the problem seems to be passed down the streets after each visit. One neighbour was told in October it wouldn‚Äôt be fixed until December 25th - personally on that joke I would have asked which year!! Whilst writing this review my call to BT has dropped twice now after holding on for for an average of 20min to talk to someone regarding why the engineer I have been waiting for since Monday (it‚Äôs now Thursday) has been sent to the wrong address 2hrs away - yet another simple human error with huge consequences- not to mention wasted engineers time, our money and other customers waiting. I could go on and make many comical sitcoms based around BT incompetence - but alas I think people would lose the Will to live - literally. BT you are not the cheapest provider out there so stop relying on the hood name you once had, those customers are few and far between.

Instead I have to sit here waiting for incompetent staff and they won‚Äôt give me a refund because it‚Äôs lost in transit.

Awful. Don't even deserve the one star,

So fed up all becouse of their aproch with customers. I'm not ready to continue this. I am decide to cancel my contract becouse of Your bad service.

Worst company I have dealt with in my 57yrs. An engineer called 2.5 months ago to repair my cooker that we have paid knowhow insurance on for years. The engineer said he didn't have the part on his van and would come back in a couple of days. That was 2.5 months ago.

"Absolutely appalling treatment by Argos employee.

Our new TV started to break down after just three months. I contacted the manufacturer, who actually saw the TV working via a video link, advised me to return it and supplied a warranty code for its replacement.

When my partner and I arrived at the main Argos store, I explained the situation and gave the assistant the original receipt and the code for the replacement. She insisted on plugging in the TV 'to check and make sure we hadn't broken it ourselves' and said the fact we had a warranty replacement code made no difference. She then proceeded to shout across the store, in front of other customers, to her colleague saying 'this is what a TV looks like when someone breaks the screen'. She then accused us of damaging the screen ourselves and trying to get a replacement.
I explained that the TV had been getting slowly worse and that the technical department of the manufacturer had actually seen it breaking down, which was why we were being given a replacement, but this did not seem to make any difference. I also found myself having to point out that we are clearly not young any more and there are just the two of us in the house so could not see how we would have done anything to it.
After explaining the whole saga, not once but twice more, and the situation coming to a standstill, we were joined by a more reasonable assistant who pointed out that if we had dropped the TV it would show signs of damage, which it didn't.

As Argos didn't have a direct replacement in stock we also had to pay extra for a TV they did have.
We just wanted to get away from the awful situation we seemed to have found ourselves in.
The whole episode was demeaning, embarrassing, and totally insulting.
I am so sorry I ever thought it was a good idea to buy a TV from Argos and will never set foot in a store again.

Thank you, Christopher, for getting in touch. Unfortunately, as I neither have a twitter or a facebook account I'm unable to contact you via either of those platforms.
As I was asked to give my receipt number when leaving the review, I think you have all the required information you need.",0
"Be grateful if you read this before using this company....

Stay well away!

This is morally corrupt company that still claims on their website to do a 'quick' turnaround on phone repairs but the reality is anything else.

My phone took nearly six weeks to be repaired and that was the result of persistent emails and numerous failed deadlines. This company has no idea about the throughput of their workload and feels at liberty to avoid answering any sensible questions about this.

During this period of lockdown, it is patently clear that this company is bent on maximising its profit over meeting the needs of its customers, for whom it has no regard.


There are individuals in this company who should hang their head in shame. They deliberately mislead on their repair timescale and in so doing, potential place vulnerable individuals at increased risk while they have no access to their phone.

Take my advice, choose any other company over this one or you will be sorely disappointed.",0

After tracking my order, it stated that I has requested for my phone to be returned at 11:18am so my phone was being taken back to the warehouse. I was and still am incredibly annoyed by this. I didn't request for it to be returned so why on earth does it say I did? I received no emails explaining what happened at all. Incredibly disappointed. How do I get my phone back?

"What an absolutely awful experience! So i bought a dongle with the sky movie pass and the entertainment pass then spent hours trying to set it up! It seems to be crap at connecting to the WiFi and barely showing Signal yet i have full signal watching Netflix and YouTube on my smart tv, so had to move my tv to set up the Nowtv dongle, then put in the code online to finish the set up but after setting up my new account i was taken to a payment page although i had already paid for the dongle and package, after a lot of stress and time/hassle explaining to someone in a chat i was cut off, so started another chat with someone else who sent me a link to the same payment page and i had to pay ¬£1 to verify my card but this is not mentioned on the website or in the set up instructions! Then while trying to redeem the vouchers for the 2 passes the chat person sent me a message and interrupted it so i had to then explain and go back to the log in and search for where to redeem the passes. Eventually sorted it and then it updated but i need to move my tv so i can watch stuff which is ridiculous, the dongle must be very cheap and doesn't work well with the WiFi at all! After the month i won't be renewing it! Way too much hassle and stress. I've not tried watching anything yet as it's late evening so I'll see how it goes but am not hopefull",0

TeamKnowHow?
TeamNoClue more like.

I paid nearly ¬£300 on Sunday for a dishwasher with a pricey surcharge for special delivery today Tuesday 30/6. I waited in during the 4 hour time slot until 17:45 and guess what, it didn‚Äôt arrive and I received no calls, texts or emails and guess what else, the online tracking didn‚Äôt work either. So I called their 0344 customer service number but never guessed it would ever take them 1 HOUR 11 MINS to answer!! UNBELIEVABLE!!!

I still (stupidly) held out hope for a speedy redelivery but I‚Äôll give you one last guess, yep you got it, delivery would still take several more days. At that point I‚Äôd had enough and simply asked to cancel the order but, you guessed it one last time, I couldn‚Äôt!! Nope, apparently I have to go instore tomorrow to get a refund.

It‚Äôs almost comical and definitely one of the worst customer service experiences I‚Äôve had in years. Worth writing about for sure, people should not simply accept poor service as the norm.

Anyway, I‚Äôll post again tomorrow to say how I got on with the instore refund. Note the service instore at Currys when buying it was fine, to be fair. I think it might just be the apparently incompetent TeamNoClue whose shocking customer service forces customers like me away from Currys and on to other more reliable sellers like Amazon who actually care about their customers.",0

I have been paying the care plan for over 2 years now , my tv stoped working so I called KnowHow , they came picked up my tv and replaced it as my tv was unfixable , when It arrived it had no box, no remote or stand so I was unable to use it. I then called and asked for a stand , I have received 6 stands at different times but none that fit the tv. I returned the tv to Currys after 7 weeks as I was fed up with the broken promises from KnowHow, I have been promised a voucher so I can collect a tv myself but still no voucher , it‚Äôs been 8 weeks now and they don‚Äôt seem to be bothered. In my contract it say I will receive a working tv within 7 days so KnowHow have broken the terms of the contract. I have made complaint after complaint but nothing.

"Curry‚Äôs order for Hoover heat pump tumble dryer when delivered it was a lower priced Hotpoint condenser tumble dryer. I phoned the same day asked for a full refund inc delivery as they did not have it in stock for 6 weeks. I then ordered a Candy Heat pump dryer on line at curry‚Äôs as it is made by Hoover. It arrived 8 days later. I plugged it in and it sounded like it was a train on a train track going over a junction bang bang, bang bang. I then inspected it and it was dented at the top crumpled at the back & big bents at the bottom as if a folk lift had banged into it. I phoned them again ""not happy"" after phoning I reported the issue only to be told to phone back the next day at 8am as nothing could be done. I phoned back the next day which took over 30 mins to get through the order selection 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 and so on. I was told from what I was reporting they needed a return exchange number off Candy, I got told they had agreed to exchange and wait for an email 24 to 48hrs time of the collection date.
after 48hrs I phoned them back as I had no emails. another long wait on the phone only to be told the 48hrs are not counted over weekends. Still fuming that to buy an appliance has taken 20 days I said I wanted redress for the lost time under the trading standards rules, I was offered the delivery cost back which is why this review is 2 stars not 1 star.
I now have the date for collection and delivery of the replacement which is strangely this Saturday 28th Jan.
The replacement arrived and it I could give Currys 0 stars I would.
Up date:

Offical complaint.

So, Currys asked me to contact them as you can see. This is the email I have sent them on the replacement Dumble dryer.
The replacement Candy heat pump tumble dryer arrived and the team seen the damage to the original tumble dryer and confirmed it had been done most likely by a collection vehicle grabbing it hard.

WELL!
The replacement tumble dryer was also dented at the bottom corners & scratched.
I asked the delivery team to turn it on and the replacement sounds even worse than the damaged one more like a steam engine train going through a tunnel.

I have instructed the team to take both appliances away and I have requested a full refund.

So much for Currys claim of quality products & saving the environment with more energy efferent appliances.
We now do not have a tumble dryer as our old one was collected and we will now have to go to a laundrette that uses GAS tumble dryers.

But it didn‚Äôt come, then I get no information as to why or when I may receive the phone. So I call DPD and Carphone Warehouse who tell me they had lost the phone and that there was nothing they could do. I continue to call until I get a response and they tell me I have to wait for a search to be done for the phone, which takes a week. I ring up a week later to ask how it was going and both DPD and Carphone Warehouse were incredible rude and useless. They hung up on me multiple time, called me stupid, said my opinion wasn‚Äôt valued and when I‚Äôd ask off a manager I was either told no or hung up on. Fair to say I was livid with this customer service, all while they were charge me for a phone and contract I hadn‚Äôt even been gaven or using. Thankfully after much effort with no reward we went back into the store I bought it from and the two people in there where more than helpful and apologetic for what had happened and I did get my phone, 3 to 4 weeks after being told it would be delivered!
If my recommendation is anything, don‚Äôt use Carphone Warehouse! Their customer service is one of the worst I have ever received; rude and useless is an understatement. I won‚Äôt be using them again as a result of how they treated me, they are luck I still went though with the purchase of the phone.",0
Vodafone UK has zero service quality! Not recommended at all.,0
Absolutely awful service. i asked for a exchange of a new phone due to a manufacturing fault. they processed it wrong and as a refund even after i had called up twice to confirm the exchange which they had agreed was correct but they still messed it up. They cut off my service without any notification and i was left with no phone or service for 2 weeks. i was on the phone for a total of 10+ hours across those 2 weeks to try and get it sorted. i had to continuously repeat my self until I finally spoke to a person who actual helped me and made a difference and got me a new phone and contract. However they still have lost my original number that i have had for years and its still not been recovered. its been over 2 months now and they have not got back in contact with me or given me any sort of compensation/ good will gestures for all the trouble/ grief they have given me.,0
"Team Knowhow offered possibly the worst customer experience I've had in my life.

Tried to resolve an issue with a washing machine installation only to have multiple repairpeople scheduled to attend and not turn up. Was given the runaround by Team Knowhow waiting 30-40minutes to get through, only to be re-booked with the same result. After a few times of this and multiple weeks later without resolution they would put me on hold or just mute. Ended up paying out of pocket to fix.",0
"I ordered a meal through Deliveroo whilst babysitting my 5 year old grandson, never again! Driver called to say he was outside number 112. I confirmed delivery address was 4a. He expected me to walk down the road to meet him but obviously I couldn‚Äôt because you cannot leave a small child alone in a property so driver just delivered it somewhere else! Deliveroo won‚Äôt refund my ¬£23 because I wouldn‚Äôt meet the guy! Never use Deliveroo if you are hungry & don‚Äôt want to be out of pocket!",0
The worst internet service delivery ever sold. 48 hours of use and not one single device easily connects or stays connected to the internet. Why do service providers expect prompt payment but fail in their obligations to the consumer?,0
The third attempt at re-delivering my repaired was a SUCCESS. On time delivery within the quoted window. Laptop and power supply in the box and the computer worked!! The device went to Team Knowhow for a hardware fault - the fans. They kindly replaced these and also mended the keyboard as the letter 'M' kept falling off. HOWEVER . . . . . . . . the computer had been wiped and Windows re-installed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"Absolute joke of a company. Ordered broadband package a week ago and was told everything was sorted and would be active on the 17th June, the day after we move into our new property. I told the adviser it was essential we had this set up quickly as we will be working from home so need wifi. Received a text today asking me to call them, only to find out that the broadband order had been cancelled as 'they don't provide services to that area' which I know is a lie as our friends who live 3 doors down from our new place use NowTV broadband. Cannot understand why they left it a week to cancel, as we now cannot get anything set up in time for moving in and working from home so going to have to spend even more money on using hotspots for the first week. STEER CLEAR OF THIS COMPANY I will be recommending that friends and family never use their services in the future.",0
"shambles of a company. i have 3 accounts with virgin - they cancelled the wrong account despite my efforts to do otherwise, They promised to call back to fix - no call in 48 hours",0
"I've used now tv last year to watch GOT. Unfortunately the user experience was horrendous so I've cancelled my subscription right after. Yesterday I've purchased again in order to watch Blacklist S06 & S07. I must say they didn't improve a dime since. The app on the Google Tv is not user friendly. I have Prime, Netflix, Disney+ subscription too and compare to them Now TV is the most expensive one while holding the record with the worst user interface. The subtitles are too small because they forgot to scale it to the resolution. They also don't bother to add a settings options so people can arrange the size as they please. While forward/rewind you can't see a preview of the scene. They don't have a desktop app yet you can't watch anything from their website without downloading an hilarious app which sole purpose is to open their website and play the thing you want watch. The level of their digital failure is so unbelievable I think the sole reason they exist is the make people miserable and let them switch to Sky Tv with their life long contracts in order to watch their series in peace of mind. Otherwise I can't see a reason why the most expensive streaming service is still existing in business with such horrible applications while all they sell is Sky channels?

Without their boost service you can't stream multiple devices which is fine. The problem is their check mechanism is so buggy. Today I was watching on my phone for the first time then I decided to move on with tv. I've paused on my phone then opened the app on tv. It gave an error. I've closed the app in the background then tried again but no chance. Now tv can detect once you had another device open but can't detect that you closed the other device. I had to restart tv in order to fix it.

At last the only private streaming service who sells their services with ads is NOW TV. It's so complicated to find out how much you pay for the package you buy. If you check their website they generally give you the boost (ad-free) service free for 7 days. After they add ¬£5 to your monthly bill. Throughout the purchase process they almost hid it until the last page. It's like a secret package they are pushing your bag. I mean why not say it's 14.99!!! Keep it straight so we will know what we are paying. In my first subscription with them I've realized they are charging separately the entartainment pack and the boost pack. They are not even put them together on the transactions.

The only positive thing is their resolution is better than Netflix, but who doesn't.",0
Poor customer service from start to finish. Lazy in-store representatives unwilling to help or even approach you. Still waiting for a refund 30+ days later.,0

"Bought a laptop and collected it the following day.

Opened it and it wouldn‚Äôt download the software even though compatible.

Phoned and went on chat to say can i return and they said yes as long as it was in original packaging (proof as they record calls and chat log)

Then went in and they said no I should resell on eBay!?

Had it less that 5 hours at that point, all in its packaging and now can‚Äôt return it?

Policy says as well if it‚Äôs click and collect orders if can be returned.

If I had lied and said it was faulty I would have got a refund.

Awful experience and will never buy from them again.",0
"This is a scam company. They'll take your money and promise you a service but you don't get it, and then struggle to get your money back. It took me six months - and a chargeback claim through the bank - to get my money back after cancelling an order which was repeatedly delayed. Read other reviews before dealing with Quick Mobile Fix. I wish I had!",0
was with BT for about 5 years never had any communication from them emails phone calls or post regarding statements etc when checking bank statements they were taking over double every month and broadband was shocking therefore virgin was doing a deal in our area so decided to swap providers and thats when things got worse virgin informed them just to be certain i rang at least 4x and was on phone in a queue system number 13 was the best i got to after over an hour so sent an email after googling what i could do after another DD went out of my bank i cancelled that too then if by miracle a bill asking for the months DD payment arrived first time ever by post we then rang them and explained we switched companys over a month ago at this point they lied constantly about paper statements etc had been sent throughout our contract and that virgin hasnt corresponded with them regarding switchover at this point we informed them we were recording the conversation (for training purposes) they proceed to tell me this is illegal(isnt) was very abrupt and aggressive and said if we didnt stop he will hang up which he did this bill has now tripled we will be making a formal complaint if we can ever find a human to send it to!! to anyone thinking of going with them 89% bad feedback says it all!!,0
No access to BT email account for over a week. Apparently BT have no complaints dept and nobody to speak to at a senior level. I have spent 8 hours on the phone to them this week they promise phone backs that don‚Äôt happen. Shocking customer service.,0
"I am actually disgusted with the way Bark deals with their Elite paying subscribers.

Firstly I asked for my subscription to be cancelled without any mention of keeping me on, then silly sales tactics came through of 2 free leads to keep me on. Looks at your records for today 12-10-2022.

Given how much it costs to answer a lead with you, to keep a monthly paying client on plus one that pays ¬£70 for a batch of leads, 2 free leads is a kick in the teeth. To keep me on, 4 would be a bare minimum.

Further more, when I did sign up to become an Elite member, I requested a call to get my membership up and running so I can gain as much out of it as possible.

Instead no one called and when I followed up to ask why no one called, all I got was, sorry, reschedule.

Absolutely disgusting how you treat your Elite members.",0
"Submitted quote and agreed pricing quickly. The posting of the packaging also recieved in good time.

This is where the good service ends. Contacted by email shortly after the device is recieved to inform me the device failed a LCD colour test. Instead of ¬£200, they would now offer ¬£50 or I can have the device back free of charge.

I requested the device back as I knew there was nothing wrong with it. Upon getting the device back, I performed an Samsung LCD colour test. It was no surprise that it passed with no issues.

I have since sold this device to a competitor and it sailed through their testing with no issues, as expected.

I recieved slightly less than Envirofone quoted by ¬£50. I cannot help but feel the original quote from Envirofone was inflated to gain the business and create a false failure in order to secure the device at a much lower price. I wonder how many customers just accept the lower valuation rather than having the hassle of taking the device back?

This is my first time using Envirofone and it will be my last. It is a shame as they have a very good process but, clearly, their commercial model is not to the standard of their competitors. I am sure they will site higher test standards but I know this device had no issues with LCD colour having this confirmed from Samsung.

This experience has certainly left a bad taste.",0
"Contacted BT by message(txt) to advise 93 year old lady( mother)had no phoneline and was vulnerable. Message by return said initial check showed line ok but further checks would be instigated and further update in 48 hours. Nothing after 48 hours so txt again for update. By return total repeat of earlier message and they would respond in another 48 hours!!! Next tried online chat with agent. After advising my mother‚Äôs age and vulnerability, was informed they required my full name, full address, DOB, and mother‚Äôs maiden name in order for me to access my mother‚Äôs account. Explained that I didn‚Äôt wish to access her account but simply for BT to access and provide updated information. ‚ÄúNo our procedures require you to provide this information. What happened to common sense, these employees simply hide behind their own questionable procedures. Elevated the complaint and was informed I would receive call within 6-8 WORKING DAYS!! So much for vulnerability! Surprise surprise received phone call from Executive Complaints (after 30 minutes) where I was informed that my questioning of their procedures would be passed on but he didn‚Äôt think it would make any difference! Quite so, this company wouldn‚Äôt recognise a customer if it fell over one.
Must conclude that whilst engaging in this 3 hour struggle, Open Reach engineer visited my mother‚Äôs and fixed the external fault. Unhappily BT records still show this issue outstanding! Trustpilot reviews say it all, 13k reviews and 87pc rated bad. At least I know I am not alone.",0
"Terrible Company, We ordered a integrated dishwasher and paid for installation when the delivery men came they said Curry's had sent them the wrong information and they do not install integrated ones just freestanding so they dumped it in the middle of the kitchen floor and left. I then rang teamKnowhow ( Teamknowverylittle) which they apologised and stated they will send an engineer out in 2 days time to do the work which I paid for, So I took another day off work which I don't get paid for and the day came no engineer so I rang Teamknow nothing and they said ""oh sorry sir it doesn't seem an engineer has been booked for today"" so we will have to book another for 2 weeks time. Long story short they are liers, waste your time and money, Don't know how to communicate with eachother etc etc. Go with another company you will get treated much better. Also don't bother complaining to them as you will get someone just par you off. Team knowhow you are absolutely useless.",0
"I Went to purchase a Laptop and the only one left was the one that had been in the Store for a long time, I was offered this at exactly the price of a new one despite it being marked, upon my complaint via EMail to Customer Services I was told that to discount the used Laptop was at the Stores discretion.
So basically sell someone a second hand one if you can get away with it. This highlights the mercenary Company they are and the trash arrogant salespeople they employ.
Is it any wonder the share price is 35%down over the last year",0
Absolutely rubbish. I've spoken to them more than I speak to my own family. Every month since August. They're charging me ¬£3 a month for freeview. Tell them every month get it refunded and then next month it's there again. Persuaded me to go full fibre. They canceled the first date said I canceled it. Now installed but will not let me register my new account. So that's going to be another hour on the phone sorting it. Roll on next February when I can leave. Nightmare.,0

"Two months after cancelling my order I have yet to receive my refund. A recent follow up to customer service asking them to confirm my refund would be paid by the 25th November yielded the following response:

""Please be rest assured that we are doing everything to process your refund as soon as possible and you will receive notification from us once this has been completed.""

I followed up today (25th November - due day) to enquire when I can expect payment; I received the following reply:

We are sorry to hear that you still haven't received a refund in your bank, we have checked this for you with our payment provider and they have informed us that they experienced delays processing some payments owing to the current situation.

I have now received confirmation that your refund will be in your account on or before the 31st of December 2020.

We apologise for any inconvenience this has caused.

Took the 7 day free trial of movies and entertainment at the same time on the same day. On the 6th day money for movies was taken but not entertainment. Spoke to someone on live chat that said the money was taken because my 7day free trial was over (it‚Äôs was not. I still had 1 day left) also they didn‚Äôt take money for entertainment pass. Then whoever I was speaking to on the live chat disconnected the chat. Very poor service and will not be using now tv anymore!,0

"I closed my ¬£65 per month account in March and moved to NOW for ¬£20pcm. I was initially harassed by Virgin asking me why I was leaving and offering ¬£5 0ff a ¬£65pcm bill!! They did not send packaging for returning the router, despite requesting it several times and even thanking me for returning it.
The larger issue is that since March 2022 I have had confirmed 4 times that they owe me ¬£56 including a chatty call 3 weeks ago 100% guaranteeing me MY money would be refunded. It has never appeared. Conclusion: VIRGIN HAS STOLEN MY MONEY. I then received a letter saying they were happy my case had been resolved and it is now closed. I managed to penetrate the automated system with much difficulty and speak to someone who would not progress my complaint because I don't have an account!!! Also would not refer it to a manager.

I said surely after a 24 month contract I own the phone and they said your contract continues as the PAC is what cancels your contract.

"Virgin Media amended the terms of my original contract without my consent. They increased the monthly charge and altered other conditions. Although I received an apology - twice and a promise of a refund, nothing has been done. I, therefore, cancelled the contract and moved to NOW TV Broadband. Having studied the Law of Contract, I believe that Virgin have breached the contract and therefore becomes voidable. To add insult to injury, they have sent a bill (reminder) for ¬£328 which, although not detailed, is as understand for disconnection fees. Disconnection fees are part of the terms of the contract, which they breached, so I will not be paying this bill. If Virgin wish to challenge me on this matter, first they need to provide proof I consented to the new contract. Otherwise, I will be happy to meet them in court if they wish to pursue any further payments",0

This involved taking junction boxes to bits and using filters. The internet does not work at all using the filters supplied. Following this and another call to them I was told they could send an engineer out but, if all was fine when they got here, I would be charged for the visit. As this fault is intermittent, this I found totally unacceptable and asked to speak to a manager. I was promised the manager would call back. 2 weeks later and I'm still waiting for that call.

"So our household is paying a decent amount of money to have decent speed and its very rare to actually reach those speeds if you actually test your speed. With our previous deal at talk talk I would get the same speed in terms of Ping, download speed and upload speed at any time any day of the year. With BT its rare I ever get close to what we're paying for getting around a 1/30th of the speed we're paying for, for at least a couple hours a day. In this household there are people awake 24/7 and its honestly disgusting how they completely shut off the internet sometimes for tens of minutes at a time. We called to get support because their other methods of customer service are so painstakingly horrible all they do is tell you to restart your router and check if your device is in wifi range. Once we finally got on the phone after about an hour of waiting we explained to the troglodyte on the other side of the phone the situation they tried to say the same things like ""check your wifi range"" and we needed to explain that multiple PC's connected via ethernet at the same time were dropping speed at the same time and told them to do something about it. The idiot really told us to restart the router after swapping the router for a new one couple weeks ago. After his 2 line script of ""restart the router"" didn't work he went to the 2nd part of his training which was to shill ""better"" more expensive deals to us including their all new secondary ""4G router"" which was meant to be a backup for when the main one fails then I asked this incompetent worker how my ethernet only PC was going to connect to the 4G router he froze up and asked me to repeat the problem. Why does BT slow down my internet to a 1/30th of what I'm paying for? All in all, this company is a great massive scheme to sell you an awful service which doesn't work or works very poorly in order for you to go through hours of terrible support which gets you nowhere with the issue at hand and attempt to scam you into essentially paying more for another terrible expensive product which is going to ""fix"" your problem.

Rang on the 9th of January to cancel my contract was told I would get a call back on the 10th at 1815hrs never had that call was also told I would be put through to billing. I had to call tonight spoke with a young lady in Scotland who informed me she was new and didn't know lots of things ask to speak with her manager direct was told he wouldn't take my call. She then cut me off! Rang back spoke with a guy from Newcastle who told me that what 9th adviser had said was wrong and would put a complaint on the system. But doubt anything would be done about it Big corporation companies like BT really don't care.,0

A few day later they cut my broadband off, when I phoned to ask why,? they still would not discuss it unless I gave the credit card number and address its registered to although they could see the installation is at my address????, eventurly I managed to get someone to sort my account on line only to find the card they were applying from did not let them take any money, found the card details on line and still don't know who's it is, the reason I got disconnected with because they didn't receive payment from the card they had registered so I had to pay over ¬£60 in charges through no fault of mjne,

So they replied, as you can see. Even after 4 failed attempts they think there is a chance I will change my mind. With; ‚Äò So we can get everything sorted for you, please come and chat to my team on Facebook at facebook com/vodafoneUK or via Twitter @VodafoneUK‚Äô

"UPDATE - The day after the support person offered to enter into dialogue, they sent me another bill (although they confirmed my account was cancelled in Feb / 8 months ago), and a warning of debt collector! Have now spent another hour trying to get this solevd once and for all. No conclusion. Will this never end? Please don't go with Three!!! I wouldnt want this for anyone.
Don't go with Three. They follow unethical business practices and will waste your time for hours and hours on end.

I have had Three in other countries and loved them, so wanted to get them when we moved to the UK. I ordered a broadband and 2 mobile phones. After a few months of trying with boosters and with help from very friendly technical staff at three, we had to give up on the internet. They couldn't deliver the services, and kindly offered to end my contract so I could get another provider - or so I was told. Several months after I see they are still charging me (together with the phones, so didn't notice right away). When calling them to address it and get it corrected, they said it was never a broadband number so couldn't have been the case. They continued to charge me, refused to provide invoices or access to MyAccount, Still didn't cancel, so I had to stop the payments from the bank - Spent more than 35 hours on the phone with them trying to sort, and in the end they sent a debt collector. Still wont provide any paperwork for the money they have debited from my account, even thought they acknowledged on the phone that my cancellation was received months before",0

I then asked if I could cancel the order to which was told I could not cancel the order so now I have to just sit and wait and prey that my order actually turns up in time for Christmas. Be careful when ordering anything for a specific date as they only update online stock levels every 48 hours!! Meaning what you orser might not even be available but they will still take your money. Honestly absolutely shocking and the customer service skills are none existent. They don't have my items in stock but refuse to allow me to cancel the order so I can order from elsewhere, disgraceful if you ask me. Definitely will not be ordering from them again. Let's just hope that when I finally get my order it is worth the wait or there will be another review coming from me.",0

"BT (Bl**dy Terrible).
I raised yet another complaint recently when some of the equipment BT needed to send did not arrive. I was made to feel that, just because they insisted it had been dispatched, I was somehow lying about not receiving it! Really?
I actually received a call back about this ( a call from BT about a complaint is about as rare as hens‚Äô teeth). However the call did not go well as all the chap wanted to do was ‚Äòresolve‚Äô the issue to get me off the system! When I explained that my complaint was about the fact that BT do not have a dedicated complaints department and do not address specific things such as poor customer service, he said this was beyond his job description. I suggested that therefore my complaint should remain unresolved and this was obviously not the outcome his rigid parameters included. The conversation started to go around in circles which was frustrating and frankly, irritating. I got annoyed and ended the call.
THE NEXT DAY I RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM BT TO SAY THEY HAVE CLOSED MY COMPLAINT!!!!!! AAAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHHH",0

We finally managed to cancel our contract which consisted of many calls and constantly needing to explain what‚Äôs happened. Each call assistant either didn‚Äôt write notes from the call or didn‚Äôt read notes from the previous call assistant. Our problem was very straight forward and they dragged it out unnecessarily, we have now been charged for January‚Äôs bill even though we didn‚Äôt receive a service during this time and the hub has been returned. Also awaiting a partial refund which apparently was processed 3 weeks ago. Will never go with Three again. Not worth the hassle.",0

"Vodafone has declined over last few years. Network service unreliable, even though I have full signal on multiple devices, ""no internet connection"". They are quick to take your money, by not willing to provide the service. Customer service is terrible and takes you around in circles. It took me 1.5hrs just to get a PAC code. Before that over 3 hrs just to talk to someone. Vodafone is unable to resolve network problems in my area and keep blaming my devices. Tested with other networks and is works perfectly fine. I've asked them multiple times to resolve and failed. I'm leaving and going back to O2.",0
"The worst mobile provider! I was told I had free roaming, but I still got charged, then when I called them they told me I should contact them every time I travelled abroad to get my money back! Ridiculous. Of course I went to another company, but since then I've been trying to get my last bills to see what I was charged for, but they closed my account and can't see them anymore. I've been calling them 3 times already where they promise they will send me the bills, but it hasn't happen yet. If I had to describe it in one word, it would be: PAINFUL. Stay away! There are cheaper and MUCH BETTER options!!",0
"I was due to have an upgrade on my Broadband to fibre. An appointment was made for the 15th March between the hours of 08:00 to 13:00 I waited in all day for the BT Engineer to come at the time indicated. At 13:30 I had not received any visit. So on phoning BT at 13:30 I was informed that there was a problem. That I would receive a phone call on the 4th April not an appointment, but a phone call ! At no time while I was waiting did I receive any communication that they were unable to make the appointment in the allocated time slot. It was left to me to have to phone to find out the information. I find this lack of communication and also the delay and still no actual date for completion for the upgrade of broadband unacceptable !",0
"When they received my phone, they knocked ¬£75 off the valuation and said it was scratched - it wasn't. Requested it back and sent it to another company who offered the full valuation, which was more than Mazuma. One to avoid.

Any way I doubt I will be using Mazuma again and will instead take my phones to local companies.",0

"Had to sign up to their giga cube 5G WiFi for an 18 month contract because my flat didn‚Äôt have fibre broadband.

The WiFi was awful. It would always cut out but we had no choice. Would never use it again if we could avoid it",0
"Seriously don't go near this useless company. I tried to get a fibre connection from them and first they cancelled my previous provider before they managed to connect me to Vodafone then when the engineers arrived to connect the fibre cable they said they would have to dig up the middle of my new drive to lay the cable when i said this can't happen they said ok we will come back next week to lay the cable avoiding ruining my drive.
After a week without broadband different engineers arrived and also wanted to dig up my drive i explained to them that they should lay the cable along the pavement then along my fence hence avoiding any damage to the drive they said they couldn't do this and left.
I contacted Vodafone again and asked if they could supply a dongle to tide me over until i can get connected they told me they would send one the next day but after 3 days no dongle.
I decided to contact the company that lay the fibre cables along the pavement to the connection box which is called a Tobi box The person i spoke to confirmed thet it would have been easy to reroute the fibre cable to my house.
After 14 days without broadband and speaking to 5 different call centre people who all reassured me they could fix this problem i told them i would have to cancel this contract they said ok as a goodwill gesture they would give me ¬£20 for my troubles but no didn't send anything.
So look elsewhere for your broadband to avoid these cowboys.

"I have had contracts with Vodaphone for years and as the coverage in my area has always been pretty decent, decided to stay with Vodaphone but, to save money, change both mine and my daughter's mobile accounts to a new ¬£10 a month deal. And this is where the trouble started. Having ordered the new Sim cards and put them into our phones, I then contacted Vodaphone to request keeping our previous numbers. Surely this would be simple as we were moving form Vodaphone to Vodaphone...but no. I was told that I would have to wait 30 days before we could transfer to our old numbers and that in the meantime, we would have to use the new numbers as a temporary measure. I was palmed off with a 'this is an Ofcom rule' but the employee couldn't explain why. When I explained I needed my phone for work and that it was essential that I had access to my old number, I was told they would send me a new Sim card which I could have my old number on but that I would have to pay for both the old and new contract for a month. Not great, but at least a solution...or so I thought. The Sim cards duly arrived and after days of waiting, having requested a transfer to both the old numbers, neither Sim was working and furthermore, my daughter was unable to make or receive phonecalls. An hour and a half later, waiting to speak to Vodaphone, I was told my Sim was faulty and another would be sent out and that someone would phone my daughter the following day to sort out her issues. 2 1/2 weeks later, neither of these things has happened and I am steeling myself to make another (clealy lengthy), call tomorrow. To make things worse, Google is now asking me to verify my account which I can't as I am not on my original number to receive the verification email and have now been without emails for 5 days.
Vodaphone are an utter disaster. I really wished I'd moved company and requested a PAC code as I would have been up and running by now. Instead, I have had three weeks of chaos. I will be moving company as soon as I can and if you are considering moving to Vodaphone, my whole-hearted advice is don't.",0
"Absolutely awful Customer Service to deal with. I've been having intermittent internet issues (internet dropping entirely, dropping to incredibly low speeds etc...) which not only effects my general usage but also my work.

Speaking to their Customer Service Team (who seem to be solely offshore and apparently take 0 ownership of an issue) goes absolutely nowhere. Calls purposely disconnected, no follow-up call backs as promised, no follow up to complaints raised, absolutely nothing -- But you'll always receive their customer satisfcation survey on time, though!

Dealing with their DSAR Team is even worse. Refuse to give you even a first name despite asking for an abundant amount of personal information, then provide you your DSAR (without asking which preferred format you'd like to receive it in) via a Third Party company (Kiteworks) which doesn't even work, and is time limited access for 14-days!

"Agree with other reviews. Bad to the extent of feeling deliberately fraudulent. Once you have an account..try finding out via their on-line portal when your contract ends. Customer service is a brick wall. The helpline is hopeless, customer service via email is not an option. The only useable option is on-line chat.
Having terminated a contract recently we have had daily phone calls from Three.
There are too many other options available to make Three worth your business",0
"Just see other reviews... Shame there's not many providers to choose from..

Internet is good, but customer service is absolutely appalling (horrific, in fact!), they could not help me despite holding me on the phone and in chat for 2 hours, so in the end I had to disconnect and go with someone else. Too many departments, people don't know anything, they connected me to one from another, blamed each other and wasted huge amounts of my time and of their own employer. Massive shame for such company.",0
"My bill suddenly went up by ¬£30 due to the discount being taken off prematurely 6 months before contract end date. After weeks of deliberation VM finally agreed to credit being added with a refund to be transferred to my account 72hours later..still nothing received.
After 4-5 weeks chasing VM for my refund, weeks of agents telling me not to worry the refund will be issued in a few days, still nothing.
I‚Äôm still owed over ¬£150 and told time and time again that the refund will be taken care of and not to worry. This does not garner trust between myself as a customer and VM as a service provider.
On top of this, the service has been intermittent and the speeds have been awful.
Thanks for nothing VM. What historically used to be a great ISP is now being left to turn into a burning pile of crap. Well done",0

Rythm or Green Mountain energy at least pay you the same price for your solar buybacks, THIS COMPANY IS TERRIBLE and just wants to take your money,",0
"This is by far the worst network provider i have ever used. Their network does not work properly in LONDON. I still have 6 months or so left on my contract. i asked them if they are willing to reduce the terminantion fee because a of service failure from their side. But everyone i spoke to said they can't Make that decision. My questions to them was if i failed to pay my bill you will take action. But you are failing to provide a service and customers cant do anything. PLEASE anyone reading this review pay a few quid extra go with a decent network which actually works. You will get a discount with three BUT will spend 2 years in frustration.

I will never ever go with three again even if they give me a phone contact for free.

Where is the telecommunication ombudsman - why are they not doing anything about this. Customers are being treated unfairly",0
"From pay as you go to contact and a big mess.

I have been a pay as you go customer for quite some time using only the big value bundle so I was not tied up to any long term contracts.
I travel a lot and since the roaming has been removed from the bundles I had to look to a better option this being a contract that offers roaming with no further cost outside the contract. Jumped on a chat the agent suggest a plan that many times asked if it had abroad data included with no further costs and was confirmed(I have screenshots for prove) I was shocked to see a further charge soon as I landed in another country. Shocking‚Ä¶ the plan did not had this included! In conclusion I was lied to. Proceed to cancel the contract and look for other options as I need data for work. Contract was ‚Äúcancelled‚Äù, the day after looked on my account and the bill was still there, jumped on a chat and they told me it was cancelled and balanced applied. Day after boom another charge did it all over again having to repeat myself to different agents. Today boom once again another charge! I do not have a plan was cancelled less than a week after opting in and they not cancelled the charges or remove my direct debit to prevent anything from going through. After being lied to mislead and passed back and forth like a ping pong ball I gave up. Honestly thought getting in a contract the service would improve but has been the worse, bare in mind I work in customer service myself and I know how hard things can be therefore I kept calm, but this is a joke now.

They tell you to contact on Facebook and they do not help you and I have a complaint in place an no one reached out.

Still waiting for my refund to be processed",0
"A month ago I decided to change the landline and internet. When I searched online I came across Talktalk at a good price and service. I changed it but my previous provider insisted and offered me a good deal. I cancelled Talktalk within two days. However, I have received my first bill of ¬£31 even nothing to do with their service fee etc. I have returned their broadband modem which came 3 weeks later. They had time not to send it in the first place.
I do not like such big companies that do not have a well-trained staff who cares about what the consumer needs and wants and completes a simple cancellation without any pain.
I regretted contacting talk talk. I regretted hearing this company name. Now I cannot contact any of them. They will ask for my password, and phone number which I deleted as I have never used it and as I cancelled it.
What kind of business what kind of country we are becoming? I need to finish a project now. But I have to deal with the fault of the incompetent staff!

"Abismal network and coverage. I've been with 3 for 8 years and always thought okay until the last 12 months. Signal and data is just getting worse. More and more places I can't use it. I've got no WiFi as moving house and have genuinely ordered an EE SIM to tide me over until WiFi arrives. I can't wait to leave when my contract ends in a a few months. I joined because they had great extras, excellent customer service and the network was okay when balanced with other factors. Now none of the extras matter now, it's just an incredibly poor network to be part of and it's sad how quickly it's declined compared others! To make it worse I see adverts everywhere for their 5G network... Sort out the basics would be a good start!",0
"DON‚ÄôT GET TAKEN HOSTAGE!

Don‚Äôt get taken hostage by BT. Keep a very safe distance from this nightmare company.
In all my years in senior management including as exec director of a large company I have never encountered a more difficult and inefficient company. I am now in my 10th week of torment and I still haven‚Äôt got my contracted service despite uncountable phone calls and hours on the phone. Without exaggeration I have spoken to over 40 different people and on each occasion having to start again from the beginning to identify myself and explain my problem in detail.

I am now suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. I have become ridiculously appreciative of any communication from BT even when they ironically send me a feedback email asking how they‚Äôve done. This hopelessly inefficient company is ripe for a takeover.

"On two occasions I tried to buy a chromebook for my daughter. The first one was placed on the 28th Jan (order no658664064309). I even managed to get parents to sit in and wait for delivery as it needed to be signed for. However with no communication the order was declined. I checked account which is how I found this. I noticed the item was now out of stock, so I assumed that was reason. I then placed another order for similar item on the 31st January, thought it was a good deal as had been reduced in price, I ordered it, paid for it by card, and was told it would arrive today. However after waiting for item, I go to account page and see order has been declined. I assumed item has sold out, but I see that the same item is still there but now back at full price.(order no658683767246). This seems like a massive con that they can entice us with a good discount then refuse to supply goods, and I notice that the payment is still showing as off my account, so just now I am short of this money. A terrible experience, this has really put me off using them if this is how they treat customers.",0

Obviously they don‚Äôt get commission but it‚Äôs really not hard to be polite to customers, surely that‚Äôs the bare minimum for a customer facing role? I handed over my money and not even a thank you/ clarification of the price eg ‚Äòthat will be ¬£xxx please‚Äô. He just took my money and handed me a receipt- literally said nothing.

Worst worst company ever stealing my money. Even though I cancelled my contract one after setting it up i am being charged and the worst thing is no one has any information about my account as it has been cancelled.

Why those big companies trying to kill cash and forcing the small hard working people to pay millions in commission on card payments ,which goes to companies doesn't pay taxes in UK ??? Than they blame small businesses and they goes "" oh they don't want to pay tax so they don't want card payments """,0
Absolutely appalling. Avoid this provider at all costs. Customer service is beyond ridiculous. Lack of service for 3 days which caused me to miss an important call which lead to a charge. After 8 chats and over 3 hours they waived a poxy amount off for the cancellation which they then would not process because I couldn't get a code due to having no signal. The phone is now useless as it is a WiFi only phone! Pathetic!,0

When I complained first you promised it would be delivered for Christmas, when I queried a second time you said no chance it would come for Christmas and it's Royal Mails fault. The delivery has came now but no sign of the original which you said was 'in transit'. Then reordered my delivery which just came, so really 2 should have came but they didn't. Just disappointing really, speaking on chat was very unhelpful and didn't even try to get my order sorted.",0

I then received an email from them saying the phone phone had a smashed screen and would only pay me ¬£16 for it. I rejected the offer and rang customer service where I spoke to Andrew who told me to Google royal mail to put a claim in for a damaged item. I then had to ring back to ask for a photograph of the damaged phone as this is what Royal mail require for claiming for a damaged item. I am now waiting for the evidence of the damage. I have effectively lost a phone that could have been put to good use because the packaging supplied to return it was not fit for purpose.

"Ordered new broadband package 25/11/22.Initial installation date was 14/12/22. Engineers arrived early December to carry out external works to property. Installation date was then pushed back to 29/12/22 and then again to the 21/01/23. Less than 24 hours before engineer was due to visit I received an email saying installation would be delayed further to 07/02/23. I raised a complaint on 20/01/23 about the shocking service and the fact we have been left without broadband and received an email from Virgin's Resolution team on 23/01/23 at lunchtime. The email said that installation would be done that day (23/01/23) and to contact the preinstallation team to discuss. Rang the preinstallation team only to be told that installation would not be carried out until 07/02/23, the delay they explained was due to external works needing to be carried out. I advised them that the external works had already been carried out, that I'm sick of having installation delayed again and again and to cancel my order. The person on the other end kept putting me on hold and disconnected the call twice. When I asked about my initial contract and cancelling it I was told they couldn't put me through to the correct team and asked me what I wanted them to do!?!.

Eventually managed to cancel the order after submitting another complaint and ringing around their call centres. Was passed from pillar to post and spoke to 3 different staff members before someone actually cancelled the order.
If you are thinking of taking out a broadband package with Virgin take my advice and look elsewhere. I've never dealt with such an incompetent and unprofessional company who blatantly lie to you. They use delay tactics when you try and contact them, such as sending you around various departments, putting you on hold numerous times during the call for no reason whatsoever, and even disconnecting your call to deter you from proceeding any further. AVOID AT ALL COSTS",0

Okay, I should check the CC bill more regularly but if I buy a one month pass I expect it to last one month, not to roll on like a contract. Any reference to it auto renewing certainly wasn't clear in the initial purchase process as I would not have opted for that. Also, they happily take money each month but don't email a receipt. Trying to contact them isn't easy either. The Now TV live chat cuts off after a few minutes and emails while answered quickly are less than helpful.",0

no contact number to sort out the problem, used the online chat, which is not available full time, to be told they will launch an investigation with the warehouse which could take up to 48 hours it took 3 days before i heard from them at which point they said to return the wrong item and reorder the element.

"Firstly, I should like to praise the patient, courteous BT staff who have tried to help me upgrade my broadband package, against all odds. Thanks guys. How depressing that they have to work for a company whose lamentable administration, appalling inefficiencies and overall corporate indifference toward its customers is quite so utterly breathtaking (not to mention the worst 'hold-on' music to which i have ever been subjected). New package should have been implemented three weeks ago. Promised on two occasions. Failed on both. Still waiting.
Latest Update: Apparently, there are 'issues' between BT and Open Reach that can only be resolved with a Bridge Case (me neither). Then the order will have to be reissued (for the third time). Utter shambles!

Hi Neil. Thanks for your response. A data mismatch was apparently the problem the first time around. Plus ca change. As a neanderthal without access to either Twitter or Facebook, I guess I'm stuffed. How about you keeping me in touch (customer service?). BT has my number.

March 8 Update: BT have failed for the third time to implement the new package, despite assurances that it would be in place by today. Give me strength!",0
"How does this company get away with treating its customers so badly? They have left a 94-year-old lady with no telephone hence no access to her emergency response company via her pendant that requires a telephone line to work.
I have telephoned their customer support line repeatedly over the last week only to be fobbed off with excuse after excuse. Received text messages saying an engineer had called and carried out work that was a lie. Also promised that the telephone line would be up and running within 24 hours another big fat lie.
I tried to raise a complaint and was told that they had a bucket list that they needed to go through first before I could speak to a manager to raise a complaint. What the hell is that the only bucket I need is because Talk Talk is making me sick!!!.
I requested a call from the manager and was told someone would call me and guess what no one did.
I have spent hours on the phone and live chatting to incompetent talk talk staff who are utterly useless.

"The true merit of any company is how they deal with issues when things go wrong and judging by others recent feedback, I'm not alone in saying they are playing a dangerous game of overcharging us and their staff telling lies when questioned about this and also about the processing time for a refund.

In my case, they took ¬£400 more than they should have and it has yet to be refunded despite the customer rep saying it will take five working days (Tues, Weds, Thurs, Fri, Mon - today; that's five working days), it's overdue now and they will no doubt make up some other lie to keep hold of money that isn't theirs.

I've taken it up with my bank as I can't trust anything CPW will tell me anymore.",0
"The worse company ever.

Overpriced, constant issue with broadband connection. Finally left to go to community fiber (who are excellent).

I thought I had seen the end of them and yet they continue to charge me on a direct debit (despite leaving months ago) and a fee for not returning the box (which i did and had a receipt for doing).",0
Three signal is awfull. I have been using it for more than one year just because calcellation is impossible!!! There is usually a lack of network all around London particularly in central London. The data is also terrible! I always use wifi either at home or work because Three data is useless! Never have data!!! They don't let you cancell your contract and you have to pay a lot of money for no service!,0
"would give it a 5 Stars but Last week Nov 2021 I called BT customer support. When he answered I informed him that that twice I had asked for a returns label for a router they sent me as a replacement. I said I am recording this call as at least evidence I have called them twice and proof I have done more than my part kept on hold for 1 hr . The BT rep said he could no longer help me because I was recording the call. I said ""so its ok for BT to record the calls but not for me to record the calls?"". He said yes. So I told him I would post his recording on Youtube for all to hear. Strange since all I wanted to do is to be honest was to be upfront that I was recording and I do it for all calls by default for all my calls . He said it was BT policy to put the phone down on anyone who informs BT customer support they are recording the call. LOL . So now its all over the world with solid proof how appalling BT customer service actually is. Quite an unprofessional policy to have and with the extremely arrogant tone he had, I was very polite but quite shocked at his attitude but maybe he was having a bad day . not surprising with the quantity of negative comments on Trustpilot but I have found the actual Broadband service to be quite ok, other than a bizzar BT policy on customer recording a phone call . sadly I cannot post my YT link here. So If BT would like their router then contact me",0
Voda phone customer service is really really bad and 4g is really bad too much slow and sometimes didn‚Äôt even work,0
"Netflix is alot better then this! Shame really but there is way more films to choose from on Netflix than now tv, most of the films are pretty old, also half of the horror films literally make no sense like they shouldn't even be aloud to have them on now tv as there so bad!! Will not pay for this again.",0
"I don't think I'll ever understand why they've put ads on a subscription that people pay for. None of the other streaming apps have this apart from nowtv and let's be honest it's all so they can make a little money which to be honest is shocking given how much they charge for each different service they have. I've gotten to my wits end with the app especially with how much it plays up I always check my internet is running ok and also will kick start other apps just to check how they are running also. I've lost count to how many times I start the app up and it's just a blank screen and have to repeatedly close the app and end up giving up entirely on even watching anything on it, I've used it on my PS4, my firestick and my tablet and all seem to have issues just different ones so I've given up and will no longer subscribe to such a buggy app with and breaks every 20 mins when streaming shows that aren't even live TV.",0
Ordered a fridge freezer via Curry‚Äôs online. Agreed delivery date. Never booked in. Left to me to find out no delivery and had to rebook days later. No effort to resolve the problem. Rude and indifferent customer service.,0
"Ordered item on 23rd November. Posted on the 26th. Lost by Evri on the 27th. Messaged on the 4th, 5th, 8th December. Told an investigation takes 30 days via email. Then told in another email that a different item (that was delivered a couple months ago) was being investigated. Like what? I plainly stated the item, the date purchased, the price. Why are you investigating a completely different item?! What is going on? Is this company going bust? The disorganisation is mind blowing. I want a refund credit on my account for the ¬£35 quilt that was lost. I recommend anyone attempting to order from studio right now. Just don‚Äôt. Not until this disorganised mess is sorted by someone who knows what they‚Äôre doing.",0
"Where do I start? We bought a tv from curry's and decided it would be a good idea to have it fixed to the wall so we bought the recommended bracket and booked team knowhow at ¬£125 to come and do the work. Before I go on can I just make this rant very clear, the team at curry's Oldham were fantastic
That's the good news, it goes downhill fast from there.
A week after purchasing our tv team knowhow turned as scheduled, nice guys. So after realizing they did not have the correct fixing for the bracket they asked us if we had some screws!!! The bracket was fixed to the wall and tv hung. They left us to clear up all the mess from the drilling and left.
Upon sitting down to see our lovely new tv in pride of place on the wall it appeared not to be straight and confirmed this when I put a spirit level on it. I phoned the guys and told them to which they said they would call me back in 10 mins and arrange to come straight back. No phone call, no sign off them and they ignored my calls after that.
I called team knowhow to inform them and was told another appointment would have to be done. So another 7 days later another team turned up. Upon inspecting they agreed the tv was not straight however as the 1st team took all the spares which came with the bracket they informed us that we needed to another bracket and until we had it they could not do anything and left.
Yet another call to team knowhow and yet another appointment again 7 days later. The team again turned up and the first thing I was asked was ""what are we here to do?"" When I told them they answer was ""we are not trained to hang TV's.can you imagine our response and subsequent phone call to team knowhow.
So another appointment was made and again it was for a further 7 days. 7 days past and I get a call from the team booked to rectify the work. Again I got asked what they were coming to do. After explaining this long story they informed me they were also not trained for this. The situation is now that bad it is laughable.
So another call to team knowhow, all we got was apologies and the promise of a full refund of the ¬£125 install fee and the cost of the original bracket. Another appointment was made this time 3 days. We were told to call back as soon as the problem was fixed and we were happy. The team came and rectified the problem and finally we were happy.
So we phoned back as instructed, again having to explain the whole story to which came the response they wouldn't be giving a full refund and were only giving ¬£30 towards the bracket.
Fuming with nothing we could say they ended the call.
Team knowhow, you mean team know nothing! These are supposed to be experts the customer relations team is a joke this is by far the worst service we have received from any company ever!",0
"Currys charged me twice for one item
Instead of 159 pounds I saw in my bank statement I charged twice 159 pounds, they refunded but not single apologise",0
"Terrible service from start to finish.
Installation was poor and very untidy.
Broadband and TV service intermittent, often having to turn the system off and reset. On internet speed test would only achieve 60mps out of the 350mps quoted. At the end of contract term the cost almost doubled and the previous rate was only available to new customers. Customer service is very poor and take ages to get to speak to someone that can help. It has take over two months to cancel my contract, hundreds of phone calls, a number of letters and hours on the chat system. I can not stress how much I would avoid this company at all cost. There are far better options.
To Virgin Media,
Your business model of proving a discounted service to new customers, thinking they will be will be happy to pay more after using it is deluded.
Provide an easy cancelation process, online or in the app. It will reduce your labour cost dramatically.",0

Absolutely shocking untrained puppets in an Indian Call centre and when you have an issue they are more interested trying to get more money.

Avoid Guys. 3 is useless.",0
"I'd give no stars if possible. Ordered a silver iPhone X, received a rose gold one. Battery failure after 6 weeks use.

Phone returned 3 weeks ago to replace the battery as phone has a 12 month warranty. Still waiting. How long does it take to replace a faulty battery?

Shocking customer services as my chasing emails are ignored and I've sent several. There's no phone number available to contact them. Can't think why!

Absolutely disgraceful level of service. All I want is a battery replacement.

Maybe this week they may have the courtesy to update me & better still return my property ie a phone with a working battery......

Please think twice before you purchase.

Having received a reply on trust pilot on 8.9.20, it would be equally as good if customer services could reply to my many emails sent over the last weeks rather than publicly suggest they will assist!",0
They are scam my husband. He didn't use Vodafon mobile for 3 years and they were taking money regularly. They didn't cancel contact when he phoned them up and as soon as hi stopped direct debit they contacted third party to collect money. Ridiculous. Never will recommend this company to anyone,0

Example: episodes won't continue onto the next one.

I declined the offer and my phone was returned to me; I checked the screen and it was perfect. I sent it off to UR who have stated it is good and have offered the full quoted price. I feel that envirofone tried to rip me off and I am ¬£100 better off with the UR offer. I advise people to thoroughly check your screen prior to sending it off and don't accept the first offer if it's ridiculous.",0
"I have been a customer of Virgin Media Broadband/TV/Landline for 3 and a half years. For some reason, I have to end the contract and let them know. They have charged me and said the deactivation is on the 15th of January. I have confirmed this information over the phone twice and with a chat conversation (I have even screenshots) the broadband will be cut off on the 15th of January and I paid the last extra bill. Then they deactivated the broadband on the 24th of December which is Christmas Eve!!! I called them and spent 2 hours on the phone, services checked and then they asked me to pay extra if I want internet till the end of the contract. this is absolutely a punishment due to leaving Virgin Media. Even though I paid this month's bill they cut the broadband off earlier than they promised which I have proof of.
WORST Customer experience ever!
If there is a chance I would even rate it ZERO!",0
"Received email confiming payment made - ""Your cash will arrive in your account today!""
Five days later, still nothing in my account, so send message to customer service, who nicely tell me ""Unfortunately, we cannot see that the payment has bounced, so we request that you send us a copy of your bank statement [cut] to include the account number and sort code as well as payment amounts and payment dates however, you may redact any other personal information. Once we receive this, we will pass it on to a member of our accounts team to investigate further.""
Nice. Not going to investigate until I can prove I haven't received the money?!
I've asked for a transaction reference number for the payment, but they have not responded. So for this, no stars.
Update 21/12: finally, (today) I have been told that the payment bounced due to an error in the details. It's a shame I can't actually see if the bank details are correct, because the website stars most of it out even though I have to log in twice to get there. Still no transaction reference number, but maybe I'll actually get the payment ""in the next few days.""",0

I signed up to Vodafone FTTP super fast broadband and it‚Äôs its been nothing but trouble.

I had no router sent out and had no router on my installation date. I kept getting false promises that the router is on its way. And was without internet. After days of waiting for the router and finally the router arrived the service did not work.

After endless calls and web chats to Vodafone for hours and hours for days and being pass from one department to another they finally managed to get service‚Ä¶. But it didn‚Äôt last long, within hours the connection kept dropping, the speed kept dropping and once now once again no service again and without internet.

"As GHD don't seem to reply to their negative reviews on here, I'm not holding my breath for a resolution, but I want to warn other buyers to steer clear.

I travel frequently for work and have lived in three different countries. The GHD I bought in NZ didn't work when I moved to America (All my other electrical appliances did when using the adapter)

I then bought another GHD in America which didn't work when I moved to the UK.

Contacted GHD's customer service multiple times and never heard anything back. When I buy a premium product I expect a premium customer service to resolve any faults in the product.

I was recommended a GHD or Parlux hairdryer by my hairdresser recently and went for a Parlux instead, not wanting to waste another penny with GHD, they lost a once loyal customer.",0

"I have been waiting for BT to put in my full fibre for three months. The day had finally arrived. Open Reach turned up only to tell me that they could not drill a hole through plaster to put the wire in.
I thought it was April Fool.
This company is just shocking. I then had to wait 25 minutes to phone up and question what Open Reach can and cant do.
Open Reach are cowboys and will come up with any excuse NOT to do the work.
I have now revbooked for another 2 weeks and apparently have to drill the hole myself.
I wonder then if they will come up with another excuse, for example the wire is too long or we cant stand on ladders.
It's like the saying
It takes three men to change a lightbulb,.one to hold the ladder, one to make the tea and one to actually change it.

It is now Saturday, still no phone, Yodel says it's with them and was supposed to be delivered today. Spoken to Argos again to be told they will contact Yodel but again will have to wait until tomorrow for any response, if I have one! Asked about cancelling the order but was told they will not issue a refund until they have the phone returned to them by Yodel and then it could take up to 5 working days! So I am without a phone, nobody seems to know where it is or when I'll have it and out of pocket to the tune of ¬£749! Thanks Argos!",0

"Ordered an upgrade a month ago. I was too late to pick up the order instore by a couple of hours. Vodafone supposedly cancelled the order but, a week later, the order was still in 'open' status. I contacted customer support and they put in another cancellation request. They told me it would be 48 hours. Five days later, the order was still 'open'. I contacted customer support and they put in another request. Again, 48 hours later it had still not been cancelled. So I repeated the process. Now, 3 days after the last cancellation request and a month after the upgrade was first ordered, I contacted Vodafone again.

They told me the store had not returned the device to the warehouse and they must return it before my order could be cancelled. They told ME to contact the store. I contacted the store on a number they had contacted me on before, which turned out to be a member of staff's personal mobile number. He said he could not do anything as they do not have the device.

So here I am. Vodafone has my money which I paid for the upgrade with and it has been a month and I've not recieved my device. I have no idea what to do as I cannot place a new order to upgrade and it seems impossible to cancel my previous order which I never collected. I am very stressed about all of this. I have been a long term Vodafone customer and do not want to leave but this experience might force me to change my mind. It should not be my job to go between store and office to sort out a cancellation.",0

despite Mazuma's excuse of a reply, the same iPad was sent to another company who passed it as perfect and paid me the fair amount.

Monday I was told the complaints team Don't work weekends,

For 3 months I've had to repeatidily explain the grounds of my complaint, each time being told im wrong, they told me I did contact them but never made a payment.... Even though I had shown proof several times...

Now my bank have confirmed that you did process my payment on that day... I sent you this evidence... No response...

We brought a washing machine a d tumble dryer from currys both Hoover about 14 month ago. The tumble dryer lasted all of 12 months but we was ok because we had a what happens if repair plan it took over 3 weeks to replace it so not the 7 days on my repair plan but at least I could change the machine from Hoover to Bosh and it works really well. Now for part 2 of my story. 3 weeks ago the Hoover washing machine broke down the padals come of the Inside of the drum . So I phoned currys no problem we will send someone to repair it 7 days later repair man come and replaced pedals next day washing machine making a strange noise called currys no problem send someone back out 7 days later o a screws was left in side the drum !!!! Next day today the pedals have fallen of again now have to wait another 7 days to be looked at 7 days for parts 7 days to say it's no good and 7 days to get a new one it's all 7 days only problem is it should only take 7 days to replace in stead of 28 days I think the moral of the story is don't have Hoover it's just cheep don't go to currys it's just cheep and poor service . Instant Replacement !!!!!!! instant repair !!!!!!! That what we was told BUT READING THE SMALL PRINT says something different will never go to currys again",0

During the pandemic when I took a pay cut as they removed the nightshift and vodafone were saying ""they were there to help"" for people struggling due to the pandemic and to get in touch yet when I phoned them all they were more interested in was selling me a new contract which would of added to the debt. In fact they helped me get a negative mark on my credit file for an arrangement to pay. Further more their customer service staff are bullies, they manipulate the situation and if you let your guard down they will write new charges on to your bill.

I still lost a day's pay because I couldn't work as a result of the sh.. WIFI, kept dropping out. Could have easily lost my job. And no, the 'why don't you just go back to the office' rhetoric won't fly. It's amazing how much bs is being normalized in this country.",0
"What a shambles, no one knows what is going on. Opened up an account with them but it didn‚Äôt get turned on, phoned up they said account was lost and had to start again. A new date, day before got text saying they were phoning, which they did but didn‚Äôt speak. Got a text to say we missed phone call and they are putting internet on, on a later date. So we phoned and they didn‚Äôt know why. Was lots more to this story, but so cheesed off can‚Äôt be bothered to tell it. Wouldn‚Äôt touch with a barge pole.",0
"You have ¬£500and two active credit checks that we passed, but you cancelled both our orders 12 hours after confirming they were successful. An hour before cancelling one of your CS reps said everything was fine on the phone. Absolutely disgusted and tonight nobody can give me a straight anseer about how or when the credit checks will be removed and we have to wait five days for ¬£500 to be refunded during cost of living crisis. Sickening

Order MPD103549427 and MPD103549197

We have confirmed hard credit searches on both our accounts just days before trying to confirm a mortgage. Your manager who has been due to call has not rung for two days, and your CS rep suggested we need to phone 3 to get credit searches removed. On top of this you have delivered phones and sims to people who ordered half a day later than us. There is absolutely no goodwill or attempt to sort this, the promised call from a manager hasn't happened and we have laughingly been told by your reps to order again despite the credit searches expeiran and trans Union have confirmed exist. How can it be that we are short of money, have hard searches against us and your CS reps have advised we need to sort the problem directly with 3, a company we have never ever spoken to. The lack of attempt to even match the deal or get close to it is a disgrace.",0
"No professionalism, no respect to customers time, waited for 2 hours for my food but the food wasn‚Äôt delivered and they couldn‚Äôt process any refund too, never use deliveroo plus, total waste of money, kept me on hold for 30 mins when requested to speak with a manager",0
I wish I can give no star at all! Twice their driver messed up but the company customer service wouldn‚Äôt do anything about it! Isn‚Äôt the driver employee of the company? So I don‚Äôt understand if their driver screwed up why is not their responsibility to fix it. The driver left the food somewhere on the street and left. At the end we couldn‚Äôt even find the food the driver didn‚Äôt reply or picked up the call! We can‚Äôt get refund or no resolution whatsoever. Never using them again. They just apologies and ended the issue! Justeat app has always been so helpful unless Deliveroo. Calling themselves support line when they can‚Äôt even help with anything!,0
"Worst broadband ever. I would not recommend vodafone, their customer service is terrible.

"been waiting over 12 weeks for broadband service. has been connected 3 times and then within 48 hours it gets cancelled.

"Terrible Experience. Moved into my property 11 years ago and got 55mb down, Each year the speed has got slower but the price of the contract has gone up. Now I am lucky to get 30mb down but pay 3x the cost of my original contract while my connection drops up to 8 - 10 times a day while working from home. Customer service state it‚Äôs slower because of more activations in the area but I think this is just a scripted response. When the ‚ÄúEngineers‚Äù come out it‚Äôs the usual story ‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt much I can do‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs the WiFi‚Äù ‚Ä¶ All my devices are connected over LAN Cable. The website literally Scams you into your next contract by saying it‚Äôs an ‚ÄúOffer‚Äù even when it‚Äôs ¬£10 more a month for less speed. The only thing you can do is call them and negotiate to stay close to the existing price. The whole experience is like nails on a chalk board. Will be leaving BT at the earliest opportunity, 11 years of this has tilted me off the face of the planet.",0
"We tried to bring our Hub along with us when we moved house and setup a new package, but it was cancelled on us twice, both times with no reason given, even after the engineer had installed it and got it up and running. The customer service team don't offer any insight into what the actual issue is and seem to make things up to avoid blame. I'm waiting on the third attempt to be setup more than a month after it was initially planned. Avoid them they're awful, it's worth spending more to avoid this terrible service.",0
"Went to connect with Virgin broadband today for the first time, told there is an outage in my area - will be fixed by late afternoon.

This has just been a huge waste of time.",0
"I didn't get my order. Supposedly rider could not find my address, terreced house. No phone calls no, any other contact, they just stollen my money",0
"After I cancelled my BT service when I moved house, I received an email asking me to return my BT box in the bag provided. I never received a bag (presumably they sent it to my old address). And so began a three-month dystopian nightmare.

I called three or four times to ask them to send the bag, was promised each time that they would, but they never arrived. Next, I was told I could take the box to any EE store. After traipsing all around London to EE stores to try and hand my box in, it turns out they're not taking them due to Covid and I had been given duff info by BT and wasted my time and effort.

Then I started getting the emails demanding I pay ¬£115 for the box and the threat of debt collection agencies. After several more calls, a woman I spoke to said she would mark the box as returned, I would get an email confirming this within 24 hours and that would be the end of the matter.

Guess what? I never got that email, just another threatening email demanding ¬£115. I called again and was told it was impossible to mark the box as returned without returning it so the previous woman was either lying or just incompetent.

I asked if they could send a courier to collect it and was told this was absolutely impossible. Raised a complaint and when the person rang me about my complaint, guess what - there is a specific ParcelForce service BT use for just this kind of scenario.

So why did someone not tell me that in the first place?? All in all, over three months I think I must have had to call BT about 12 times to try and return this box, each time having to go over the whole story again.

The worst thing was, no-one I spoke to showed the slightest bit of sympathy for the inconvenience I had been caused, and didn't even seem surprised by my story, like it was a totally normal thing.

My overall impression is that BT is a massive, faceless corporation where the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing, there's no consistency at all in what you're told by their staff and basically they couldn't give two hoots about their customers.",0
"Since no one has mentioned speeds and everyone has been speaking about wi-fi cutting out.

I haven't had any issue with the wi-fi dropping, however I have got the Fibre 1 broadband deal which states I would normally have 24-45mbps download speed and 6-8mbps upload speed.

Had an engineer come over to ""improve"" the speed and all that happened in the next 2 days was my download speed dropping down to 3mbps and my upload down to 0.7mbps.

When I asked them to do something about it, the technician team simply replied that upload speed cannot be guaranteed and ""one only needs it if he works at a space station"" which makes me think that they do not have the required knowledge to carry out a job in the technician team department.

Awful experience so far.",0

Ordered a Christmas present for our little girl at on the 22nd of November, should have been delivered by the 30th of November.

We were assured it would be delivered and that the courier have the item to deliver it when we spoke to them on Friday, today its been cancelled 1 WEEK BEFORE CHRISTMAS! Absolutely shocking customer service too, told us to just reorder it and it would be delivered before christmas! (1. It takes up to 10 days to be dispatched by the manufacturer 2.

Called to get a refund and cancel my line as unhappy and they told me if I cancel my line they will not refund me. Further to this, they cannot send an engineer out to reconnect for two more weeks and I cannot request a refund for two weeks after that. Such poor business practice as they have trapped me into continuing business with them. I feel bad for their poorly paid call centre employees who have to have these discussions with upset customers over the phone when they clearly don't agree with the company policies either and their management team just don't care. There is literally no point complaining either as you will get no where.",0

Dont waste your time or effort in this company. Staff told me on a daily basis the phone will be delivered within the next 24 hours and it has never arrived!",0
"Just Awful! The worst we have ever had!
From the start our internet was poor and when my husband rang to cancel they somehow convinced him to buy a bigger faster, and more expensive package! It‚Äôs even worse now!!

The wifi is so poor my data is all used after two weeks on my phone as it‚Äôs constantly on 4g. I live in the city and supposedly have full speed?! It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt believe you it‚Äôs not working?! They sent an engineer out once and it worked fine til he left then went off again!

I also asked to be put through to the complaints department, and she told me that they didn't have one.

The fourth person cut me off. I couldn't be bothered being made to go through all that hassle again so I didn't phone back.

Returned to Nantwich, manager not interested.

Purchased a different machine, had to be ordered in. When in, collected all looked okay, but once home discovered some burnt on food on the plates !!!
Manager again not interested again, he said not his fault as came from warehouse. He did say both machines had previously been returned from Chester shop.
Are they selling second hand goods now!!
I hope the management at Argos read my review and come back to me, about how they think selling dirty returned goods to customers, not once but twice, is acceptable and good for business. Truly disgusting experience.

"Have not had a good experience with Carphone Warehouse at all. Their customer service system is completely broken.

I ordered a phone online two and a half weeks ago. Was giving them the benefit of the doubt re a longer than expected delivery time. After two weeks I contacted them by email. No update after 24 hours so I called the delivery service myself who claim they never received the package.

I try to call Carphone and then enter into customer service hell. Over multiple calls I've been told a variety of things ranging from:

-I'll have to go in store to resolve the issue as they can't help with online sales (I called the number at the bottom of my receipt for the item I purchased online). This sounded like very poor advice. I called my local carphone warehouse to confirm this (they were very nice) but confirmed they can't help with online sales

-this is the number for .co.uk issues only (again the number I was given and used for around 4 other fruitless calls)

-they can't find my order and I can't have ordered from them. I have two emails and money that came out of my bank.

- they can't help but have another number for me to ring (the number does not exist when dialled)

Concurrently I have been trying to figure out where my ‚Ç¨500 package is by their customer service via email. Each time I have been told they're following up with the delivery company. I only get a response after sending multiple emails.

I have now asked for a refund and have been told I cannot get one until the delivery company has confirmed the loss of a package they claim they never received.

And so it seems I shall be forever consigned to going round in circles.",0

Yes where possible a bill should be paid on time but to restrict a service after 10 days is disgusting given the current climate most people find themselves in, but this is probably the point as a lot of people are working from home there broadband is now a essential service so a quick restriction by BT means a payment will be forthcoming, cynical.",0

"After my phone broke I took it in to Carphone Warehouse to claim on my insurance. After having paid ¬£15 per month and then ¬£70 excess I was expecting a good service. My phone is white, and they did not have this colour in stock and advised I would have to choose another colour. I asked if I could wait for them to contact me when it came into stock, but they rudely advised me that this was not possible. The assistant in Carphone Warehouse spoke to them and advised that he had a white model in stock that they could give me, but TeamKnowhow said that they it is their policy to never replace phones with new ones, only old refurbished ones. I then suggested that I could purchase another model in white from them and would be prepared to pay a higher price, but they advised this would not be possible either.

After paying ¬£15 a month and ¬£70 excess, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to expect to receive the same phone as I currently have. The assistant at Carphone Warehouse advised that I take this higher as this was the third time in two days that he‚Äôd experienced such problems with TeamKnowhow not stocking the correct replacements, and said it was embarrassing to have to represent them.

After explaining the issue to several people they advised there was nothing they could do, and I would have to keep coming into Carphone Warehouse to check when they had my phone to replace in stock.

TeamKnowhow is over priced, incompetent and rude. I will be cancelling my policy once the issue is resolved, and I would advise anyone not to use them.",0

"Unbelievably poor service
I previously wrote a review about this company more than 8 weeks ago and have still had no resolution
My understanding is that three cases have been raised for the same issue to which my understanding is that 2 of them have been closed in which they appear to claim it has been resolved to which we certainly do not agree has been resolved
As for the third case I am not sure what the situation is.
The last phone call I made I had just had enough. After over 20 years with this company we felt like we had been treated appalling. We also feel that as we have got some time to go on our contract they were not interested in doing anything to resolve our concerns as we were tied into a contract with them
That has made us definitely want to leave Virgin Media
We had previously requested to leave and to waiver any fees in view of what we feel was poor service and I believe it was at the time about ¬£80 fee
Before Christmas I phoned again opting for the department to discuss leaving so I could find out what the exit fees are now.
After spending a considerable amount of time discussing this to someone I believed was in the department that dealt with leaving I was told that I would have to be put through to another department who dealt with leaving then spent another considerable amount of time discussing this and asked what the cancellation fee was at this point in time, I must‚Äôve asked 10 times, each time with no answer and instead talked of something else and he then said he would end the contract when I asked him what I mean he would end the contract. He said he would need to end it in order to see what the fees were! I told him I hadn‚Äôt asked him to end the contract yet I wanted to know what the fees were to end the contract.
I couldn‚Äôt believe it
This point in time I‚Äôve been on the phone for one hour and 20 minutes and I‚Äôve got absolutely nowhere and then he wanted to put me through to another department to reopen the case that I‚Äôve been ongoing for over eight weeks and which they‚Äôve done nothing about. This was an absolute joke. I absolutely dismay of this company I‚Äôve been going round in circles, banging my head against the wall with this company and to say there is a communications company!
Further to your response it appears you have tried to justify Virgin Media‚Äôs actions!!!
It is Virgin Media that have raised and closed these cases without resolution and without consultation to us. No one has tried to contact us to discuss it with us.
AND it is Virgin Media that have created these issues !!!
We even asked to speak to a Manager because we were unable to get satisfactory responses from your agents and that did not happen either.
The issue we had initially was with Virgin Media was our internet going off whilst improvements were being made which we were not notified about. Only when it actually happened did we find out that it was expected to be off all day and this is not the first time this has happened. We were then told we could have additional features added to our package for the same price we are currently paying then we were told we couldn‚Äôt?
Finally it was one of your agents who told us that we would have to be disconnected to find out what the disconnection fee was?
I believe this would indicate who are the ones that are confused YOUR AGENTS either that or they don‚Äôt appear to know what they are doing.
Why on earth would we want to subject ourselves to phoning and speaking to any of your agents again if this is what we have to contend with?
It is all very well responding to my review which I felt the need to resort to, because I wasn‚Äôt getting a satisfactory response when actually phoning Virgin Media
We shouldn‚Äôt have to
Perhaps you should focus on ensuring that your agents are trained to an adequate standard to resolve customer issues and not close cases that are not resolved satisfactorily.
At the end of the day we had issues with our service which should have been addressed easily, promptly and professionally. Instead it has dragged on for more than 8 weeks without resolution on our part, being told we could have additional features added to our package at no additional cost then had that rescinded, been subjected to hours of frustration on the phone.
Is this really a service that you find appropriate to give to your customers?",0
"No cooling of membership period.
Oh goodness, if you thought Bt was bad wait until you get this.
I signed for a membership I tried to use to see how good it was but wasn‚Äôt any good to me.
After 30 minutes of signing for the membership I decided to cancel the membership and they charge me for the full month.
Looks like this company does not offer a cooling period.

"Very reluctant to even be giving one star and not one to write reviews‚Ä¶

I was talked around to switch my current provider to BT back in December, promising that any cancellation charges would be covered by BT.
The initial installation was fine, if not a long months wait, however, after discovering that the BT TV also included having an arial fitted at an extra cost and with extra waiting time, I did not find the effort worth it. Upon speaking to a member of staff from BT, it was only then that I was notified that the cancellation charges (up to ¬£300) will only be credited onto my account, and can be done ‚Äòvery simply‚Äô via email. After expressing my frustrations that in no way was this explained in the first instance, I requested to speak to a manager and was promised a call back. After not hearing anything for 3 days, I called back with another promise of a call, only when they did, I was told that nothing was able to be done and a mere ¬£16 would be credited on to my account. I do not have the funds to pay outright for a cancellation fee, which is currently causing a high amount of stress, but this has, very rudely, not been considered whatsoever.
Reluctantly, I sent BT my termination charges from my old provider via the email address provided. I have sent the amount of 7 emails to this service in the last 3 days with no avail, being told the same useless information each time. The communication between emails is absurd, with no evidence that anyone on their team are capable of assisting or carrying out a simple task, and still to this point have not had a resolution. I was told via this email chain, that I could discuss this via a number provided, which after calling said number, I was told they could not assist with the switch.
I honestly, wish I had never ever considered BT as an option and feel that so much angst and stress has been caused in the last 3 months that I highly advise anyone to avoid anything to do with BT!!",0

They just refused to accept it and I had to basically force them to do it. Not even convinced it will happen.

Even the website doesn't let you leave without agreeing to. I get upselling and retention is a big thing but christ it's just such hard work and the deals are pathetic.

Carphone warehouse sold me a phone contract with an iPhone XR in March 2019 on O2. As reported by O2 and Apple there was software issues with the phone and O2 so for 6 Months+ I was not able to use the data properly as it kept cutting out. Carphone warehouse kept passing me around and finally took the phone in for repair after more than 6 months. Shops and Customer service field to provide suitable compensation for the lost use of my phone and delaying the fix. I was still paying ¬£50+ a month for the phone which I could not use fully and felt I should be due a small refund to compensate the additional I had to pay when I could not use the phone. Now they do not reply to my emails. They are useless and will never use again. Rubbish customer service as they send template answers and each email is from someone different so you have to keep explaining the problem.,0
"Kristen Bodnar of Kiki's Cleaning took total advantage of me and my situation. I am a profoundly depressed individual with mobility issues. She not only quoted $280 for 6hours. She was going to clean the really messed up floors but also dust, wash the sink and counters, do the bathroom and the bedroom but also do the hanging of clothes and some other organizing. She did a passable job on the floors with many breaks, she moved piles from one place to the other. She did a little work in the bathroom. But never dusted. Not only did she not clean the kitchen, but she left a bigger mess in the sink. Than she wanted much more money and she wanted to fight about it. Because my landlord is paying for her services out of my account, they don't want to get involved in a whole thing, they have told me that they will pay what they are invoiced for.

"Ordered American fridge freezer for delivery and install, and recycle of old one, advised them on arrival doors would have to come off both, I had already disconnected the old one for them, instead of removing doors they started to try and smash the handles off in my living room close to my PC and TV I advised that they could of just unscrewed them which I then had to loan them a screwdriver but as now bent was no good to unscrew so they gave in and took doors off but I had to also had to get a ladder for them to use, they then brought new one in but rather then raise casters and use the wheels the fridge was dragged over my brand new kitchen floor leaving engraved scratch marks in floor, caster looked like fridge had been dragged outside as damaged and covered in mud as well, also had mud from there shoes throughout my ground floor and also had dog mess left in house which one of them must of trodden in, understand some dirt from shoes can happen but they did not even think to say sorry, 2 of them asked to use loo in house, only one took shoes off so had mud left upstairs as well. The new fridge they then put in kitchen and about to leave when noticed it was damaged, doors also put on poorly - they offered 15% off but I refused this and asked for a non damaged one to be re- delivered, they arranged this for couple days time on Saturday 28th, Had call Saturday morning from Currys service team who said about doing a service call on Kenwood fridge I explained that I was expecting a replacement Samsung Fridge freezer of which they said sorry have no record of that and they would call me back, 2hrs passed no call back so had to leave job and head back from London to the Guildford store, Got told that fridge I had ordered could not be replaced as out of stock until 10th Feb, they had another similar fridge in stock available for delivery next day but was more expensive and all they could do to compensate was offer 10% which considering all the hassle was poor they had already offered 15% off the damaged on if I had kept it so unsure why they could not offer 15% off this other model, they left me no choice as I could not get a refund and shop elsewhere as they could not refund me until they had collected the damaged one left in my house which they was unsure when this would be, AVOID shopping with Currys if you can... Customer service levels shocking - Was meant to have another fridge turn up today which they did turn up but could not deliver as delivery team not trained on using stair assist equipment and don't have it on lorry even though on their system it was down for a stair assit delivery as request by Currys I have now sent all info into Currys so will see how they resolve",0

"I've been a customer of VM for many years and never had any issues with them until it came to cancellation. I'd gotten a much better deal from BT (half the price for better services, VM couldn't match it) so wrote to them (per their instructions) to cancel my phone, tv and broadband packages in July last year. They acknowledged the letter and pencilled cancellation in for 3rd August. Long story short - they mucked up and only cancelled the phone, putting Broadband and TV onto a new contract. They then kept trying to charge me for these services and despite 3 discussions with their customer services and 2 complaints to them (which were closed off and ignored) they never got it sorted and then sent debt collectors after me in October/November. I ended up having to get ombudsman involved as they affected my credit rating (plummeted from excellent to poor) and would not respond to my communications about the situation. Even when ombudsman agreed with me and agreed a solution with VM to fix the issue they took over a month to sort it all out (Ombudsman gave them 20 working days- it took them 35 days to sort!). What did I get for all this stress and trouble . . a measly ¬£50 (still waiting for the cheque) which includes the ¬£40 refund I should have got when my services were cancelled. One of the worst customer experiences I have ever had, terrible handling of a customer complaint and very disappointing result for a customer that has been with them for 8+ years - never again!",0

"We have several accounts with Three and don‚Äôt often have the need to contact their Customer Support.

I am currently abroad and have over the years always taken our phones without any issues.

For some reason Three insist on their customers using a pin when recovering voicemail abroad despite going through the biometrics to open the phone.

At home in the UK I do not need a pin to recover voicemail.

When I arrived last week, I could not recall my pin. I went through the process of setting up a new one.

All worked well for a few days.

Today another call started coming in from a withheld number whilst I was on the phone. The caller left a voicemail. When I went to recover the message the system did not recognise my password as it did a few days ago.

The system would not let me set a new one.

Today over a 7 hour period I have spent more than 2.5 hours on the phone to the so called Three Customer Support. I spoke to 5 different people across 3 calls.

I was ultimately told that that you cannot change your voicemail password whilst being abroad despite being able to do so last week and on several occasions previously.

None of the previous 4 staff were able to tell me this and just sent me on a wild goose chase and waste hours of my time.

The 4th person I spoke to was in Customer Relations and he lacked any concept of what Customer Relations actually meant saying that I would have to wait for between 24 and 48 hours for a call back regardless of the urgency to drawer down the messages.

The final person I spoke to was one of their Managers in their Customer Relations Department and he was unable to explain why I could previously change my pin and not now and was equally incapable of explains why a pin was now compelled on voicemail abroad and not in the UK or by other providers.

The worst thing was that the manager was unwilling to arrange for a decision maker at Three to call me back and explain why this was the case or why I had to speak to so many staff and have so much of my day wasted on second rate customer service with no resolution.

For years Three have excelled in proving good service when taking your phone abroad. Since May they have started making a daily charge fir using your phone abroad and have additional reduced the level of service and support to their customers alongside.

Clearly Three have now dropped from the best phone company when using your phone abroad to the worst with Customer Service that shows nothing but contempt fir customers time.

On the downside of 2022 we have two contracts coming up for review and unfortunately we will be taking our business to a more caring provider.

For a Technology Company it seems that Three have gone backwards.

IF YOU ARE Q THREE CUSTOMER GOING ABROAD MY ADVICE IS TO PLACE A SIM FROM ANOTHER PROVIDER IN YOUR PHONE

"Made a purchase of a washing machine and arranged the delivery for the following week. An hour or so later I got an email telling me it would be delayed for4 a week due to my location.

"I placed an order by phone with someone who was mumbling. I did not receive a confirmation email so I phoned again, only to be told that phone orders do not and cannot receive a confirmation email because ""it is a verbal agreement"". Not sure what one has to do with the other. They will not send you an email confirmation even if you ask, which seems absurd to me. Now trying to cancel the order, which is proving almost impossible.
Ordering from them was a huge mistake. You cannot operate purely on a verbal basis if your call handlers mumble (which isn't their fault).
Are you seriously telling me a company of this size doesn't have the ability to send an email!?
I am now told my handset delivery will be delayed by a week, of which I was not notified. I have now managed to cancel my order, but was told there is no way for me to receive confirmation that I will receive a refund. Though apparently I can request a recording of the call. How is that better?
I can't believe any of this is legal and I have reported the company to trading standards.

"Absolutely awful experience with Shell Energy

First they repeatedly tried to increase Direct Debits to twice my average monthly usage. I questioned it, and they said they were using an industry standard algorithm. Err, no: an algorithm invariably takes parameters as function inputs to get to an output - so, presumably, the output should be a direct relation to the input, which is my energy usage amongst other things. Of course it has no relation to my usage whatsoever and I am reasonably certain that the 'industry standard' algorithm is not non-linear!

Secondly, IHD packed up. It happens, says Shell. I know it does I checked the complaints about the model and make of the IHD and they precede the date that Shell installed the damn thing.- so they knowingly and, I say, vexatiously, installed a faulty product. Shell do not know when (or if) the issue will be resolved. Not to worry they said, your smart meter is still communicating with us

Except, of course, it wasn't. No evidence at all of the dual tariff I'm on, so can't enter my meter readings - and back to the industry standard algorithm which estimates my usage. As I said, invariably twice the actual usage.

Even if I could enter my meter readings both the website and the app are asking for the meter readings since 1 Jan 1970. Hmmm, I think they might have a fault (Hint: 1 Jan 1970 is day one for many computer systems, and the day counter often resets itself to day one following a fault)

Tried to resolve this with online chat only to be disconnected after being 100 in the queue to 30 and an hour or so wait. I gave up after waiting nearly an hour on the phone.

I will be asking for my 41.06p/day standard charge back. Since they cannot provide the software, hardware or the wetware, what service are they providing? Billing only services?

As I am now collecting the data for them (meter readings) shouldn't they pay me for my service?

If you recall Shell don't own/operate the power stations nor the infrastructure to deliver electricity, so apart from an automated PDF invoice/bill which is only rarely actually available for download, really: what service?

Remember, this is a (supposedly) world class OGP company. So, it's not as if they are short of a few quid that they could use for investment for their customers.

In all honesty, I think the Netherlands were very fortunate indeed with offloading this company to London and are probably delighted that the Dutch Royal family affiliation is now gone

I can feel a strongly worded letter to Ofgem in the works...

"Hello,

I've contacted Vodafone numerous times this year as I could never log in to my account. The email address was not registered. Your colleagues kept telling me this was forwarded to your technical team department, but it was never resolved. So I was unable to see the bills. Although, I did request for the bills to be emailed to this address, and I was told it was set up. I have never been receiving the bills. Today I called again and the login issue was resolved. However, as I have never seen the bills, I could not see that they were in my personal name, although it was supposed to be in my company's name. As per our conversation and also the purchase order. Now, I will have problems with the HMRC because the bills were paid by the company, so the bills need to be in the name of the company, otherwise, this is not accepted by the HMRC. I asked your colleague today to change the Billing name to the company name, which he did, but this will only apply to my future bills. He said, as per your policy, it's not possible to change the billing name backward. I really need them to be in the company's name as I requested right from the beginning. I believe it was an error on your end, thus an exception to this policy should be granted. Can you help me sort this out, please?

Thank you!",0

I had to block 4 phone numbers, one in particular that would not stop calling me to the point where I couldn't actually even use my phone until I blocked the number. Why not just send an email with a quote on and leave contact details rather than harassing people who just wanted some information.",0

"Would not recommend to my enemies.
Ordered a phone repair along with secure packaging mid April. I had to chase for the packaging at the start of May. Another week passes and the packaging arrives, but no postage label as promised. More emails to get that sorted.
They had the phone from mid May until the 18th of June and did not repair the phone. They simply sent the phone back to me as damaged as it was. I had to chase them via email to get an explanation, which was that they couldn't order the part. They said a refund is normally processed within 2 weeks, but due to covid it'll be 4 weeks.
I ordered the part myself on ebay the same day and fixed the phone myself within a week at less than half the cost.
It's now the 1st of August and still no refund, they are now saying it will be another month before the refund is processed.
I wouldn't want to purchase packaging from this company again let alone another repair nor a new phone.
My recommendation is to go elsewhere.",0

"Horrendously bad. 4 weeks now of being fobbed off regarding our wifi connection, once you leave the room where the router is situated, its completely useless. Tried to cancel, they want a disconnectin fee. Told them i am cancelling direct debit, i will not be paying any charges as the broadband is the worst connection i have ever had.

"Used their 7-day free trial for movies during 2019, and it was good. So I thought I would try their free-trial entertainment package.

Took it out and despite getting an email, the website refuses to acknowledge I have one. When trying to fix the problem, I somehow to out an ¬£11.99 Cinema pass, as if I can afford that.

"I'll rejoice when they shut this store and and their customer care personel become Amazon delivery drivers so that they can experience what customer care.
My wife ordered and paid for a new phone, just a handset replacement not a new contract. She received an email stating that the the shop will send an email as soon as the handset could be collected. That should have been on the Friday the previous week.
No emails arrived and I attend the shop, and guess what... the phone is there..... but you cant have it because there is no note on the system. From the same emails they didn't send.

I offered my drivers licence - same address and surname, the bank card that paid for the item... to collect the item, but according to the so called manager they cant except it due to data protection???? Data protection is to secure and prevention of shar8ng data, not collection of an item that a delivery driver would have done at home with just a signature. Not going into a contract... just a collection with an order number / email, proof of ID and payment. And then they insist that the person that ordered it should collect it. ( which is not possible at the moment, due to work commitments my wife cant attended the shop during their opening hours for the next few days.)

And to place a cherry on the cake... my wife phoned their CC... they add a password on the order... and now it could be collected. ( they took someone phoning in.... who could be anyone... word over a physical person with legitimate ID) And when pressed why they didn't send the confirmation emails.... no answer again.

When asked for a refund rather than using their service their return policy is to wait 2 weeks for the refund.

Please safe yourself the agony of dealing with this company and go somewhere else.

Carephone Warehouse... please dont even try to contact me or to apologise, I will never do business with you again. There are much better companies I'll rather deal with.",0

"Hi Everyone!
I'm Hafeez. I has been using Three since 8 months. It has horrible and very very poor customer service. I has SIM only Contract with them. I have been chasing from 2 weeks for SIM usage, SIM Activation details and device blacklisted report. I have sent multiple emails to proofs@3mail I could get any response from them. Every Day I need to call many times and beg them to solve my problem but they never turn up. Every time they tell to wait for 24 or 48 hours. Even after waiting for time frame. They raise many complaints to compliance department. Which is no use at all. Every time they ask me to resolution. That also no use. They kept me many times on hold and after 20 mins they dropped call. It very ugly and horrible experience which I faced with three. I reccomend everyone not to buy any products and services from Three. They are fooling service users.

Thanks & Regards,
Hafeez",0
"I received my Samsung Galaxy a71 on the 01/03/2020 after 3 weeks the phone began to crash and turn off randomly so I contacted the Carphone warehouse and was put through to the sales team who told me that the customer support was closed and they they're unable to help with general enquires so I waited a few more days and tried to contact again and was told the same thing so I waited a few weeks, 5 to be exact, and they told me that because it was over 30 days old I could not get a refund or replacement and the repairs team was closed due to the current circumstances with COVID-19 So I could not get a repair either so I waited for the stores to open which was today (15/16/2020) nearly 3 months since the faults began. When I went to the store they were happy to refund me until they saw that I had previously contacted the Carphone warehouse and then they told me that the amount for the device cannot be refunded due to me previously contacting them but I can get a repair so I unhappily agreed as I felt pressured to do so. Later that day I contacted customer service once more to ask why the store could not refund me because I had contacted them previously on the phone and I was told that it was because it is older than 30 days old so I replied ""that didn't answer my question"" and I was told to f*** off and then they hung up, If anyone from Carphone warehouse reads this I hope that you understand the type of company you work for and that something can be done about this as I do not want to deal with this company anymore and after being sworn at I don't feel that the repair is an adequate option and would like to request a refund once again and never have to deal with this company again.",0

"Many BT staff require urgent re-training to fully understand their product range & to address the culture of contempt that is growing within BT. I sought advice on splitting the 2.4 & 5ghz bands on my new Smart Hub 2, having upgraded at huge cost to Full Fibre 900 . It became clear that none of the staff I contacted understood why split bands are important or how SH2 differed from the original SH.
Web chat 1: After an eternity I was eventually lied to in order to get rid of me. I was told that a different hub would be sent which supports FF900 & splits bands. As a little added mockery, I was advised there'd be no delivery charge. No such hub exists & therefore no such order was ever going to be placed.
Web chat 2. I was advised to contact the manufacturer of my TV, as it was their fault the TV couldn't be assigned to the faster 5ghz band! What has happened to this once great company. Tip: Ditch the obsession with sports & focus on world class phone, broadband & Customer services.
25/10/2021. How does your reply Paddy, address in anyway, the disgraceful Customer service I described? You have simply evidenced yet again, total contempt for Customers.",0
"Do not use this service, it is most definitely a scam. Purchased a Samsung S22 via iD mobile, trade-in offered through parent company Currys. On receiving the phone for trade in by post, Currys claim it is considered non-working due to 'screenburn which is invisible to the naked eye'. They revised their offer for trade in of my phone down to 20% of the original offer. The option to refuse this is there, and Currys say they will return your phone if this is the case at their cost. Therefore I refused the offer and Currys said they were returning my phone 2 weeks ago. I've heard nothing since: no phone and no payment. From reading other reviews, this seems commonplace.

It seems the standard approach is to claim 'screenburn' is an issue and reduce the amount being offered for trade in. I've contacted Currys but not heard back yet. I'll update if I do.",0

"First time I have ordered anything from this company and probably the last.. I live on the Scottish Mainland and chose Hughes because they had the product (A Fridge) in stock and the website allowed me to check and pick a specific delivery date for my postcode (ordered on the 21st Sept, Delivery on the 23rd Sept) they were quick to dispatch and send me the Invoice, tracking details and the premature request to review them.. anyway its the 29th today and with no sign of what I ordered and no progress with the online delivery tracking I contacted them for an update, only to be told ""Delivery to this postcode location can take an extra 10 working days, the local depot will contact you directly to arrange the day for delivery asap"" .. so by my reckoning it could be up to three weeks from order to delivery.. good job its not urgent!! -- I will update this review when the Delivery is made..",0

The only saving grace is the fact that 90% of the agents I have dealt with to resolve these issues have been polite, efficient and good at their job.

A further update. After the last complaint, they have not responded in two weeks and after raising this with another agent, the agent shut the chat with me! Terrible service.",0
"I agree with all the negative reviews. Absolutely useless. I am trying to get equipment moved. It has taken months and they keep sending the wrong engineer.
I email consumer-resolutionteam many times but they don't even acknowledge receipt. Avoid any company with 'British' in its name.

Edit: so I contacted BT via FB and their response was: we can't do it fill out an open reach form. This is despite BT telling me in September that I can't do that and it has to be done through BT. They also told me multiple times they were liasing with OR to get it done. So even worse service via FB.

Edit 2: finally BT said they'd sort it and an Openreach manager would come on Monday. Of course, no one showed up.

Edit 3: BT just called to say they can't do anything and everything they've told me in the past is wrong. So I've spoken to about 7 BT employees and I'm skeptical that the last one is correct.

I've wasted hours on this dealing with this lousy company.",0

"It would appear that BT have more bad reviews than you can shake a stick at!! (Don't worry if you haven't understood that comment it's a saying that old people like me used to say!!)
The clue is in the comment, ""Yes"" older people like me just want a peaceful life, more over a hassle free transition would have been brilliant,however;that's not how it went.
Customer service are quick to respond to phone call I'll give them that,however that's it.
After convincing me that BT are the best I ask them to take over my, phone and broadband and on the 21st April after having all my equipment delivered I was excited to connect.
Two hours and 5 arguments with my partner later I had to submit and call ""The Tech Guys"" and I was told what I was trying to do wasn't possible, ""Couldn't add Disney Plus to the box"" someone should have said before I changed over.
1st disappointment and 1st call to tech,
2nd Couldn't connect to my security system
2nd call to tech, sorry but your box is a 5G and is not compatible with your camera's
I was promised a different router on the 23rd it's now the 30th and still no box.
No patience left BT has pushed me to a point where ""I'm losing the will to even speak to them anymore""
Quick phone call back to EE and a transition back on the 12th May ""I hope""
Never got my router"" probably lost in the great abyss of BT mess ups and their customer service team are embarrassed when people like me ring to ask "" where is my router?
Given time and the amount of mess ups you may probably find a large number of BT staff sat dribbling in a corner staring into space.
Well that's me finished, however if BT want to expand then you may find a market in fantasy.",0

"Aftery recent call I'm extremely angry and disgusted with this servies. I came out of contract with Vodafone on the 28th April 2022, which means I'll be in a rolling contract e.g. limbo... I want to change the sim to pay as you go starting today so I don't pay any of the day to day charges. The lady Natalie Atkinson from the stoke office, delt with my call... wasn't listening to anything that I was stating. Even though they are fully aware that I'm 34 weeks pregnant and high risk which I made very clear at the start of the call... the call started off okai, until I stated I want to leave... as Natalie started telling me that I'll still be paying the standard charge of ¬£49 a month. Which is a pack of lies.. and a misadvisation. If someone is out of contract there will be standard rolling charges of per call and texts and data. I kept requesting for a manager, Natalie kept ignoring my request even though I stated she wasn't listening and stressing me out more. Making me high rated as she wasn't listening at all. Asked for her name 7 times before she actually stated her name.... in-between her trying to justify her call... I just had enough of the call and stated ill just redial to someone who knows how's to do there job. Youssef elshemy took my next call understanding what I was asking to cancel down my out of contract sim as I will be moving away from Vodafone for good due to the appalling services they are now distributing. Appalling rude customer service advisor who love to stress customers out especially when they have requested to speak to there team leader over 25 times but wasn't listening trying to justify there actions. Thank you so much for the stress Natalie I'm now on the way to the hospital as I have High blood pressure... and thank you Youssef for correcting Natalie's lies and mistakes",0

"I decided to go with PC Specialist due to their great reviews compared to competitors, the turn out was definitely not as expected during the long process.

The graphics card shortage was not much of an issue, but the service provided is not ideal to say the least - the main issue I have encountered is when I received the computer as it was working fine for a couple of weeks before a loud noise begun coming from the left side of the graphics card which I just understood may be temporary or normal, this eventually lead to the graphics card LED warning lights coming on and my computer completely freezing and being unable to use within a month or two after waiting over 160 days‚Äô, therefore I sent it back for repair which was a simple reinstalling of drivers and just over a week later I received my computer back and noticed damage to the outside of the box and upon opening it I saw the entire top panel of my computer snapped at the screws and a big dent down the back where the graphics card sits - I sent it back to be fully replaced as I was concerned that the internals may be damaged to which one employee spoke to his team leader while accidentally taking me off hold to say they haven‚Äôt had any problems like this before, and that I am not trusted due to making a complaint before, then they realised I heard them saying this and placed me back on hold immediately and acted like this never happened, however the call was recorded. After speaking with seniors within the company they said all components will be fully replaced with new part, now today I have received the computer back yet again after 2 weeks‚Äô this time and I had to query whether the components were actually replaced as I noticed there is a very slight similarity on one part - this prompt them to respond that in fact, no the graphics card was not replaced which was the reason it was sent back, and to top it off I have had it returned here roughly 6 hours ago and it is freezing and crashing yet again after rigorous stress testing, therefore it will have to be sent back again for a 3rd time.

I run my business through the high spec PC I ordered as my previous one could not handle the job, and so far I have not had any income for a month due to not being able to work because my PC needs repairing constantly or the delivery provider damaging the package in transit.

I generally do not write reviews, but I feel this is necessary as there is no action taking place in preventing further issues or fixing the original problem.

I will mention a bright side, the computer looks amazing, appears to be packaged very well on original purchase and the tracking team are very helpful!

I look forward to following up on this in the future and hope for a positive change.",0

"The service I have received from KnowHow has been absolutely appalling, and I will never again take out a care plan with them. They have been unhelpful, won't put me through to managers, and haven't done their job half the time.

My laptop went away for repairs at the end of March, and I was told it would definitely be back within 7-days. It came back FOUR WEEKS later, and that was after lots of calling (and being hung up on), false promises, including being told it was being written off as per their 7-day promise of replacing it if is runs over time. This didn't happen. The service was horrendous, and the fault wasn't even fixed. Citizens Advice suggested taking it to court.

The laptop went away for repair again, came back in 7-days this time, and was still not working.

It went away a third time, and was written off. They said I would get a voucher to replace the product. It came in and it was ¬£200 short of the exact laptop they are selling. I rang and they refused to put me through to a manager, and said they won't honour the like for like replacement (mine has a detachable tablet).

Disgusting service, and I will be taking this to Trading Standards.

"Terrible!!! Just terrible. Having used them for two homes now, I can honestly say that I will avoid them like the plague forever more. The thing they're worst at is account closure administration, and they're pretty bad with admin relating to a change of account holder too. One advisor tells you one thing, then when that thing doesn't happen as they assured you, another advisor gives you a completely different story of what is supposed to happen. They're just really bad at their job and it's not the advisors that are at fault, it's probably the company itself not providing adequate training, or just not providing a good enough service all round. You end up having to chase and chase them, which begins to feel that you're doing their job for them (which you might as well, to get anything actually done!).

"Terrible customer service! I ordered an upgrade on 1st August, phone arrived next day. Sounds great? But no, they'd not processed it as an upgrade but as a new connection meaning my existing phone number wasn't transferred.
I spoke to customer services, they said I'd need to place another order for the upgrade and at the same time cancel the new connection. I did this on 3rd August, paying out a deposit on a second phone. I returned the unwanted phone as directed.
Since then, they've 1) tried to send me a third phone (I refused delivery), 2) failed to cancel my new connection despite contacting this customer services by phone, webchat and email, 3) said they've issued a refund for the returned phone by cheque after 1 month of battling that could take 28 working days to arrive, 4) accidently cancelled my wanted upgrade and have refused to reinstate it and 5) said they would refund the line rental of the unwanted new connection if I sent them an itemised bill but that's not happened either.

We have had a new insulation and the young lad who they have sent has messed right up so badly that he has not even connected up to the wires. Don't say he is a sub contractor and it's not your fault. Rubbish service again BT you have failed me once again",0
"Very poor service for such a big company. Swapped broadband provider to someone else 2mths ago, they acknowledged this but still charge me.

"In July I was in London on holiday from Australia and told the sales person in a Three shop that I wanted mobile service for two months. He sold me a contract and said I could cancel after a month by phoning a number he wrote on the contract. I did this to cancel the contract in August and the automated message said the contract had been cancelled but now in November Three have not cancelled the contract and are still billing me for a service I don't use and threatening to register me as a bad debt with credit reference agencies if I don't pay. I couldn't download the app in the UK so am relying on emails but even after emailing them in October when they first made the threat, paying the excess charge and saying I want to cancel the service, they have now in November sent an email with a further larger fee saying they have not cancelled the account yet, and will charge me for 30 days more after they decide to cancel my contract. Two months mobile service which they said would cost ¬£56 has so far been billed for ¬£144.86 and I don't know when it will end.",0

"Utterly useless. They contacted my mum to upgrade her internet to fibre. They installed a new router which then didn‚Äôt work. When they finally answer the phone the call agent tells me they should not have sent this router and will replace it. A new router never arrives. Several phone calls later, another call agent says they sent the wrong router and need to send a different one and that previous colleagues got it all wrong (why the call agent is laughing in disbelief at this stage I don‚Äôt know!). The new router has now arrived and guess what‚Ä¶.no connection. I‚Äôve now been on the phone for 1 hour 40 minutes waiting for technical support. I did get through to one agent after 50 minutes but he said his own system wasn‚Äôt working so had to place me back in the queue. I feel sorry for their call agents who are poorly trained and seemingly powerless.",0
"Extremely poor service. I was delivered a faulty dishwasher the end of March and It has taken over a month of talking most days to Team Knowhow as well as Currys to try and get it sorted. They were going to repair it, but the part wasn't due in stock until the end of May. That would have been over 2 months of a faulty dishwasher that I haven't even been able to use just sitting in my kitchen. I was advised to get a refund. The whole process just to get an Uplift number to be even able to start the process of getting my money back was an absolute pain. I was told 24 hours and it took over a week to get it. Promises from them that I would get it that day, and even to the point that they promises head office would call me to give it to me yet I received no phone call. I have finally managed to get my Uplift number today after having to be quite stern on the phone with them. Do not understand why you even need an uplift number if you have the original receipt. Would not recommend. Really disappointed in Currys that they make the process of just trying to get money back from a product that they delivered with a fault so difficult. Really would not recommend and I soon as I get my money back, I will be looking elsewhere to get a new dishwasher. Really poor service.",0
"the online team are the worst i have ever dealt with, ordered a tv and sound bar ¬£1300. to be collected from north shields, all paid, e mail received stating its ordered and will be in contact when ready for collection, waited in all day waiting for email. Rang the so-called help number, to be told the order had been cancelled. no reason apart they might have no stock, the person on the phone was no help and had no reason why it had been cancelled when i pointed out the store shows it had stock. in the end I went to the store, they could see the order i placed and agreed it had been cancelled for no reason. I thought the service was the worse I have experienced. a simple phone call/e mail would have been nice. The store had 13 in stock. I was also told the ¬£1300 i paid will be returned in 3-5 working days, WHY?? they gave no service and no reason for the cancelled items.",0

"Not a good experience. I am Power of Attorney for my dad. He has Alzheimer‚Äôs so I tend to deal with all his affairs. I registered my Power of Attorney with Vodafone and had access to dads account.

I can‚Äôt uograde or downgrade to a better deal/package. I can do nothing. I contact Vodafone again (probably 5th or 6th long phone call by now and patience wearing thin). I‚Äôm then assured all will be well. I go back to dads account only this time to find I can‚Äôt even get into the account. I was right back where I first started. Eventually, after about the 10th call to Vodafone, I manage to get back in but still can‚Äôt do anything once in. I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not my account and Power of Attorneys can only browse!!

"My name is Kaseter Hayne I purchased a washer, dryer and fridge freezer from currys back in 2016 and a dishwasher 2018. All my appliances have knowhow cover which I have paid just short of ¬£10 for every single month. Back on the 16th of September my washer stopped working. With an Error 21 code and a knocking drum. An engineer was booked for the following day and I was informed that engineer would call 20 minutes before arrival. I left to collect my son from nursery at 12:10pm and returned home just after 12:30pm to find a card through the door saying engineer called at 12:20pm I rang team knowhow immediately where I was told he had tried to call and got the answer machine. My phone was next to me the whole time no calls where recieved and even if I am another call my phone stills pulls through other calls so this was a blatant lie. Anyway engineer was rebooked and visited Saturday were it was confirmed that the spider on the drum had snapped and replacement would be required due to this being the 6th fault within just a little over 12 months I requested a new washer and the washer was apparently officially written off on the 23rd of September and I was informed that vouchers woukd take a maximum of 12 days. I have made contact with team knowhow on several occasions in which everytime I wait for over an hour to speak to someone and on several occasions I have bedn hung up on and today it was definitely deliberate, my complaint on Friday had not been escalated my vouchers have not been recieved for the washer. I am very upset and angry about the way I have been treated. I have 4 small children at home with no washer and no dryer and I suffer with a disability of multiple sclerosis. And not to mention the fact that 3 days after my washer broke my dryer packed up working too. An engineer visited promptly informed me the dryer was also a write off and I should recieve and call soon. I had to make contact with knowhow myself and was informed that the dryer was fixable and an engineer from another company would be out to look within 3-5 days. Engineer visited 4 days later and 4 days after that I was informed that price of parts to fix the machine was higher than they have authority to carry out and the matter was being referred back to knowhow. This was done on the 28th September and on the 30th I rang team knowhow again to find they had still not had an update at their end from connect. Friday I called again still no confirmation if the position of the dryer and again today I called chasing vouchers for the washer and information on the dryer and after waiting an hour and 15 minutes to speak with someone they hung up after several minutes of discussing my issues. The service is totally shocking and your staff need to be trained in their customers care skills. Disgusted at the way I have been treat in my current situation and this current climate.

Very unhappy customer",0
"10 days since my second review and since then, not a single thing has happened to progress my order. I did receive two text messages, on different days, saying somebody would call me in the afternoon to discuss my account, and then nobody called either time.

I‚Äôm in my third month of waiting and we still haven‚Äôt got past the first step of having the external engineer arrive. So far, I‚Äôve been told:
- the external work has started, but just not finished (not true, nothing has happened).
- it will be done after the initial date I was told due to a backlog, but Open Reach have a scheme to catch up on all late jobs by 21/12 (didn‚Äôt happen).
- Open Reach have a shortage of skilled engineers (I‚Äôm in London, not the middle of nowhere, and I‚Äôm sure this isn‚Äôt the first time they‚Äôve been asked to install fibre in London).
- Open Reach have a plan to train staff to be able to do the work I require (it‚Äôs just installing my internet?!?! They‚Äôre not a start up company and this seems a pretty standard job for them?!).

The BT customer service people always pick up quickly when I phone, and are polite, but neither of us know what to say to each other at this point.

BT have escalated my case with Open Reach three times, which results in nobody doing anything still.

Before I get a response on here, I have not contacted anybody via social media. For what? All they will tell me is ‚Äúopen reach still haven‚Äôt done anything‚Äù.

I just want internet LOL",0

"I've always gone to carphone warehouse for years and years because I'm not good a technical stuff and in the past they have been so kind and helpful transferring data from one phone to another etc. This time I renewed with my provider (ID mobile) online. I told them I needed help with data transfer and they said they were part of Carphone Warehouse and that I could go to the Exeter branch of Carphone warehouse and have it all done for free. I went on 30 May. It was a nightmare experience. A lad in his twenties was rude and unpleasant to me. He said Carphone Warehouse was forbidden because of Covid from transferring data for customers. I asked if I could try to do it there myself, with him watching and helping. No. That was impossible as it would 'take six hours to connect to Carphone Warehouse's Wifi'. He also refused to sell me a screen protector and a phone holder, telling me to 'Go to Amazon' for them instead. When I asked if I could pay to join Carphone Warehouse's insurance and help service 'Geek Squad' to get a data transfer he said there wasn't any point as they wouldn't be able to do it either. He was VILE. Basically, his attitude was 'F off and die.' I'm never going to Carphone Warehouse again, ever. (Oh, by the way, I'm a middle-aged woman, which was probably the main reason the guy was nasty.)",0

"I recently moved two accounts for Broadband service from BT to Shell Energy Broadband, and I sincerely wish I had never done so! The ""Go Live"" date for both properties was 17 November but the Shell Router at both properties would not connect to the internet. There was no communication from Shell, and it was virtually impossible to get through to them on the phone. When I did get through, I was told that one property had ""not gone live"" and I was put on hold for the agent to speak to the technical dept. After being on hold for over 50 minutes the line disconnected and no one called me back. I sent an email and was called back the next day and told there ""Was a crossed-line fault"" on both properties and I needed an Openreach Engineer to come to visit both properties. Before Shell would send an Openreach Engineer I had to agree to new terms and conditions which involved potential additional charges to rectify these ""faults."" I was subjected to considerable pressure on the phone to agree to schedule these visits and agreeing to pay these potential charges. I refused to do this and wrote to complain about the abysmal service and being pressured to pay an open-ended amount of money. I have changed Internet providers previously at both of these properties and never ever had any problems before like this. The seamless transfer to Shell Energy has proved anything but seamless! I am a 75-year-old who is not technically adept but I managed to get a friend to connect the Shell router to the inner socket of the existing BT Openreach socket behind the outer plate, inside the properties of the houses. There was no ""crossed line fault"" at either property and I was put under unfair and unreasonable pressure to agree to pay for Engineer visits for a fault that did not exist. So I managed to eventually get both the routers to work, but no thanks to Shell. I would add that the Shell Energy router is substantially inferior to the BT router and in my experience is not fit for purpose. The router signal is weak and it does not work upstairs at the property. The agent to whom I spoke at Shell Energy said I was not the first to complain about the quality of the router! Do not expect your experience with Shell Energy Broadband to be simple or easy and if I could rate Shell Energy Broadband as zero stars I would! AVOID!!",0

Can‚Äôt understand Shell allowing these jokers to use the brand‚Ä¶ which is trusted as a mark of quality!

In response to the Reply from Sara at Shell Energy on 23 Sept. Don‚Äôt worry Sara I‚Äôve heard so many lies from Shell Energy, I have now initiated proceedings with the small claims court to recover my money. If nothing else I hope this gives Shell energy the adverse publicity it deserves!
28 Sept to give you a clear example of the service (and lies) from this company - see the response from Sara to my complaint and her statement that they would be in touch ASAP - still no contact 5 days later and 2 more emails from me! Her comment is clearly for public consumption without any intention to act! If Sara has any integrity I think she‚Äôd get a job with another company!

Seriously need to consider if you are going to use this company! In hindsight I‚Äôd have paid ¬£10 a month extra to go with an alternative provider.

On the 19th I received a fault report by email claiming the power supply was faulty which it clearly was not (I've BSc in Electrical and Electronic Engineering and know a dead power supply when I see one).
The laptop was re delivered with a new power supply on the 20th May. I plugged it in, waited for it to charge and the self same fault was evident. Dead with flashing random keys.
On Monday 23rd of May I formally rejected the laptop Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 as not fit for purpose. I clearly stated I wanted a full refund or a brand new replacement. PCS offered a new replacement. I accepted the replacement. The faulty laptop was collected on 25th of May and I was advised my new laptop was in build. After hearing nothing from PCS I called this morning 30th May. After a few hours I was advised my new laptop was ready for dispatch but wouldn't be shipped until they'd booked in the old one. Their courier DPD has had it in their Birmingham no 3 depot and it hasn't moved since the 25th May. I had to find this out myself and tell PCS! PCS want me to wait on the off chance that DPD find the parcel and get it to them all the while holding my money for nearly a month now. They have refused to ship my new laptop until they have the defective one back but no one is chasing DPD it would seem as they didn't know where it was.
It's their courier and their contract and they should sort it out and give me the laptop I paid for.
At 4pm today I emailed customer services and copied Danny Williams their Director with two options. Ship my laptop or refund me in full. If neither is forthcoming I will seek redress through the small claims court process.
Things to know about PCS:-
1, Customer services aren't fit for purpose.
2, A supervisor or member of the management team isn't ever available to speak to should you ask. A deliberate ploy used by many customer services tbh.
3, Getting information out of them requires masses of emails, phone calls and luck.
4, Problems with their contracted shipper becomes your problem. They don't seem to want to get involved.
5, There is no one who will own your problem and sort things out so each time your ring it's a different person who knows nothing of the problem you have and needs to start the investigation all over again.
This has been by far the worst consumer experience I've had in 60 years. I would avoid PCS at all costs as my family and friends will. They don't appear to give jot about their customers and don't understand the term ' Customer Service'.",0
I brought a PC from your self's and it came dirty that dirty I am surprised it works,0
"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
They damaged my property when installing my services. They also have left the outside wires in a horrible mess.
I was told I had to pay ¬£25 to fix the damage that they caused.
I have had 2 engineers turn up to attend the property and both left without doing anything.
Do not use this company unless you wanna spend hours on the phone trying to get things fixed.
AVOID THIS COMPANY",0
"Ordered around 15 items from Morrisons. Only 2 items were delivered. Almost ¬£6 in fees for ¬£2 worth of food.
Spoke with customer services who basically said tough. I didn't use deliveroo much anyway but certainly won't use again. Will now speak with PayPal regarding refund of fees.",0

"Was given a Chromebook as a birthday present in July. On the 23 December I opened the screen to find a grey line running along the top of the screen. Took it into Currys the next day, to be informed it had to be sent out for repair. After 30mdays there is no exchange allowed. Item was returned a few days later stating that there was damage to screen. When i opened the screen at home, to speak to the customer service folk, there was a massive grey ""blob"" over 2/3 of the screen. HP repairs stated that there was a massive crack down the scree, which was not the case when it was sent off. Have made 4 calls into the customer service folk and have eventually spoken to a manager. Curry can't help as the repair centre state that the crack is not repairable under their warranty. Even though the 2nd call to the customer service team said they would repair the Chromebook. they now claim it is not their call to make. I now have to WRITE a letter to try and obtain assistance from their head office, as there is no email that I can use in order to appeal. VERY disappointed and Currys has lost me as a customer.",0
"Spoke to an Alex working in Stockport who refused to give me her full name after asking for mine. She refused to provide me with the managers name also. I have logged in to find BT have increased the price of my 24 month contract of which only has been going for 12 months. They have not honoured the agreement. This is disgraceful especially with living costs going up.

I called again and spoke to a Sue, I said i wanted to log a complaint and she referred me to bt.com and advised this needs to be done online.
I went online to my surprise the site recommended complaints are logged by telephone.

I called to speak with Danny, and expressed my complaint, i asked him for service level agreement timescales when to hear back, to which he hung up on me and refused to log my complaint.

Terrible service, BT advertised product for 24 months @ ¬£29.99 but the truth is the customer will NEVER pay ¬£29.99 for the full 2 years after a year BT increase the tariff therefore the product has no integrity.

With the price of living increasing is dispicable to find out large companies like BT are not trying to aid their existing customers at all.

Dan have you heard the call? Or are you responding merely by reading my Complaint? If you had listened to the call you'd know that your colleague told me he will terminate the call and said he won't log my complaint. Furthermore, I've seen your complaints procedure to which it states ""recommended to do via telephone"" are you saying this is not the case? Lastly my complaint is regarding the offer and how it is unethical for the following reason;

You state that price will increase every year, yet you advertised the deal at ¬£29,99 for 24 months, however no customer will EVER pay ¬£29,99 for 24 months because of that clause therefore you are misinterpreting what the customer actually receives, which is not ¬£29,99 for 24 months.

Do you not see how unethical that is?",0
"I ordered and paid for a phone from Quick Mobile Fix in Feb 2021, as they did not have the phone I cancelled the order. The company agreed, in an email of 17th Feb 2021, to refund me my money.

Yes, they're very good at coming on here and responding to negative posts with platitudes, but getting them to engage in a meaningful conversation about their truly appalling customer service clearly seems to be a tad challenging for them.

"I managed to setup 2 mobile phone contracts because process crashed first time and no confirmation email was sent out.

"I had a pristine ipad to sell. I used the online system to agree a price, and then took it into the store.

The store agreed it was pristine, but then the haggling started!

No box, so they wanted 32% off. 32% for a cardboard box that nobody needs or uses!

Then they got on to the missing cable, but I didn‚Äôt find out how much they wanted off for that, as it was obvious where the process was headed. There are all sorts of bits of packing, guarantee leaflets, etc that they could go on quibbling about until they got the price down to virtually nothing.

Anyway, I left, and I won‚Äôt bother with them again.

Music Magpie offered less to begin with, but they appear to have a more straightforward approach.",0
Terrible WIFI signal meant I needed to speak to Virgin. I‚Äôve never written a review before about anything but Virgin has forced me to do so! Quite literally the worst customer service experience I‚Äôve ever encountered! We went round in circles for weeks across multiple time consuming calls and they still did not acknowledge or fix the problem. Finally decided to go with another provider and they charged me hundred of pounds to leave! DO NOT GO WITH VIRGIN!,0

Tired of chasing them up, and being given unreasonable responses. This is not acceptable when people work from home and rely on internet. Will be cancelling immediately.",0
Cancelled my Now TV membership months ago only to find they have been taking payments every month for the last 3 months. Only reason I noticed this was because my Aqua card was over the limit.

"TL;DR: pay a bit more and go somewhere else if you want real customer services and after sales.

We were moving home so we decided to buy new appliances and decided for Currys because we trusted their services even though they were not the cheapest. How wrong we were...

I ordered online through their website and then talked on the chat about delivery. They reassured me they would deliver to the first floor without lift to my flat door. A week after the order Currys called me trying to sell the extra warranty. I asked again about delivery after I said I did not want this extra warranty, and again they reassured me they will certainly deliver.

Delivery day. Disappointment day. Delivery guys said they will not lift the washer dryer because they have 30 more deliveries and they wouldn't be able to do them if they lifted every one of them (bad luck being one of the first ones). They also told me to call customer services and request a delivery refund.

I spent 3 hours that day on the phone with Currys. 3 different agents pass me from one to another without issuing any refund. I hung up.

I tried one week later and they hung up on me twice.

I tried again a few days later and one agent started to issue the refund for the delivery but the call got ""cut"". I called again and another agent denied the delivery involved lifting appliances to your flat. I requested to speak to a manager. They said they were booking a manager call next day between 4 and 6pm. It is 1 week already and I am still waiting for that manager to call me.

I would avoid Currys if I was you. Try luck with the other appliances providers.",0

"Rubbish service and idiotic behaviour. Paid extra for install of washing machine and the just disconnect previous. On coming to site- said rudely that I have to disconnect. When i explained that they have to do it as already agreed did a shabby job disconnecting and almost spoiled the floor and surrounding alliances. They seemed more interested in getting out of the property asap. Also did not connect the washing machine by making all kinds of excuses. First said they need joiners for hose which they did not have. For heaven sake if you have come to fix a machine at least carry equipment. Then did not connect the inlet hose even. It was a team of 2 and first guy said you can do it yourself just bring the 2 ends together.
What idiocy, why would I pay you to then do it myself. Rubbish service. I will never ever use them. Far better getting your own plumber to do it for you.",0
"One star is even too much for this scam!
Avoid to buy any product from them - Customer service agents are not aware about their promotions and products and they have not patience or knowledge to help you! If you are very unlucky they even hung up the phone on you.

On 17th May, I bought Huawei Smart watch Gt2 from Carphone Warehouse rather than Huawei Website (I had ¬£20off voucher for Huawei Website which I could use), because they offer a Huawei Band E3 as a free gift, which never arrived.

I have contacted many times the customer service and firstly they said to wait because the free gift it was on the way, after they said I supposed to claim the Band E3 to the > promotions Huawei website directly - WHERE THIS HAS BEEN MENTIONED?. I have tried and I even called them but this promotion apparently does not exist and they only provide a smart scale but with the GT2e not GT2. I have tried to apply for the scale anyway, as I thought ""better then nothing"", even though I have paid more for the watch, but nothing...I was not elegible!
After that, Huawei kindly invited me to complaint to Carphone Warehouse, that apparently provided wrong/fake information (SCAM) and also it did not even stated on the website that there is a need to claim the watch online because the free gift will NEVER arrive to your house like this (actually it will never arrive ANYWAY).

The only note written is "" Please note when you order, the Huawei Band E3 will not appear in the basket, once checkout is complete it will be delivered separately after 14-28 days of receiving your handset"" ...AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

I have regretted that I did not use the ¬£20 discount and that I did not buy the watch from Huawei website directly instead of getting scammed by them.

AVOID THEM... YOU WILL LOOSE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!",0
first of all I have to say the new assistant at your Basildon out of town store did really well. However when I asked if I could check if my current sim card would fit into my new phone I was told in no uncertain terms by a more senior member of staff that they did not have one on show I could try or open a new box. I would need to go back to my sim provider if it did not fit. Unbelievable!,0
"Awful service. Ordered a printer for my business - screen said free next day delivery but when ordering only option was delivery 3 days later. which wasnt great but fair enough. delivery date came and went and never dispatched. Called and they waived delivery charge and put it down for next day delivery. Again didnt get dispatched. After 3 days of calling to try and resolve, eventually after many non returned calls and broken promises i received an email saying cannot dispatch, how about this other printer instead? having already ordered elsewhere a set of toners for the printer i wanted and wasted over 8 days with Ebuyer i was forced to cancel the whole order and register a formal complaint.

In meantime bill came posted cheque 3/12/22, then on 31/12/22 got a letter saying amount outstanding, even though it had gone out of my bank! Phoned up she said yes we got it, and you are 53 in credit, we will send a cheque , can take 12 to 15 days, fair enough.

I‚Äôm utterly disgusted. I contact Vodafone customer service to discuss the current policy on an upgrade because I wanted to give my dad my old phone however I had to ask questions because last year my bill got increase due CPI and I was furious so I wanted to know what are the current policy before upgrading however the customer agent were so rude even after asking for a corporation and even after waiting in the line for a while she then drop my chat with no explanation.

"I tried to place an order with a restaurant, the app crashed, I did not receive a confirmation email from deliveroo so I placed the order again a few minutes later (granted I added extra poppadoms as I had decided I wanted them as I was re-entering details). I received a confirmation email and delivery code for second attempt. My order was delivered but I have been charged twice on my card. Deliveroo customer services have been less than helpful and will not refund the money for the second order that I never received. They kept telling me that two orders were successfully delivered but that was not the case and as far as I was aware the first order was not even submitted successfully. Given the current times ¬£52 is not an insignificant sum of money and I had saved up to get a treat in a very difficult month but now I will have to struggle to pay a bill because they have effectively stolen money from me. I am disgusted and will never be using deliveroo again. I will be using JustEat as I have never had issues with their app crashing or being charged money for items I have never received. My advice is never use Deliveroo.",0
"Terrible customer care!! Avoid avoid. Purchased a H/AC unit in the summer, really liked it and worked well for 10 weeks then just lost all power. After lots of emails with photos and telling them numerous times I had checked fuse and plug socket. They agreed a return 2 weeks later. Got an email saying yes manufacturer fault after another 2 weeks but no refund would be given as apparently remote was missing. It was with the unit when it left my home. Then I was told I needed to pay a usage fee of 20% which is not legal when a product is under 6 months old. Then offered another refund with a 10% usage fee then 50% usage fee, just kept changing. I was entitled to a full refund or replacement and was not excepting them keeping any money. Then was told it was damaged in transit and yet saw no photos of so called damage I asked for. It was packaged well with a black bag over it to hold the remote and vent tube. It was picked up by courier they booked. How is it my fault it was damaged in transit. I was told on the phone they usually refurbish faulty items in their brand for resale,but couldn't as mine was damaged. I saw it for sale in refurbished section a few weeks later!! I proved it left here in perfect still new looking condition with packaging but not working. Took over another month of emails and telling them the law and nearly went to small claims court but they refunded the full amount in the end!! 2 and a half months to get my money back. Good job i managed without it. It was extremely stressful but worth pursuing since the unit was just short of ¬£500 and under 6 months old. Should of lasted a few years not weeks. All would of been ok if not for the fault. It was delivered on time in perfect condition.
Never shop with them as if you get a problem you will have a struggle getting a replacement or a refund or any help.. I was spoken to rudely and made out to be in the wrong.

They cant even tell me when it will be delivered and everytime they say someone will call me back they dont. They are just Liars. We have now spoke to a fourth person who said since the missed delivery, it was booked back in for monday delivery and had never been out for delivery today.

"I ordered a washing machine from Currys in November and took delivery in December. I have no issue with the machine itself, which runs perfectly well. Unfortunately it hasn't been installed well, which I discovered after finding water pooled on the floor. I called a plumber who removed the machine to check the pipework, and upon inspection it appears that the outlet pipe leaks and has allowed dirty water to collect in one of my cupboards, covering foods and other kitchen items in dirty water.
This was compounded by damage caused to the vinyl floor during the moving of the washing machine by the plumber, which will also need replacing.",0

We put it on despite following the manufacturers advice to the letter and after final spin clothes still rather wet.
We have had to phone customer services daily now for over a week to either be cut off or when we do eventually get through we are told a different story everytime, and fobbed off, no I know by consumer law we have 3, days to decide if we are happy with the purchase or not, and we are definitely not happy, keep being told we need to contact the manufacture despite the fact our contract is with marks electrical not the manufacturer therefore their responsibility to resolve the issue. Have been told by Marks electrical that a refund will take up to 14 days after they have picked up the machine and tested it. We agreed with them we will accept a different machine in exchange now there are going back on this agreement we have now contacted the manufacturer as was told we need a uplift number in order to get replacement machine, but manufacturer will not give us one until the machine has been condemned.
It's obvious we are being told a different story everytime we ring Marks electrical and everytime you ring them same thing over 20 people waiting in the queue,
Spent hours upon hours on hold it now got to the point where we are going to go down the legal route as they are blatantly breaking the consumer law.

Posted a complaint on their website, now I‚Äôm blocked from it.
SCAM! Dont get CAUGHT!",0
"Been waiting in all day, the hottest of the year for my washing m/c to be delivered. Unsurprisingly, it did not arrive. The so called tracking system remained at ""order in progress"" and is the most unhelpful and useless I have come across. I had paid for the m/c to be installed but after reading all the reviews for Team Know Nothing, I drove straight to Currys and demanded a refund. Told it was over 21 days from date of purchase and I would have to accept a credit note. No way - the timing was down to Currys and not me and after involving the manager a full refund was given. How Currys can stay in partnership with these cowboys is beyond me.",0

I have ordered washing machine part on 22/12/2022.I have tried to get in touch with eSpares .but no joy. I have also emailed them and tried calling no answer. I have know bought new washing machine. The part still hasn't been delivered. I have also tried to contact them to cancel my order. Still no response. This company is the worst to order any thing form.,0
"Ordered furniture which eventually arrived - all good. Set up DD to pay in full so I got 15% off the price of the furniture; they didn't take the payment but instead sent me a bill with a late payment charge on it! Rang to have the charges removed, paid the balance in full and close the account. Now received another bill with charges on it! Absolute shambles will never use Very again. Avoid like the plague!",0
Took my money but cancelled the order then held my money for a week,0
"I just signed up for a free trial. I installed the player. It didn't work. I tried again It didn't work. Then I asked for help from a virtual assistant. This took so long I lost the will to live. She told me to uninstall the player, but when I did I couldn't re-install it. It went on so long I said I'd like to cancel my subscription. She told me I was still signed up for Boost, whatever that is and would be charged. I couldn't find it on the website to cancel it. In the end I asked her THREE times to cancel my subscription. Finally she did. That was my evening's entertainment. NOT WORTH IT!",0
"The delivery company claimed I was out when they attempted to deliver my item on Saturday 14 Jan 23, and had left a card telling me what to do. I was at home and received no card. When I contacted the company they promised delivery the next day. After several communications with the company and being promised delivery on the 17th, the parcel finally arrived on the 18th.",0

"The driver called me on my mobile but he was standing far away from my door never knocked or never tried to deliver . My kids were in the hall way screaming and playing he could hear them but my mobile was out of charge which can happen to anyone . But this driver thought it is OK to take the food with him instead he could've left it at the door . And moreover on the app it was showing order delivered and contacted customer service but they were just saying so we can't provide compensation but I never asked for one I just was asking to re deliver the food again. As this was my kids food .utterly disgusted by the drivers behaviour and deliveroos customer service .

"One star seems to be still to high and im not exaggerating. First thing it cost ¬£7,99 a month to be lied to. Secondly they should change name to Do Not Know How! For third if they are sending you message that your item is ready to collect well its not i have wasted time fuel and money to pick item that wasn't repaired or in the shop even!!!! Does it make sense? no it does not!!! In the end is cheaper to go for IT studies then trust this bunch of w ‚öì 's really disappointed with them!!!!",0
"The worst company I have EVER dealt with!

Purchased a phone online and got delivered a different model from what I ordered. When the item arrived, i called them customer service team to make them aware and they created a return for me with a label. I sent the item back and was told that this was not the phone I ordered (WELL YES, THATS WHY I SENT IT BACK). Then a week later I reached out to someone via Twitter as customer service was useless and no help at all. The guy on Twitter told me that they have checked the warehouse cctv footage and that the correct phone was sent and they therefore will send the phone back to me. I have asked for the footage and they are unable to share for whatever reason. Anyways they said theyll send the phone back . I was away in August on holiday and randomly got a message from DPD to say we are delivering your parcel from CPW. Obv im away so theres no one to open the door and sign for it. So DPD delivery fails for that day and the next 2 days. I try to track to see where the item is, it says your item is on its way back to Currys as we are unable to leave the parcel anywhere. So now im back from holiday, im calling customer service to find out whats happened to my money or the phone, they are saying we sent it back to you, its not our fault you were home :/...what on earth! I wasn't even made aware that something will get sent back to me and i was away, how am i meant to sign for it. The south african customer service rep was so rude and aggressive on the phone, telling me theyve done all they can and theyve sent the phone back. SO WHERE IS IT? I wasn't home to sign for it, you havent left it anywhere, so where isit? I asked for the tracking and proof from DPD to see where it is, the rep was like, I dont know, i dont have a tracking number... so how am i meant to believe its been sent back to me?? where is your proof!? its Carphones responsibility to send this phone back safely to my hands and they have failed to do so... now they are not taking responsibility! I have no tracking number, no proof, no phone in my hands and short of ¬£429!!!! The worst company to deal with!!!",0
First time I've ordered from Carphone Warehouse. Never damaged my phone before but by chance my phone got wet and the response I got from them was a no and nothing else can be done. So I've gone to them and bought a ¬£400 phone and a few weeks later asked for some help with it and they don't care.,0
"I cancelled my contract in November after my bill continued to rise. After spending over an hour on trying to cancelling my contract and having to call 3 times, I received another bill from them for December. Again, called several times in December and had several live chats. and was told that account was definitely cancelled and that my account will be credited to cover the bill in December. I asked for my cancelation to be put in writing and was told i will receive this after the 28 day cancellation period is over. I have just received an email now saying I will be billed again on 31.01.23 for an amount of ¬£21 which was not even the amount I used to pay? where are they getting these numbers from? I am currently on the painfully slow live chat now (which you are advised to use when calling) and no doubt be told the they have resolved my problem but wont have.

As others have said, don't be tempted by the prices. Awful company.",0
"I bought an airram for 129.99 pounds. A few days later I was emaied with an offer of 10% off A few days later I was offered the Same product with 80 pounds off.

Not a way to treat an old customer.
When I asked about a new battery for our old airram, you still wanted to charge me the same high price.

"Tried to exchange a charging cable that failed within a month. Didn‚Äôt take my word for it even though I tested it. Took my phone and before I could stop him, he was scraping the contacts with a metal sim remover. Although my charging port is working (for now) the pins and visibly bent. He then (should have done this first) tried a known good lead (worked) then my faulty lead (didn‚Äôt work) and proclaimed the lead faulty. Kept me waiting then refused the exchange because I didn‚Äôt bring it back within 14 days. Their policy for accessory exchange is 6 months. Had to make a second trip to the store and argue my case with the general manager to get the exchange, yet according to CPWH, there was no shortfall in the service I received.

The member of staff who I saw was visibly stressed, twitchy and possible shaking. I suspected a hangover but I can‚Äôt be sure of that.

Their head office are insisting I hand over my phone to them for at least 14 days so they can investigate, but how can I trust them after they have treated me, and my property with such irreverence? They have also now called me a liar on every point of my complaint. Avoid these people at all costs!",0
"I rang team know how, was in a queue each time between 45 minutes to 1 hour and when it came to my turn the person on the other side cut me off without speaking.

"Still god-awful signal from these lying bags of pig droppings. Any song you want to hear? Best prepare for only 10 to 30 secs of your song before an endless amount of buffering and the song never playing until you get to around 4 feet from your front door and your wifi (not provided by Vodafone) takes over. Lo and behold everything works. Why? Because Vodafone's so called best signal network is one giant lie. At best all my phone gets is around the old max signal for the 3g network signal. Unfortunately, nowadays this won‚Äôt even let you unlock your phone. Great job Vodafone but hey at least you win the WORST mobile signal providers title yet again. That‚Äôs what at least 2 years I‚Äôve been counting? If I really thought about it I think they would be the all time champions for poor signals and lies.",0

"Ordered the stone photo coasters. These were for Christmas pretend so was very disappointed with how badly damaged they were and then having to keep reordering the damaged replacements sent.
initial order was for 3. When they arrived they had all been placed into a Jiffy bag on top of each other. Amazingly only the one arrived broken as the way they were packaged wasn‚Äôt fit for postal transit. They were next to each other without any other wrapping so had been knocking against each other.
Trying to sort the issue through the live chat was a painfully long and frustrating experience. Eventually it was reordered but was a very misleading conversation. I had to keep asking for clarification as to what was being done - a reorder as well as a gesture of goodwill. Not just a credit to reorder myself!
When the replacement coaster arrived it again arrived damaged as it had not been packaged correctly yet again. So again I had to go through the whole process of having to get it again. The pressure of it being a Christmas present added to the frustration and then it didn‚Äôt arrive in time. The whole time a live chat is quite difficult and would much prefer to speak to a real person.
Eventually in the new year the coaster arrived undamaged. Don‚Äôt know now as it was packaged in the same pathetically poor way. Placing a fragile sticker on a thinly bubbled envelope isn‚Äôt good enough for such a delicate fragile item.
Snapfish have left me really disappointed and because of this I wouldn‚Äôt order such items again",0
"I wouldn't even give them one star!! I left now tv as I kept loosing service and there was no help from the customer service team, a full month's payment was taken after my cancellation! I was told I would have to wait a whole month then ring back to get my refund processed.. rang back one month later to be told that I actually didn't have to wait and ring back and that my payment was due to go in.. payment hasn't gone in.. rang back again to be told that it hasn't even been processed and I would now have to wait another week for payment! On top of this I am now being told that I won't get the full amount back as the TV passes are non-refundable even tho the payment should have never gone out in the first place!! I asked to speak to a manager and I was told I was unable to as non were available (apparently he had just left the room) and one would contact me within 72 hours ..

"I had a replacement whirlpool NSWM743UGG washing machine delivered Sunday 23/2/20 by knowhow as part of the recall. The top was broken by the delivery men whilst unpacking it. The plastic lugs securing the top of the machine broke leaving the top loose. Despite talking to many different people from knowhow and whirlpool for over an hour all I am getting is the runaround.
Despite being promised by knowhow customer service department that it will be sorted and that they would contact me I heard nothing. I then waited a week and emailed knowhow customer services and got the usual automated reply ( ref DIX5596489CR ) Twice this has happened now and the latest advising me to take the issue to whirlpool.
What a joke!! They break it and try to fob me off to contact whirlpool.
All I‚Äôm getting is the runaround.
Terrible service and customer service I would give them a score of 0 if I could.

I ordered the platnum + straighteners on the 23rd of December on the morning as the website promised delivery would be before Christmas and i had finally been paid. I chose these straighteners against other competitors for this reason. 8 days later they have finally arrived. I tried to contact GHD but their line is temporarily closed due to COVID and they offered a contact form to fill in and send off which i filled in on the 27th which i still haven‚Äôt received a reply about. Their courier Hermes also doesn't have a contact line nor does their chat assist work. I will never buy through GHD website again as it has caused a lot of undue stress and inconvenience,0
"Didn't allow me to pay the bill person I spoke to - was rude to me I have anxiety so hung up after he said I couldn't pay it as I didn't know what to do, then later that day found out that they cancelled my contract at ¬£80 that left me with a ¬£500.27 bill that got passed to debt collectors within a short period of time.

"At last Openreach arrived in my rural location with fast fibre. I ordered an internet and phone line package a few weeks ago. Today the BT engineer ran the fibre in to my house and connected up the router. He then told me the pole outside my house wasn't getting ""light"" but he'd finished the installation, had told Openreach that there was not ""light"", they'd switch it on as it was just an IT job, and then the router would work definitely by the end of the day, at which he left. As the router didn't start to work by the end of the day I rang BT who now tell me Openreach will have to send an engineer to sort out the pole fittings outside my house, and it could take up to two weeks for a visit. They can let me know what date they can try to fix it on in four days time. How can an organisation sell a service they haven't actually got laid on - and then take weeks to put right their error? And the ""compensation"" for not providing the service they contracted to provide from today is ¬£5 a day - that's is pathetic and will not make BT/Openreach improve their awful service. I didn't believe they were as bad as the reviews say - but I do now.",0
"I bought two straighteners from GHD in the last few years. Every-time I made sure I have registered the product for warranty. First straightener stopped working suddenly, GHD didn‚Äôt want to fix it or replace it because of some small print on their policy. Second one the Platinum one, was last Christmas I bought it for myself. A month ago, a swelling appeared inside the bracket. The product was still working only I was afraid to use it, so I sent it to them. They said I must have done something to it and they won‚Äôt do anything about it. I hope they send it back to me. Everytime they offered 15% off a new straightener but from the existing price. They are only money maker thieves. You will never get support from them. Stay away! Invest in a Dyson!",0

I purchased a refurbished iPhone 7 on 15th January for ¬£122.99 delivery said 14 days (due to covid). I contacted customer services on the 14th day to say we still hadn‚Äôt had any contact regarding delivery. I was told it would be at least another week to wish I replied I would like a refund as the phone was needed urgently (as my Mum was in hospital and her phone wasn‚Äôt charging properly). I was told I would get a full refund within 2 weeks. It is not the 23rd March and I still haven‚Äôt received a refund!!! When I contacted customer services after 2 weeks of waiting for the refund I was told ‚Äòbecause of covid‚Äô I would have to wait until latest 22nd March?? I have now contacted customer services again to chase the refund. Absolutely awful customer services on all fronts - Do not but anything from here folks! I went to another online company and purchased a phone for a similar price and it was delivered in 3 days no hassle.,0

"The delivery drivers in the two times we have used this service have been extremely helpful and professional. The customer service/schedulers on the other hand are abysmal and will lie straight to your face to get you off the phone.

The first washing machine to arrive was smashed to bits, so the driver took it away and the delivery was rescheduled. Bearing in mind people have to take days off to be at home and the only days they can deliver (Mon and Thu for our area), means a second day off of work.

Delivery was promised for the afternoon of the following Monday (something customer service said was more than possible). We then received a text on the preceding Sunday saying it would arrive ""0700-1059"". Funnily enough having booked the afternoon off this wasn't going to work. A quick call to customer service and a boy told us not to worry; he couldn't change the delivery timing right then, but if we phoned back Monday morning at 0800 they could re-shuffle the delivery. Considering the delivery timing start at 0700 we questioned this - ""oh the drivers don't come in until 0800 anyway."" Sounded fishy but what can you do?

Monday morning comes and 0755 we get a call from the driver saying he's minutes away. After explaining what we'd been told he said he'd heard nothing and that they start work at 0630.

Turns out both times we'd called customer service we'd been lied to just to get us off the phone.

Unfortunately the drivers are forced to deal with this cluster and went out of their way to re-shuffle their delivery route to cover for the failings of the customer service office. A shame that they are let down and have to face the disappointed customers whilst those in the office hide away.

In summary, would not recommend relying on this service for consistency or reliability (or the truth). If you can use someone else, do it. But if you take the gamble, once it does arrive it will be installed correctly and to a high standard.",0
"I ordered a tumble dryer that I couldn't collect from the store so it had to be delivered, not a problem except curry's charge me ¬£20 for something I would have preferred to collect myself.

"What a big mistake when my elder mother decided to go with Now Tv. They disconnected her from her previous broadband and phone supplier and left without doing anything, leaving her unable to phone anyone. Believe it or not Now TV started charging her monthly Bill's for absolutely nothing.

They would not sort the problem out and are still stealing her money. What on earth is going on here? This is criminal.",0
I tried changing direct debt on three occasions with the last attempt being successful. I then called up a week later to make sure this had been actioned due to the amount reviews on trustpilot. I was then told by agent that this was not the case and he would extend paying from 25th to 3rd of the month. I have never been with company which is so backwards and don't do what's good for customer. They even charged me extra to change direct debt because they wanted to cancel Mt direct debt.What waste of time with this company may as well speak to brick wall. Please read the reviews before signing up I wouldn't recommend this company!,0

"Terrible customer service, no show on two occasions. We placed our order for wifi on the 10th December and shortly after received confirmation on our account, ¬£5 taken from our account as a holding fee and also confirmation via email for an install on the 12th Jan. A few days prior we are conscious the box has not arrived so we touch base - we are told our order was never confirmed despite them taking money from us which is illegal and they had no details for us. We then rearranged the install date for another 10-14 days from this date. Note we then had to cover our own wifi to WFH which cost us ¬£60 each in hotspot fees. The second date rolls around - 28th Jan. We receive confirmation emails, we receive a call confirming sanitising steps for the engineer and we have received our box. No show. No engineer, no wifi. It is now almost TWO MONTHS since we purchased the wifi and nearly ONE MONTH since our intiial install date. This has been a costly, disappointing and frustrating process. Customer service are slow, unwilling to help and downright indifferent to doing their role to any standard at all. Brendan is especially poor at responding and resolving quite frankly, anything.

"Tried NowTV with lockdown and didn't enjoy it at all. They only let you use thier own player to watch content but it's one of the worst pieces of software I've used in a long time. Clunky, outdated and very often just didn't work. The kicker and what made me cancel though, is that you can't use this on things like the Amazon tv stick, no, Now TV want you to buy their own stick and it just smacks of greed.

I complained and was sent replacements of which 18 were cropped horribly. Contacted customer service who said it was my fault for not positioning the photos on the builder correctly. I hadn‚Äôt been on since they butchered the first lot but somehow, it was me who hadn‚Äôt adjusted the pictures properly.
They kept offering me to go on and adjust the pictures which they would kindly reprint for me. No thanks once bitten, twice shy
Absolute bunch of clowns. Avoid them if your photos are of sentimental things. You‚Äôll only get half the picture",0
"I have been with Three for many years.

I use PAYG as I am chronically ill, disabled and can't work, and therefore have no money.

Up to last year I was on the 321 tariff.
3p a min calls
2p a text
1p per MB of data

It went up last year to:
10p a min calls
10p a text
5p per MB of data

And now from next month it will be:
35p a min calls
15p a text
10p per MB of data

That's a 250% increase from the current tariff!!
Look at it from the year before.

Crazy that in just 2 years we could increase so much and 250% increase in one year alone!

Disgraceful.

No one is as expensive as Three for PAYG now!

Plus the service is pretty bad.

The live chat just tries to get you to upgrade to a contract or says they will give you a PAC code.
They don't listen to anything and just try to get rid of you on the chat if you have issues rather than sorting them.

The coverage is much worse.
I now can't make a call inside and have to go outside even though on the website for coverage, it shows I have 5g and the best service going indoors and out!
That is a lie though as service is shocking!


How they can increase costs 250% and think that is ok, is ridiculous!

Lots of us use PAYG as we can't afford contract!
Stop trying to make everyone move over and stop making PAYG totally out of price range!",0
"If you can see the pathetic response to my earlier review you will understand the problem with Vodaphone.

I signed up to Now Broadband after seeing them on a comparison site. I wish I hadn't.
I waited weeks for the broadband to be set up, and was then told an engineer needed to come out. First, the engineer turned up unannounced and didn't have the right ladder to set us up. The day after, another four engineers arrived and got us sorted.
The internet was good for four days, until it was cut off. When I rang them, it turned out our order hadn't been placed properly, and I was told it would be sorted within 24 hours.
I rang back a day later, and was told actually the whole order needed to be re placed, which would take a week (even though it worked fine one day before).
This was supposed to happen on 27th July. When I phoned to confirm it today (26th), it turns out I'm now booked in for early August.

"I recently purchased an induction range cooker from Marks Electricals, but when the delivery lorry turned up, there was no cooker on board. I then had to call three days running to find out what was going on, each time being told someone would call back that day with an update, which never happened. Finally I was sent an email stating that they were unable to locate the cooker and that it was now out of stock, estimated delivery 4-6 weeks. Which was great as we had had our existing gas cooker disconnected and gas supply capped in anticipation of the new cooker being delivered. We then had the prospect of microwave meals or whatever could be cooked on a camping stove. At no point did Marks offer any apology for the inconvenience caused.

Fortunately the new cooker came into stock quicker than the estimate. However when this was delivered, the back door of our house was damaged. To be fair, the delivery guy did not try to hide this and took a photo for evidence. I would also say that one delivery guy was very good, the other spent most of his time on the phone sorting out his financials and was pretty reluctant to help his colleague.

I then reported the damaged door to Marks with a photo. I got an email back several days later asking if I still wanted to progress this, which I replied to saying I did. I then heard nothing. I rang Marks towards the end of last week to see what was going on and was told someone would call back. Well, surprise surprise I am still waiting‚Ä¶

I would say if you use the this company and have a no-issues delivery, you will be very pleased with their next day delivery and good prices. HOWEVER, if you have any issues, do not expect to get any responses without huge effort on your part. Their customer service when things go wrong is pretty poor and I would suggest you go elsewhere unless you are prepared to take the risk.

I will be chasing Marks re our back door, but it would be nice if someone from Marks actually read this and took some action‚Ä¶",0

Are you hankering for the good old days of internet dial up. Then look no further than three for all your mobile needs. This companies network is a joke.!!! Do yourselves a favour and do not sign up with this company for your contract. I've had a year of misery and another year to go. I'm a truck driver and travel all over the country and it's in so many places this network is poor. During phone calls the other person cant not hear you or you can't hear them. Calls cut off all the time. Texts often delayed. And the mobile internet is an absolute joke. Your phone will tell you it's 4 g + or 5 g and yet you can't even view pictures in the likes of Facebook or they take so long to load that it's just totally frustrating. It's not my phone because I've tried two. It's not my SIM because I've had a replacement. There is something inherently wrong with this company's network so avoid avoid avoid at all costs and save yourself a load of frustration. I've Tried them all and Vodafone is the best.

"I ordered a Samsung Galaxy Note20 phone on the 13th October for the next available delivery date which was the 15th October.
I hadn't received any update to advise that the phone would be delivered so I contacted customer services via online chat.
When querying where my phone was, their response was:
'I managed to check on your order and I can see that upon additional verification the order has been declined and has been requested to be returned to ourselves. Unfortunately, we are unable to specify the exact reasons for declining the transaction. As you have paid an upfront cost of 749.99 this will be refunded back to you once we have processed the device back into our warehouse.'

When I asked when I'd receive my refund, they stated it'd be 3-5 working days after the device had been received back into the warehouse. I'm confused as to how it's even left the warehouse if the order has been declined?

So they've been unable to confirm what the exact issue was, but have been happy and able to take almost ¬£750 out of our bank account and tell us that it can take up to a week for us to get it back.

I advised the customer service representative to pass on feedback to the relevant department to ensure that a customer is made aware if an order can't be processed or a delivery isn't possible. I was writing a further response when the representative ended the conversation.

Poor communication from a company who is well established and should have better processes in place. No empathy from customer services and no desire to even get an answer for you.

"They are absolutely clueless on the email products they supply - namely mailplus.

I did this, but only my main email continued to work with IMAP. I tried to login to my talktal account to see what the problem was and I could not access it anymore. Talktalk tod me that that was correct. They could not help me to access my other email accounts. Also, I could not have any access to my account to see billing details or anything. Disgraceful. The only way I could access my other emails was via webmail. In desperation I registerd one of the other accounts with mailplus and low and behold - it worked at the cost of another ¬£5 per month. The mailplus is supposed to allow you up to 5 email accounts which you administer through myaccount which you can no longer access.

After setting up the direct debit, I was told an engineer will come and set the Wi-Fi up on the 28th of October (today) between 8am and 1pm and that they will need someone to be present in the flat at the time. I made arrangements for someone to give up their day and wait in the flat for the engineer whilst myself and my partner were at work. We had received 3 text reminders about our appointment... one of them being less than 24 hours before the appointment itself. My friend waited in our flat ALL day and said no one turned up. No one contacted me, no texts no calls no emails.. NOTHING. So I rang OpenReach who were meant to be fitting it and could not get through to a real person. I then rang Shell up and had to wait an hour and a half to get through to someone, when I finally did, they barely spoke English and did not help at all, all they did was tell me it had been cancelled. I said called when? they did not answer and just repeated that it was cancelled. I said what now? she said wait for someone to call me to rearrange. I then, 3 hours later, receive a generic email stating that our set up appointment has been 'rearranged' for 30th of November. OVER an ENTIRE MONTH away from the original date. That's 6 weeks wait time just to get set up when we are living in a flat where we receive no phone service. No chance. The absolute cheek of this company.

So I tool up a deal for a one off payment of ¬£50 for 6 month movie and entertainment pass, which I thought was a pretty good deal since they would cost me ¬£11.99 and ¬£7.99 respectively per month as standard. As I made a one off payment and not did not set up a direct debit I thought my service would end after 6 months. But no...they then started taking monthly payments at the standard rate by direct debit, even though I had not set up a direct debit with them. Isn‚Äôt this illegal?? They keep emailing me the same thing every time I email them for a refund, that there is an auto renewal small print which I must have accepted if I accepted their T‚Äôs and C‚Äôs. But if I made a one off payment how can they use my card to set up a direct debit without my consent? This is the question I keep asking them and they cannot give me a response.

"I've been a Vodafone user for 23 years, and my awful experience this month has made me decide to terminate my mobile phone and home broadband contracts and take my business elsewhere. I've been having an ongoing issue with my broadband connection, which in itself is annoying, but I understand this could happen with any provider. It's the way Vodafone has dealt with it from a customer service point of view that is totally unacceptable.

Vodafone has failed me so many times that I've lost count. The service has been incredibly disorganised. Once an advisor arranged a specific date and time to call me and didn't; twice I've made formal requests to speak with a manager and was promised that one would call within 24-48 hours, but no one called. There is no accountability whatsoever. By keeping to their word and calling they would have made things a little easier for me at a time when I'm already having a problem, instead I've had to essentially chase Vodafone to get the issue resolved. The total lack of respect for customers' time is truly shocking.

Calling from scratch means going through the painful automated phone system all over again. This automated system has today become unbearable. For at least 3-5 minutes each time you are asked to enter your account number, date of birth etc. then when you finally get through to a human you are asked to repeat all of this again, so I really don't know what the point is. The automated voice also constantly repeats that it's easier and quicker to chat with their A.I. system online. No, Vodafone, we loyal customers want to speak with human beings, when will you finally realise this?

I work from home and my broadband was completely down for five days (three of which were business days, causing me huge problems) at the beginning of this month. Zero connection. An engineer visited on 5 Sept. and managed to reconnect my line, but my connection now drops multiple times each day and my speed is below the minimum guaranteed speed. Vodafone booked an engineer to visit on Sunday 25 Sept. and I stayed home for the entire six hour time-slot and no one showed up (and the engineer didn't call me either).

After calling Vodafone and having to go through the tedious automated phone system again, then explain all the background information to a new advisor all over again, a new appointment was made for today, 27 Sept. Again, I stayed at home for the entire six hour time-slot but the engineer didn't show up and didn't call again. I had even called Vodafone halfway through my time-slot to confirm that my appointment was definitely booked in for today (I was starting to get a nasty feeling no one would come).

So I had to call Vodafone again this evening and go through the entire process again. This time I had to wait in a queue for 30+ minutes for an advisor to answer the phone. When I finally got through, the advisor claimed that my pin - the same one that has been accepted on the countless calls I've made to Vodafone this month - is wrong. Probably a technical error with Vodafone's system because the same pin has been accepted so many times previously. The advisor claimed she couldn't continue the call with me because my pin was incorrect and I mentioned that a few hours previously the same thing had happened and another advisor was able to get me through security questions without my pin, but she insisted that she couldn't proceed. The call dropped while we were speaking and the agent didn't bother to call me back. I know after so many phone calls this month that advisors are trained to call you back if the call drops. This perfectly illustrates why I say customer service has been incredibly inconsistent. With one agent I was able to pass security without my pin, a few hours later another agent insisted it wasn't possible. Some agents call back if a call gets cut off, others don't.

Tonight my 45+ minute phone call was all for nothing and I will have to waste even more of my time tomorrow calling Vodafone yet again.

From my experience this month, Vodafone's customer service has gone seriously downhill. It is the worst it has ever been in my 23 years as a user and I am not willing to accept it.

--- UPDATE ---
Thanks for your response, but it isn't good enough. If you were serious about investigating the many failings that have occurred, you ought to make the effort to contact me (thereby making it a little easier for me) instead of asking me to (yet again) contact Vodafone. In my review I've explained how much of my time has been wasted already and in response you ask me to contact you via Facebook or Twitter, are you serious? Do you honestly think that is the right way to deal with a customer who has been inconvenienced so many times already, will it be efficient for me to tweet you and then wait for your response? Pathetic ""service"".",0
"To be fair I wouldn‚Äôt give this company a one star, but had to just to leave another review. Ordered a phone early June, it took forever to come and when it did it was certainly not up to standard. I returned it to the company as I thought there was an issue with the camera for it to take four weeks to be returned with no resolution. I then took the phone to a local technician tonight 29.7.20, for him to tell me that it isn‚Äôt the camera but a very poor quality screen that was placed on the phone. Quite simple really. Would never use this company again or recommend. After reading this review I strongly recommend NOT to ever use this company.",0
"Really bad company, signed up for the basic package and was being charged for sky sports and boost which I never signed up for. Showed all the paper work to prove what I had signed up for and somehow all these extras got added to my package without my consent and were unwilling to give me a full refund. I won‚Äôt be renewing my contract with now tv again",0
"Now TV started at 8.99/m for movies, then slowly increased their price to 10.99/m for the same service.

Then they decided to introduce ads in their paid service, when questioned they told me I can purchase a ""boost"" for ¬£5 a month which gets rid of ads and makes the resolution 1080p.

In comparison, no other streaming service has ads in their paid subscriptions, 1080p is standard on all other streaming services with Disney+ and Amazon offering 4K HDR as standard on selected TV/Movies. Netflix offers 4K HDR for a small extra payment.

All this brings every other streaming service in at a lower or equal cost as Now TV, with TV/Movies included in all of them except now TV, 4K HDR on all of them except Now TV, multiple devices as standard except Now TV, with the only thing Now TV can now offer is a higher price for an all round inferior service, for a total of ¬£25 a month for TV/Movies with all other services coming in at ¬£9.99 or less for an all round more comprehensive service.",0
"i think i have broken my own record for the time taken trying to get through to team knowhow on the phone, I am still trying to get my money back on an item which was promised weeks ago. I have been phoning everyday for over 3 weeks, same thing every time, put on hold for an hour or more, listening to a tedious music on hold loop. then after maybe 2 hours the phone rings but nobody answers, until it goes dead after another hour or so. or your directed through to a dead phone line.

Today i rang at 845am and at 5pm an incredible 9 hours later, I'm still in a phone queue waiting to be dealt with. Off course Team knowhow will reply saying ""that due to covid 19 they have received an exceptional volume of phone calls"" or other such rubbish.

"I brought my iPhone SE to the Carphone Warehouse Stratford branch on 18/01/2020 to have the battery replaced. The operation took two hours to complete. When I returned home I found that the side volume buttons had ceased working and that I could not switch the phone to Vibrate or Silent mode. Even when I adjust the phone's settings the Vibrate and Silent modes will not function.
I returned the next day to complain and have the problem rectified only to be told that I would have to return the following Tuesday as that is when the engineer who worked on my phone would be working. This was now my second wasted trip to Stratford.
I returned on Tuesday, 21/01 as I was told and the engineer who worked on my phone looked at it again. After I waited for an hour I was told that the phone would have to be sent to Apple to either be repaired or replaced, and that this could take up to two weeks. They gave me a replacement phone to use in the meantime, which is a barely functional Alcatel. I have now wasted 49 pounds and several hours of my time, only for my phone to be in worse condition than it was in when I started the repair process. I am deeply frustrated and dissatisfied with the treatment I have received. And I have to waste more of my time going to collect the phone once it is returned by Apple.
When I told the engineer who worked on my phone that I expect some compensation or a refund he told me that it wouldn't happen because that's not the way it works. I still expect some form of compensation from the company for the time and money they have cost me.",0

I DON'T WANT ONE!! Now I've got to give them 30 days notice, I think I'm out of contract anyway. Hum ho, gladly pay an extra month to be rid of these incompetents.

Then on 25 August it just failed completely, with a screen notice saying "" Sorry now tv is currently unavailable"". I went to their site and found it just kept sending me round in circles. They really do not want to let you get through to a person. Eventually after 4 days, I managed to submit a complaint. Next day I got a reply which allocated me a case number and asked a couple of questions. I answered those promptly but then complete silence. I have sent 4 more emails and had absolutely no response.

"For the past eight months, Three has been providing me a service where, out of their whims and to pursue their goals, they straight up SHUT the internet connection for hours, or days, in one case for WEEKS, without any notice whatsoever (other than a website where I have to go which tells me ""We‚Äôre performing network upgrades in your area
We're sorry for any disruption you're experiencing. But you‚Äôll be able to enjoy a better, stronger network very soon. As part of The Big Network Build, we‚Äôre making a significant investment in our network to bring you an improved 4G network, and new 5G infrastructure.""

This started in December 2021, and now I am told that it will continue at least until December 2022 according to them. So one straight year of unreliable, unusable for at least 40% of the time, service. Minimum!!!

I complained to the Ombudsman and the answer was that their T&C allow this to happen, so they can't do anything.

So let me say this straight: you would be entering a contract with a company that provides internet services, and said contract also authorises them to SHUT the connection whenever they want to, for no reason other than pursuing their own ""Big network plans"", without any repercussion whatsoever, without any notice, without even the hint of an apology.

I don't know how this is legal, but apparently it is. So it's up to you to wisen up and avoid Three.

Imagine if your energy company, or water company, could just do this.

Edit: Three answered my review... with more lies. First of all, I won't see any ""improvement"" soon, as they have confirmed to the Ombudsman that this will be going on until at least December. Second: no, you won't do all you can to get this sorted. Before escalating to the Ombudsman, I had been asking for eight months to receive at least some notice of when my internet connection would become unreliable (since this is being caused by PLANNED WORK, at least notify us). Nothing ever happened.

"If you're considering this internet provider, let me advice you: Don't bother, they're horrendous. Sure, everything works nice and fine when there's no issues, but I guarantee you, there'll be issues and their contract is like a pair of handcuffs. Initial appealing deal, as soon as it expires, it doubles up your monthly payment and if you renegotiate it, you'll re-start your two-year contract again. Moving houses? it re-starts your 2-year contract again.

They can, and they will, one-sided cancel your contract, will say it was a mistake on their part and still cut you off. Their customer service is horrendous.

We've learned a lot during the now 2nd year (restarted as we moved houses) and as soon as our contract is over, we are leaving (thank God!) and never looking back to this disastrous of a provider.",0

1. Curries don‚Äôt allow you to cancel orders online. It‚Äôs 2020! Everyone else does this!

2. You need to call ‚ÄúTeam Know Nothing‚Äù. When you do, there is no option for ‚ÄúCancelling orders‚Äù; so you need to select the ‚ÄúDeliveries‚Äù option, then ‚ÄúOther‚Äù. Ask for Helen, she‚Äòll put you on hold for an hour every time!

3. After the 3rd or 5th call, and not speaking to anyone that can actually help, you‚Äôll eventually hang up and wonder why you bothered dealing with Curries in the first place... Write a reminder to punch yourself in the face should you should you ever be redirected to the Curries website.. This should remind you of how painful the customer service experience was... If you find yourself wanting to visit the website voluntarily, schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist - you may have had a mental breakdown.

"If I could give no stars I would!
I have been with Vodafone for many years and never really had any problems up until last year.
It started off with my payment being taken out early which led me to be in a little bit of debt. They then bouned back the payment which I went to pay on the app when I could.
I then got a letter from the debt collector with a large amount i needed to pay from Vodafone? when I came to question them on it, they said its because i missed a payment and then they add on a fee for no payments, this is all because i paid through the app once and then doing that stops your direct debts? I hop on the chat to try and sort this out and after about 2 hours an agreement was made. I then started to see payments coming out on different days and when i came to try and sort it out, i was being past around to every person and felt like nothing was getting sorted. With any problems i have, i feel like they always get shut down and resolved in the fastest but worst way. The waiting on the phone and the chats is awful! Getting a 5G network should of been so much better. But no. I hardly get 5G anywhere and it is still slow as anything but when I brought this up they give me a list of things to try, which I did but none of them helped ( no surprise ). When i came to bring up i want to cancel my contract they try anything in their power to get you to stay, why only then do they want to help you? Then when you tell them all the problems you have had and they still smack you with the cancellation fee ??? Why should I have to pay that after all the problems I have had?
STAY AWAY.
There are no benefits to this network and all I feel like is I am going round in circles with them all. I know people who have got air pods added on and little other things. When I ask if there was anything I can add it was a simple No from them and I got turned away.

update - i was on a chat someone was at the door and now the chat is disconnected now im NUMBER 59 IN QUE!!!!!!

"The engineer was not enthusiastic and was looking for any excuse to avoid carrying out the work.

The engineer called me the (Landlord) on Monday 4th January 2021 at 7:30am and said he will arrive at 8:00am with a private number.

I told him he could park either in the two side streets. To which he replied "" I do not want to park too far and walk along way"" I told him it was not far walk from the house and the alternative is you could park opposite the house on a closed shops driveway.

Then I told him, ""just knock the door there are plenty of tenants living in the property and they will give you access."" To which he replied, ""how many people live there?"" ""I said 8"" he said ""we do not cover that much people!"" I said we have two kitchens as two washing machines. Then he said I will be there at 8:00am.

I realised this engineer is going to be difficult so I called one of my tenants and told him to wait at the door around 7:50am. At 8:01am I receive a call from the engineer saying, ""I am knocking and no one is answering I am leaving!"" I live only a few doors away, so I jumped out of bed and ran a few doors down in my pyjamas and I see the engineer waiting at 169 Wells Road instead of 167 Wells Road. I told him ""you are knocking at the wrong address"" to which he replied ""I am at the right address"". I then told him 167 Wells Road is next door, he then replied and went there. When he went inside and saw a sign on the washing machine saying, do not use water is not draining and it may overflow out onto the floor. He said ""I am not going to fix this as I wasn't told anything about this!"" The first tenant was an Indian man, but after the second tenant who was English came and explained that ""we had reported the water not draining from the washing machine"" he then listened to him and carried out the work by taking out the filter which he damaged whilst opening due to it being so stiff. He then replaced it with a new one and left.

We believe this engineer to be prejudice towards to myself and my tenants who are both Indian and Pakistani descent. He was not at all enthusiastic about his job and was just looking for any excuse not carry out the work. Totally unacceptable behaviour from a professional engineer!

Therefore we would be looking for another company to cover our appliances.",0

I then complained again stating it was their own hub and the charge was then reversed only to see it being taken by direct debit.

I am not happy so I have now cancelled my direct debit with this company and waiting for them to react and take them to the disputes body as I have all the evidence and facts and know I will not only win but will no longer trade with a company that cheats it's own customers. Good luck to them if this is their attitude towards their own equipment and charges being waived and then being taken out again. I cannot see them lasting long at this rate!

Even after copying in the content of their own email as follows I was told a completely different thing again just like the first time and becomes apparent that the staff do not read their emails and have exactly the same blanket policy !

My father would turn in his grave knowing his half a century of loyalty meant nothing but would also feel saddened that my mother will be closing the account before it hits 50 years because unlike BT, he was a man of principal and would've said ""I only use BT and they'll give a little something here and there for being a loyal customer"" - how wrong you were dad.

I unpacked the dishwasher opened the door and where the door is crooked it has cracked and bent the metal where the hinge is getting caught. There are fingerprints inside the dishwasher so obviously it has either A) already been returned by a customer and repacked and fobbed off onto someone else or B) the fingerprints are from the quality control team who saw the issue and just packed it off anyway. I had to get someone to wait for the delivery as I work and today am told by argos the next available weekend date, guaranteed,for them to collect their junk is the 3rd December. They have absolutely no regard for their customers. So much for customer service. They don't give a hoot about the customers, just sell us junk and don't go out of their way to rectify it. It's appalling. I'll never shop at argos again.",0
I bought a pay as you go sim and I paid the ¬£10 big value bundle so I ring to active it and they didn‚Äôt active it they put it on my top up money on my account not my data so I asked them about this and they said we can‚Äôt help you so they gave me 500mb because they couldn‚Äôt active it absolutely apporling. The person taking my call was may and she was laughing as I was telling her the situation disgusting!,0
"Talk Talk is a joke. I don't understand why City Fibre chose them as provider because the customer service is the worst! 99% of the time you're on hold for hours. The customer service is either rude, confused or don't understand English. They breached the contract and did not send me the router so now I have no broadband and random holes in my walls which the engineer left. The customer service is non-existent, are they recieving calls from outer space? I don't recommend this provider as they are the worst on Earth and you will hugely regret this decision. They have wasted hours of my time so beware!",0
Staff nice to your face but fill you full of lies to get a sale. Now can't get refund cos it's company policy even though I haven't had any goods or service from them. Just sit and wait and report the transaction to Visa and trading standards. I was told I was confirming identity by chip and pin and no payment would be taken but was actually charged ¬£170. Lesson learned don't shop with them again.,0
"The audacity to issue a 50% price hike to watch on demand and ""ad free"" is bad enough. For 15 quid a month I'd at least expect an ipad/iphone app that doesn't crash on a regular basis and the ability to skip the lacklustre trailers for content I have no interest. Made the mistake of going back as there a few shows I wanted to catch-up on but have cancelled again - the viewing experience is absolutely not worth the money.",0
Still waiting for a refund that was promised back in October (after months of chasing). This has still not arrived and I am told the same thing every time I call that the cheque will be with me in two weeks. I questioned the adviser as to why I couldn't be paid by bank transfer as this is what I had been told two weeks prior and she hung up the phone on me.,0
"i have been with this company for last over 10 year and since i took two more contract for my high school going kids they billed me more even though i had spending cap on them today 27th may spoke to a their customer service team the guy name RANDHEER . had horrible horrible experience with him also he hanged up
today 9th june they generated my new bill and they falsely charged me extra 157 pounds even though i have spending cap 0¬£ so nothing should be charged extra",0
I wish there was a zero or negative score that I could give rather than one star! An absolutely rubbish network provider. Terrible customer service absolutely incompetent staff. I have never ever experienced anything like this in my whole life of having phone and broadband contracts. DO NOT JOIN THEM. If u get any problems they will literally torture you with unlimited agonising hours and days and months of calling with no proper solution if not added more trouble!!,0
"Phoned Three to cancel contract and was told that when I transferred the number to new contract that would close my contract with them, but just got a bill for used time and early termination fee, not mentioned when I phone just added to the bill, very poor Comms will never go back to three.",0
Delivered wrong order twice completely useless I really wouldn't use them again,0
"This company without doubt is the worst ever! Once my contract is up, it will be good riddance!",0
"I got to the end of my contract and tried to upgrade, I couldn‚Äôt log in to my account online, it was down so I had to call the call centre, they were useless, couldn‚Äôt even access my account, after 25 minutes I gave up and have now left three, they must lose so much business this way, the guy on the phone didn‚Äôt seem to care and was just argumentative, I will be moving all of my other phones away from three now too, they are too much hassle to deal with.",0
"Product was listed as available for next day delivery, but didn't hear from the installation company for two days, so that made that a lie. When I did hear from the installation company, it was through a message that contained a link for a survey to ensure installation could go ahead. Failed the survey and phoned the given phone number. Got through to a lady who said I'd selected the wrong option and needed to use option 6. Did this, started to explain the situation, only to be informed I was speaking to the same lady, apparently both options go to the same switchboard. Said installation should be OK, but she'd get someone to call me back. Never heard back, so tried for a week to get through to someone to confirm that the installation could go ahead, but the person I needed to speak to was never available. Sent a message directly to appliances direct, but didn't hear back. Eventually got through to someone willing to confirm installation could go ahead, but only on a Thursday. Couldn't do that Thursday, work etc, so agreed to the following Thursday. My brother booked a day off work so that he could house sit and let the installation guys in etc. 9:30pm the day before the installation, get a text message from a guy named sully saying he won't be able to the installation as he's sick. Nothing from either company saying what would happen next.

Went onto appliances direct and asked for a refund, said they'd be in touch within 24 hours, but instead seem to be ghosting me, so going to have to raise a dispute via the credit card company.

Complete waste of time, during which they've had my money in their account for a month.",0
Delivery via DPD was shockingly late and long. No apology,0
Unfortunately I‚Äôve been waiting for about 12 days and they still haven‚Äôt arrived. I‚Äôve tried to get in touch with ghd and I‚Äôm waiting for a response. I‚Äôm hoping they will get here for Christmas!,0
"I ordered an iphone 8 from them and after a month they still had not sent out the product, they then tried to ignore my request for a refund by saying they will dispatch the item, then when I finally got them to agree to a refund they have said it will take 6-8 weeks to process my refund, this company is a joke and treats their customers badly, I personally will never use this company ever again.

It has now been almost 10 weeks since I ordered the item and 8 weeks since I asked for my refund and I have still not received my money back. The way this company operates surely cant be legal.",0
worst company ever!!! Cancelled contract in March and still been charging me and when I rang back in they said they can‚Äôt cancel it and I have to go in store and pay a termination fee!!!! Never believe a word they say crap service,0
"Bought a Currys Washing Machine, paid for 5 years of a yearly valet service back in 2019. So far managed to get just 1 service despite now 2022... usual covid excuses. Last time had to wait ?month+ to actually get a date. So tried to arrange in advance to actually get a yearly service as paid for - told nope have to wait til past the year before I can even start to arrange - seems ?deliberate to stop you actually getting yearly?",0
"‚ÄúHi Elisabeta. Great News! Your Studio account has been set up with a credit limit of ¬£300. To check how much you have available to spend, login to My Account at studio.co.uk‚Äù
I couldn‚Äôt access my account, and for 2 months I‚Äôve been emailing Studio customer service in order to sort out my issue, they said they see no issue. However , this credit I made for my son‚Äôs Christmas present ( game console ), I called them and I place the order on the phone, my order has been successful !!!! Three days before Christmas I called to ask for a tracking number ( luckily I did that) , the answer I received is that my account is under review ?!?!? So my order is not coming .. which basically for my family means Santa Claus is not coming! They could have emailed me earlier, but it didn‚Äôt happened!",0
"Update :
We have been contacted by a manager and he promised to solve to problem. We have been told , they will replace our product but don‚Äôt have any in stock at the moment so we have to wait if we want exactly the same brand and type of fridge freezer. It was 3 weeks since , nobody called to offer the replacement even though it shows the product is back in stock !

Will chase them up again !
So far only empty promises!


We bought Samsung fridge freezer from ME on 23rd December and spend ¬£2800 - as my old one broke down and I needed replacement asap as all the xmas food shopping was coming in on 24th

ME delivered next day which was great ! but but ‚Ä¶we had to wait till evening to plug it in. One it was in place we realised one of the doors was a bit dropped ( only about 5mm) but for that amount of money I want to have my product 100%
So we took pictures, contacted ME and waited They emailed once they will contact the supplier
Then nothing ‚Ä¶
Eventually we heard back from ME on 3rd January ( I understand there was a lot of bank holidays) only to tell us we need to call Samsung ourself even though on website it says, they contact suppliers if it‚Äôs fault reported within 30 day!

Today 4th January My husband spent hours on the phone , it was hard to get through , they told us if they send someone to fix it we might need to pay for this !!?? My husband was furious and then they said they will call back later that afternoon and nobody did!
Since we contacted ME with the issue the doors dropped slightly more , and really nobody want to deal with this kind of costumer service

I regret now I didn‚Äôt listen to my husband and didn‚Äôt buy from John Lewis, but I wanted to give a chance to some other company

We hope to talk to a manger or someone who is actually willing to help us to resolve this issue, and replace the item",0
"Not had a signal in my local home village for over a year. Called customer service who have done all the trouble shooting and done everything possible to try to get my phone to work. Nothing helped my only option is is cancel my contract, they wanted ¬£500 as a early cancelling fee. I don't see why i should have to pay anything due to not getting the service I'm paying for. Customer service offered me a ¬£250 reduction in this but i still feel this is not good enough.
If i didn't have WIFI in my home and a home phone i would have no way to contract anyone the minute i entered my own home.
I'm now stuck with a phone contract cause i don't see why i should be paying to get out of a contract that they not even providing.
i know I'm not only one who has a problem in my local village with Vodafone.
Roll on December when i can leave the worst mobile provider i have ever had.",0
"Terrible customer service

I had attempted to cancel the service several times and believed this had been sorted the first time I called in. It had not. Turns out they had been charging me ¬£25 a month for over a year despite me calling in so many times to cancel.

They took the charges out on separate days in the month which made it even harder to detect. I tried their online service and asked multiple times to be put through to a manager as nobody had attempted to help. I had also asked for my complaint to be backdated to the first time I had been in touch, no word of that at all. Each time I was cut off so I had to explain the full issue again. There is no number to call so don‚Äôt even try.

I was essentially told off for not cancelling properly when I called in to ask them to do this for me to make sure it was finalised. I have not used the service for over a year and my complaint has been ignored. At a loss at what to do and I feel so hopeless at this point. I barely have enough to get by. I can‚Äôt imagine how many people are surely going through the same issue as me.",0
"Over the course of 3 live chats, Three had somehow managed to put me on a new sim deal that I never asked for, wanted a ¬£190 cancellation fee for that contract that I didn't ask for, were rude, and had the audacity to try and upsell me more sim deals on the way out. Never had such a pisstake in customer service in my life.",0
"Would give the Shell Energy minus five stars if it was possible!
Absolutely useless company with non-existent customer support.
Keep sending increasingly larger and larger demands for non-existent consumption and now threatening with damaging my credit score.
Whilst totally ignoring my meter reads supported with digital photos of the reads which always carry date stamps ‚Äì every read I submit is marked as 'invalid'.
Absolutely shocking company which everyone should stay away from!

UPDATE:
The response from Shell does not address my concern at all!!! I am complaining about my by digital date stamped photos verified meter readings are ignored and marked as 'invalid'. Shell makes totally wild estimates and then bases their demand for payment on these.
And now there want me to set up a DD so they can just take my money from my account at their will ... Yeah sure, just as the day follows the night.
Sorry Shell, once you manage to read my messages and complains word for word, look at the evidence I keep sending regarding the meter reads, understand and digest, then we will have a base for getting a solution.

UPDATE:
Now Shell are virtually indicating that I am a liar, making up stories and doctoring photos of meter readings. They will not accept the readings and their time/date stamps whilst at the same time they are not able to provide any evidence that their figures ‚Äì simply pulled out of the hat ‚Äì are correct. First they provided an opening readings numbers much higher than actual, when I gave the actual readings they were not accepted and that is when the trouble started. When they realised that their first figures were too high (and they would be at a loss) they made up much lower opening reading which they marked as 'customer read' (but no physical person gave them these ‚Äì they were just a fantasy numbers made up by them). And since those fantasy numbers we have not moved an inch. They can't provide an iota of evidence for their figures, whilst I am providing more than enough for mine but they just reply every time with more bullying and intimidation.
The way they treat me is beyond rude! This is an absolutely worst experience I had in my entire life with any company. Their bullying tactics should be subjected to a thorough investigation and they should be shown as the worst example of a total lack of customer care ‚Äì if anything, they are the best example of a customer intimidation.",0
