"I couldn't make an official review on a product on the app so I came here, my mum bought my son an inflatable chair, it's very small, it deflates itself and eventually ends up with a hole in it, twice this has happened as my mum bought another to replace the first and yet again deflates itself and a hole was made in the exact same place coincidently. Its a bad product anyone who reads this remember ""paw patrol inflatable chair"" I expect products from argos to be more sustainable guess not...",0
"Fantastic! Extremely easy to use website, fantastic range of batteries, fantastic packaging , dispatch and delivery service and all of that at fantastic prices! A first class company to deal with üëç",1
So far annoyed as hell with this bt monthly pass. Its not easy as abc to get the app on TV. I want to watch on TV not on my phone. Not everyone is computer clever. Cant wait to cancel the damn thing. Why can't it be easy .,0
Correct replacement delivered on time now my vac is working again Thank you,1
"Now Tv have the worst Broadband, it has gotten progressively worse and they refuse to up their quality. Do not join their services",0
"Everything happened as you said, delivery great and on time, cannot fault whatsoever and will use again.",1
"Quick and fast delivery. Website was easy to use, had no issues and came next day with free delivery.",1
This is by far the most shocking experience I‚Äôve ever had. I am a disabled person who made and order from Wing stop. Just like the many other orders I‚Äôve made over the years. Today the courier couldn‚Äôt get through to me? Even though I was in! They said they tried and tried. So they left the food outside. Who on earth leaves food outside. And to make things worse Deliveroo refuse to refund me for food I didn‚Äôt get. Sadly i dont have the funds for this. So am leaving this to warn people of this shocking and unacceptable behaviour Shame on you! Courier 1928 PS this is not a dis on WingStop. They‚Äôre Excellent .just dont use Deliveroo!!!!!!!!,0
Easy instructions to follow on site & very efficient service. Quick delivery & good quality product,1
"Very pleasant experience today with both customer service and Tech support, Have had a couple of issues over the two years when speaking to customer service, but they have just been poorly trained or bad at the job!. 95% if the time it's 5 star service. Certainly compared to BT and Vodafone which are both terrible. Have renewed for another year hopefully will be hassle free again üôÇ",1
"Fast hassle free. Mean what they say and say what they mean. Would definitely recommend and will use them in the future.

Nice website. Easy to find what you want. Competitive pricing. Swift delivery. Careful packaging. Detailed installation instructions. Excellent after-sales support in the unlikely event it is needed.,1

"My Son‚Äôs 1st birthday invites are absolutely fantastic. You do some really good products that are priced well. The turnaround time and dispatch time were excellent. My only slight issue is the personalisation tool online isn‚Äôt always very user friendly, it can take a while to use.",1

"More than a month after a technical fault in my area, I am still without a phone line or broadband. I've been on the phone more than a dozen times with them. BT keep giving me ""expected fix dates"", but no one ever shows up. I understand that these things may take time, but the constant lying is deplorable.",0

"Still waiting for my refund, 25th day now and still nothing; can refunds escalated contact me asap.

"Worst repair company with a big name, I am getting a pair of headphones repaired which are faulty again after they was sent off for repair to team knowhow, these headphones where brought in on the 07/09/20 and was due for return on the 15/09/20, i received a text on the 14/09/20 stating they have arrived so I went to collect them, they was not there, the customer service assisant basically said they might come tomorrow wait for a call. that was literally all the help I got. she didn't make a call to enquire or do any work to help provide any actual information she just sent me away, so my time and money was wasted. upon trying to call to enquire as the tracking code on the text didn't work (which is 5p minute I may add) you will find every option on the call service for repairs will lock you off once you get to the end so it is literally there to drink your money while you think your waiting for help. as of today 19/09/20 I have received no help and have even tweeted them to try to get some actual assistance which they asked for a ref number which turns out the one they provided in the text doesn't work for me or them. currently I'm in a position where they have my product indefinitely with no date or information on when they will be ready...be careful when getting the breakdown cover when the product cost enough to be sent away Usually on a ¬£200+ product, it may be better to use a different company for repairs then teamknow how.",0
I'm very happy happy with my purchase and how easy everything was to get done.,1
"I would never use this company again .
I ordered from Ireland an iPhone 6S in good condition .I duly paid the cost of postage to ship it here .
Quick fix claim that all their phones are all checked out before despatch .
This handset must have been the one to slip through the net as its not fit for purpose . Battery has major issues and after all the advise by email from quickfix customer service as to methods to fix the problem it's the same .battery won't hold a charge and after hrs of charging with a genuine apple charger it's flat in 10 mins
Then it's got 30% then 10% all over the place !!!!this phone should NEVER!!! BEEN SENT OUT LIKE THIS .
My issue is that they want me to cover the postage costs both ways for them to check it out .,(something possibly that should have already been done ?) From Ireland .
I already paid postage to have it sent here based on their false description of condition - absolutey disgracefully !!
Shame on you and a waste of my money .",0
I was pleasantly surprised - they l communicate well and phone was as described,1
"Got a great deal, delivery was quicker than expected.",1
"They charge 5 a day for overseas data, beware! I paid 150 cause I was working remotely for a month, ID and Virgin are not charging a penny for that!",0

"Very disappointed with ebuyer my son ordered some very expensive computer equipment and paid extra for delivery the company that were supposed to deliver it well that was a absolute joke and have no regard for people property the Items arrived late at first we thought they had been stolen only to find that they had been delivered to my next door neighbours garden fence that been placed on the fence and left for two days in torrential rain, this matter isn‚Äôt over by a long shot and I will be contacting trading standards, all ebuyer have told my son that there looking into haven‚Äôt even offered to refund the delivery cost, whst a joke.",0
Don't do it. Utter garbage. Identified an internal fault as my internet was constantly dropping out. Arranged an engineer visit then closed my case the day before and no engineer visited. I've come to the conclusion you can save money by opting for a crap provider like these but the 20p a day you save is simply not worth it.,0
Arthur M was very informative and helpful with my query and sent me an email confirmation of our conversation.,1
"Avoid avoid please
Three times my food didn‚Äôt arrived,i was waiting outside for the drivers and they didn‚Äôt stop and after they said the couldn‚Äôt deliver my food,i contact them they said they can‚Äôt give my money back because i didn‚Äôt answer the phone,i ask them to send me a proof the driver try to contact me and they couldn‚Äôt and i never received a refund or something.So avoid if you want to keep your money or they can steal your money and your food.very dissapointed",0
"After signing up to talk/talk as a New customer in 2019-2022, Everything that I was offered sounded like a really good deal, unlimited booster call, wifi, High speed internet, as I later found out, this is just to draw you in, making them sound so good! It‚Äôs when your contract comes to an end! Is when they truthful act comes, Asking you to pay more for the same service just laughable, so I told them I was struggling to pay, an through it would be best that I would leave, and find a deal with another company, I was told THREE TIMES that they could offer me the same deal as before but at a lower rate, what a lie!! And I only found out when I received second bill, I was not given the full facts on a new contract, Now it‚Äôs deadlocked..!!!",0
"Ordered some sheets for my sons new bed and arranged for them to be delivered to my local Sainsbury's.
Went in to collect at the weekend using the automated machine in the store. It said someone would be along to help. They didn't and i had stuff to do so i went back today. The young man told me, after putting the order number and bar code into his hand held device, that they did not have my order and i should speak to Argos.
I went online to try to sort this out and was told by the 'person' at the other end that there was nothing they could do as the order had been collected. Also advised me they will have cctv to prove its been collected.
I asked if the 'person' thought i was lying. They said its our process. Nothing they can do.
Amazing.
An order goes missing so either Sainsbury's staff are lying or the customer is.
Complaint made by calling customer services.
I want a refund and I'll buy off Amazon like everyone else.",0
Fast response from companies interested in doing the work.,1
"I've booked my broadband on 2nd of Feb for installation today, the engineer due to attend on an Am slot has had some apparent personal issue and has decided to not show up. Bt nor the engineer had notified me of this. Its only because I rang the engineer to no answer then had to ring bt customer service to be told this. Had I of known customer and engineer service would be so abysmal I would've not used bt as my provider",0
"I soooo regret ever going with Now broadband. Constant issues of router restarting and slow speeds. Took 2 weeks to fix once ringing everyday over a period of a week. To do exactly same thing a couple months later.

Funny thing is before Now I was on talktalk and never had one single issue and their router is so much better.

I will never be a customer of now or sky again. I will actually pay more to stay away from them.",0
"Just had a pizza delivered by one of their cyclists, all the topping was lying at one side of the box ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨absolute shambles of a company and my pizza was ruined.and yet another foreigner who can‚Äôt read a map properly, why employ such thick c**** ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨",0
Easy to use service and they look just as they did on the screen. Also arrived two days earlier than expected.,1
"Not really GHDs fault but due to delivery company leaving it outside ( I live in a block of flats), it‚Äôs been taken so I haven‚Äôt received my product yet. Have informed GHD and waiting for a response as to what can be done.",0
The order came when you said it would.,1
I ordered a refurbished phone in March 2021 and didn‚Äôt receive it. They promised a refund and in January 2022 still haven‚Äôt received it and they ignore my emails. Couldn‚Äôt get a charge back on my card either to the lapse time scale. Utterly disgusted by hey have gone from a great company to being fraudulent company.,0
"Do not use this company.. they are a complete bunch of charlatans. I have been lied to as I suspected, shortly after speaking to Huma in customer services a driver Ed Majeska rang to rudely say I'm not getting my tumble dryer today. I have just spent half an hour on the phone being passed around. Absolutely no one will help. I was accidentally passed to Leah Willows who organises the drivers. Her drivers hadn't kept her informed and have turned their phones off. Been told to ring them back again for the third time. Why didn't someone just call this morning to rearrange? Rang and spoke to Ben Rhodes and requested my call be escalated straight away but Managers do not take calls?! Left my number for a Manager to call. I had a call got an apology but that doesn't cut it. I've cancelled the order and will not be making any further purchases from Curry's. Please do not reply to this review I don't want anything whatsoever from you, you had your chance to provide a product and service and failed spectacularly.",0
"Absolutely useless company. Tried to install a washing machine with no basic plumbing equipment, flooded my kitchen and then basically ran away without telling me there was an almighty leak from one of the pipes in the kitchen cupboard! Remedial plumbing works were incredibly basic (capping off a pipe - absolutely out of the sphere of ability of the operatives) but cost me ¬£80 which I am now trying to recoup and being fobbed off by telephone operatives at every occasion. Utterly disgraceful, useless and inept at every turn. DO NOT BOTHER.",0
"I ordered a Simba Duvet and joined Very for this reason in the title description it said single white duvet yet you choose a size so I ticked King size.
Yet adding it to checkout it still stated Single I phoned Very to confirm why it would say this yet after a 16 minute wait to get through I was told as long as I have ticked King that will be what I receive. As I still didn‚Äôt trust what I was being told I also contacted Very via their Facebook messenger and explained the situation again I was told the same information.
So I went ahead and ordered and guess what an arrived a sing Duvet instead or the King size I needed and I still am non the wiser how they still have not changed this on their site.
I then had to ring Very again to arrange a pick up the next day for a return and refund so I had to stay home all day with no time slot or clue when the item would be picked up and I was also told I had to wait 7 working days for a refund which meant I couldn‚Äôt order the right size if I wanted to because I had to wait for a refund to re order all over again and the same situation could happen it‚Äôs like no one who works for very have any way to make sure a customer gets what they order and still no refund and the king size duvet is now out of stock so my first experience with VERY has not been very good at all.
I won‚Äôt be ordering from them in future.",0
Ordering process was simple. part arrived and was of good quality. Very Competitive pricing and appears to be good value for money spent.,1
Very good easy to order good d delivery,1
"I had been using NowTV for a few years, back when the entertainment pass was ¬£7.99 a month and had no ads!
Now its just shocking to see that in order to get the most out of it you pay a tenner for the movie pass, a tenner for the TV show pass, and now due to the fact they've added ridiculous adverts despite already paying a subscription they now have the cheek to offer the ""boost"" option for an extra fiver to get rid of the adverts? Ridiculous!
I don't want to have to sit through 2 minute long adverts during a movie or numerous 30 second adverts during a 25 minute TV show... It's an absolute con to be paying that sort of money when competitors such as Netflix and disney+ charge less than a tenner for far better content! (No ads, better quality, TV and movies on the same pass, and SUBTITLES).
Most things on nowtv don't have subtitles and the ones that do have subtitles stop working properly once an advert is finished which is simply just infuriating. It's not very accessible to not have working subtitles.
All of the above are just a few of the major flaws NowTV has. Until they are fixed I don't plan on subscribing to them again!",0
Waiting in all evening for payed delivery promised No contact phone lines busy and now found out online returned to depot. Poor poor poor,0
"Excellent service, very prompt replacement of faulty parts.",1

"Easy to locate what I needed on the website, it was exactly what I needed (a spout filter for a Russell Hobbes kettle) and arrived promptly. Thanks!",1
"I'm actually speechless, that such a well known brand can deliver such an incredibly poor service. I ordered an upgrade on April 28th which I chose to return as I decided I wanted to change network. I received the phone on April 29th. The phone was returned in its original packaging unopened on April 30th via Royal mail special delivery and delivered on May 1st. I spoke to one of their representatives online informing them that I would like to cancel my upgrade. Instead of cancelling the upgrade, someone has taken it upon themselves to issue me with another contract minus a mobile phone and minus 12gb of data, for the exactly the same amount of money. Why on earth would any want to have a new two-year contract without a new phone and 12gb less data. This was done the following day after the phone had been returned. TEN EMAILS and another letter sent via Royal mail special delivery, asking for the upgrade to be cancelled. 22 days later and I'm still waiting. I can't switch networks with the same mobile number as Vodaphone won't terminate the contract without The Carphone Warehouse informing them that the phone has been returned. I wasted hours on webchats with their customer service reps only to realise that I was wasting my time. On two occasions members of their team refused to discuss the problem as they claimed that the details I gave them did not match with their records. After careful scrutiny I realised that the only detail that was different was that I typed Flat 364, instead of appartment 364. I asked the representative if this was issue, but she refused to discuss it any further and cut me off. Finally, I will conclude buy saying, if CPW don't have means to function at an acceptable standard, then they should be closed for business, during this period.",0
"Chose Three specifically as I could put a zero price cap to prevent my disabled daughter from being tempted to click ""accept"" on every shiny advert and the subsequent bill... turns out Threes own ""Three Pay"" system can circumvent the cap, and guess what, this is the direct quote from the 'chat' with their operator ""... if we had any option to block this Three Pay services i would have got that activated for you""

A month later I see money leaving my account and it had been for 3 months,I contacted customer help (that's a joke in itself) ,they did they'd refund me for 2 months,they could clearly see it had never been used but for whatever reason the subscription kept running, a month of emailing they kept saying they would refund and asking me to confirm,this went on and on and on,to cut a long and very boring waste of life story now tv customer service are dirt, dont use this company you'll regret it and the programs are rubbish. Dont sign up for a trail either because they keep charging after you cancel then blame you.

Do not use now tv you've been warned.",0

But when I tried the online chat to sort out what had happened, they kept saying I'd been called and the doorbell rung. The driver apparently waited 11 minutes. I was literally sitting in the house right there and I know this was not true. But OK - supposing their records say otherwise, I get there's a conflict, but they refused to do anything to sort out the problem. I was charged a lot of money for food that never came. This is theft. Don't use this service in Chester.",0

SHELL owe me ¬£89:31 from my old gas account and said that I would receive a cheque for the amount they owe me for over charging me for gas. I am still waiting for the cheque to arrive and so far it's been 3 weeks since I was told that I would be refunded.
For anyone who is going to get SHELL energy I would think twice about it as they are one of the worst companies for not getting things done, you pay your bills and then for the next few months they send you demanding payment letters.
I will not even give them 1 star ,I'm a 70 year old pensioner and it's not nice getting threatening letters for money I've already paid.
Thank you",0
As always a very positive ordering experience.,1
Excellent service from MPD. New phone arrived next day! Thanks to all at MPD. Will use them in future and I'll spread the word. 10/10 service.,1
Excellent service from start to finish. Next day delivery without charge and great price. The two men who delivered our American Fridge/Freezer Jordan and Danveer were so polite and respectful of both the new appliance and our property when manoeuvring the large appliance around. Really couldn't have asked for more. Will definitely use Marks Electricals if I ever need another appliance and will recommend them to anyone.,1
An absolute joke! Manager Hannah at the Blackburn office is a disgrace to the company.,0
Do not buy the white wifi dongle (2021 model) from this company. It has appalling battery life and the signal keeps dropping off. It is poorly designed and NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE. All my other equipment from Vodafone are excellent. I have been a customer for 15 years with a corporate account. They retailer would not replace with the new model until my contract ends in July 2023. Shabby,0
"Tried reporting fault for elderly neighbour after 2 new replacement poles put up. Tried to make appointment for engineer to call but couldn't.

"Great service, when I ordered the wrong size filter, after a helpful phone call I received the correct filter the next day!",1
I ordered these as a Christmas present for my loved one. Ghd offered a garrenteed delivery before Christmas at an additional cost which was paid. Yet I still haven't received my item! To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. I thought going direct to the provider although not being as cheap as other places would assure that I would receive them without issue! No contact to sort this has been made even after emailing! Going to Dyson wouldn't have caused me this issue!,0
"I ordered the item on-line and was invited to pick a delivery date (Monday). I was very pleased to receive this item on Saturday.

Unfortunately, I was unable to set up the item due to damage, presumably during transit. I contacted Hughes on Monday morning and spoke to Laura, who was extremely pleasant and very helpful. She arranged for the item to be delivered by your couriers and set up. This was arranged for Wednesday. Due to my unforeseen circumstances, it was finally delivered and set up by Kevin on Friday. He was also very pleasant and very helpful. Overall a ver good experience. Keep it up!!",1

I ordered and it was offering a free gift.
My order turned up without the free gift.

Not great & i have been completely ripped off.",0

Sent my iPhone 11 to Mazuma in perfect condition. Kept in a case from the very beginning and well looked after. Not a scratch on it yet they have reduced my offer by ¬£55 due to apparently multiple scratches on the casing! I do not agree and won‚Äôt be using them again. I just knew that would happen before even reading the reviews. Very unhappy!,0
"Your salesman, Joe, in your Leeds shop, was very knowledgable and helpful when I came into store looking for a Turntable, Amp and Speakers. Although you didn't have the Amp and Speakers in stock, Joe arranged free delivery if the items. The items arrived on the date he said. The only issue was that Joe had arranged for the Speaker Leads to be delivered as well but DPD somehow managed to put the Lead on a different van, meaning I didn't receive it until the following day (not your fault). I've set up the system and it plays really well. Thanks yo all uour staff in Leeds their product knowledge and Customer Service Skills are a credit to your Company. Thanks again.",1

"They made a big mistake with me and THEY profited !!!
I posted my PS5 with 2 controllers and some games to them as there was not a local CEX i could get to. They lied and sent me false pics of a scratched up PS5 saying it was mine (mine was mint condition) i sent them dated timestamped pics of my actual console and games with no marks or scratches but they wouldn't believe me and offered me a low price to sell to them. I panicked thinking if i don't accept..... whatever they send back to me would NOT be my console but someone elses beaten up / scratched console! so i felt i was stuffed and accepted the lower offer. Heartbroken how i was scammed by them even after the pics and careful packaging etc it still didn't protect me",0

"I sent in an Iphone 11 Pro (bought in early 2020 as a present for a Covid victim) that has never been used or even taken out of the box other than to find the IMEI number and to remove the plug, lightening cable and ear phones as requested bt Mazuma. The offered ¬£340 was reduced to ¬£280 because apparently ""the mobile had multiple scratches on the casing and we only allow up to 5"". Despite my ringing and asking for clarity I was quite frankly stonewalled. I know that the phone was perfect when I posted it securely fastened in its original box. Stupidly in hindsight I should have taken photos as we all know these days photograph dates can be proven as they all exist on jpeg files. Warning to all, take photos and send copies with your phones, when you find yourself in dispute then and they offer ""to send you photos"" of your device, you have your originals. Disgusted with their service and their attitiude.",0

The engineer was very polite and friendly and professional. He insisted on removing his shoes and explained the problem to me.,1

The Broadband speed is fantastic with the added bonus of no landline so no more dodgy, scam or sales phone calls. Very happy all round.",1

My last request was for a member of management to get in touch with me, I received a text 15 minutes later saying my complaint had been closed. What's the point!? Don't sign up with BT, they will just do what they want with your bills and never solve real issues.",0
"Made an order with a total value of 29.78. The driver did not put the items in a heat bag and as a result my food was stone cold and inedible upon arrival. I contacted customer services and was told I would be given a refund.
Finally get around to checking my online banking for refund to find a refund of 5.15. Contacted customer services again and was told they give you a percentage of the affected items. So in their eyes a 17% refund on a meal you cannot eat is appropriate. When asking to take this higher the customer service representative disconnected.
Further communication with a different agent has secured me my full refund and a complaint has been raised.
If you have any issues please make sure that you ask for a full refund or they will give you as little as they think they can get away with.",0

"Ask when my contract expired. Had only begun in May and I asked if it was a good contact to which he replied yes. However, he then went into the details of how good my contract was and when I should look at renewing it again in Nov or Dec of 2023. He was specific and knowledgeable and this he shared with me and I'm hoping for another ""good"" contract in the year to come. Thank you",1
I have reviewed once already when these clowns left my business with no phoneline. Now I find that they have defaulted to not accepting any withheld numbers - why would any business not want calls from potential customers irrespective of whether they choose to withhold their number? I did not want or request this and it has potentially cost me - again. Avoid vodafone.,0

"Placed an order. Received confirmation.
Shortly after, received an email saying it had been cancelled, with no information about why. Tried to contact customer service. After about 6 attempts on the website and 8 phone calls where the automated messages kept hanging up on me with some prerecorded message saying an order could be cancelled because the collection time had expired (not the case) or there was a payment problem (not the case) I finally got through to someone who told me yes, it had been cancelled but that they did not know why and could not find out. Now I just have to hope the money comes back to my account.",0

"I was overcharged by over ¬£1,100 by Three for a contract I ended with them. They never even cancelled it, admitted the error (first of several), and promised me a refund. This was months ago.

They acknowledged that they owed me a large refund, but consistently delayed in paying me. The first excuse they had for the delay was that I needed to cancel the contract again, officially, and wait for my next billing date. Fine. I waited, and after the date, heard nothing from Three.

So I called again, was initially told by them that they didn't owe me anything, before they eventually admitted that they still owed me over ¬£1,100, and to wait 3-5 working days for it. Okay.

3-5 days later, nothing. So I call again - please wait 3-5 more working days. 3-5 more days, and again, nothing.

After calling them yet again and practically begging for the money they owed me, they told me there was a human error with processing the refund, and they will need to retry it. They hadn't told me this, and apparently were just waiting for me to call after not getting the money. Told to wait yet again for the money, which didn't arrive in the time they said it would.

Months later, I finally have my refund. I have received less than nothing from Three in terms of service. I was calling them twice a week, and basically begging for my money back, just to hear the same scripted answer that always turned out to be untrue. This went on for months. Zero communication from them, nothing they promised happened.

I won't even mention the absolutely terrible signal because other reviews seem to have that covered. If you're ever in a major city - just don't expect any coverage at all. My phone often tells me I have 5G, but isn't able to even load an email. This is always the case for my Three mobile whenever I am in London. I have to use my work phone, which has BT Mobile, whenever I'm travelling, which has zero problems. Paying a couple of pounds more per month to another provider is not just worth it - it's basically essential if you ever actually want to use your phone.

From now on, if I dislike someone, I will simply avoid them. But if I hate someone, I will recommend Three to them. Avoid this company at all costs, and if your contract ends with them, IT IS ESSENTIAL that you contact your bank and make sure they are blocked from taking any more money on the DD. Otherwise, like me, they will just keep charging you. And it will take you months of stress to get it back.

I am sure I will receive an automated copy+paste response telling me to get in touch with somebody, etc. I don't care. I have included my Three account details with this review. They can contact me directly if they want to make amends. Their way of saying sorry to me, after all this, and after I insisted they compensate me, was to give me 50% off my standard bill rate, for one month.",0
Terrible Service & constant lies. This has been on going from the 16th Dec. All I wanted was Broadband after moving into my new home! The previous occupier had broadband so you would think this would be straight forward? They came out so I took the day off work and guess what he said there was a problem and off he went to the box miles away. when he came back and said it would be on in a couple of hours! Nope no broadband. Came back again on the 7th Jan said it was fixed and nope not on. This is getting ridiculous now. Lots of phone calls in between and lots of empty promises and plenty of lies. Beware!! I'm trapped as nobody else can provide so I'm stuck with them.,0

My contract expired with this shower but they never bother to inform me either before the contract was about to expire nor after it had expired. It wasn't until I looked at my bank statement that I realised they had double my bill by removing discounts.
3 months of being ripped off by this go-awful company.
On speaking to customer services(that's a laugh) customer service!!!!!!!! they couldn't understand why they didn't contact, but they found it easy finding me to tell I owed them money, strange that!!!!!!
I cancelled my line and ceased doing business with them and will never do business again.

Warranty is warranty. If vodaphone fix for free. Then customers would stay",0
Been with Vodafone for many many years 2 years ago took new 2 year contract out and phone out within a week started having phone problems called them and they rebooted phone ect and informed me that my phone was meant to be a pay as you go phone but now will be OK üëå a week later same problems but went down with serious illness and was bed bound for 8 months. My phone was still playing up so called them again from my bed and explained my problem and my situation about my illness and informed them i needed my phone to see whos at the door and to release my door lock.they said I'll need to take my phone into a shop ?? but I cannot leave the bed due to my illness they then said ask a neighbour or friend ok but I need a phone while you sort mine out they offered me a new temp phone for ¬£40 but hold on if my phone is a couple of monhs old it's still under guarantee. I asked them when my contract ended and was informed it will end oct 2022.ok I sent it back. there come back to me with the answer was it has internal faults NO water damage but bad internal faults but could not tell me what faults because they dont give out that information hold on the phones in mint condition no damage at all how can it have internal damage if it got dropped ect the case would have a scratch scuff marks NOTHING because I've been layed up in bed how can it have internal faults mmm. They offered me ¬£100 which I refused all I wanted was my phone fixed they basically said no so I purchased a new phone and waited till my contract term ended this month as I was informed. low and behold I just called them and there now saying ive got another year left on my contract and cannot see ANY of my previous telephone conversations with them on there screen. Before i called them i done a online chat with them 52 texts later YES 52 all I was at was you owe ¬£54 on your phone contract and your have 1 year left on your air time but my phone ends now thats not right I was told my whole contract ended in Oct 2022 but I've got another year air time ??. That's when I called them and low a behold the lady on the phone said all of a sudden the ¬£54 has gone .. it's a joke somebody has to look into this company they keeping customers on yhe phone for hours passing you to different departments each time your having to confirm your personal details every time trying to wear you down so you hang up.this is a big company tactic please someone do some thing imagine if this was an old person trying to end there contract they just were you down it's wrong,0
"Unfortunately leaving bad reviews is futile as there is no regulation of the standard of service to customers from vodafone, but for what it's worth I signed up for Vodafone broadband in September 2022, given a guarantee activation date about a month later. After three months and countless calls later I still didn't have any internet at home so I cancelled the service as it was affecting my quality of life. I was told I would be compensated a small fee for the inconvenience onto my mobile phone account. This never happened. Months later and countless phonecalls and time spent trying to resolve this issue, I have been informed that there is no record from my notes of this issue or that a refund would ever be issued.
The money is entirely unimportant; I am astounded that I have been lied to by at least 10 employees consistently over the space over several months, that records have either been falsified or never actually documented accurately and that so much of my time has been wasted.
I have been severely mistreated and repeated lied to to an extent that makes my blood boil. This is without a doubt the worst company I have ever dealt with.",0

All along the process I have been given advice and help in choosing my new TV.,1
Delivery cancelled at the last minute when courier realised that delivery address is in red route and the item is on an HGV.

"We wanted a WiFi compatible washing machine, so we could remotely start the washing. We picked a WiFi compatible machine, paid and arranged delivery and paid for fitting and removal of the old machine.

The machine came and was delivered and installed. They said they had no record of us paying for removal of old machine. I showed them the email confirmation, and tols them to remove it, they did. We did not get a demonstration as stated.

Anyway, I played around with it and realised it wasn't WiFi compatible only NFC compatible. I rang Team Knowhow who said it definitely was WiFi compatible, so the sent a replacement guaranteed is that this one would have WiFi.

Again replacement came and again it was only NFC compatible. Rang team knowhow and they said the spec of the product was wrong on the website and blamed the manufacturer. We explained this is actually miss selling and after waiting for a manager to call us back we received a discount. After this point we had spoken to various team knowhow advisors over 2.5 hours over 2 weeks and every advisor we spoke to either contradicted the last or had no product knowledge at all. We accepted the discount as we had really lost faith.

3 days later the machine encountered a fault. I decided after dealing with incompetent kids on keyboards to email the CEO directly. We explained the complete shambles that was and we received a huge discount and a higher spec replacement.

I'd advise anyone having an issue with a product from curry's pcWorld to contact the ceo team directly as it cuts out the incompetent customer services who frankly have not even basic technical knowledge to help you.",0

I called 5 times and got no where via 191 and numbers they provide to make contact with the automated service that cuts off!! 3 times out 5!!! I then turned to chatbot which is disturbingly bad! chatted to 7 agents still no joy!! wasted 30 mins before asking if i want to be transfered to the correct team, why did it take 30 mins when the agent knows thats what i wanted from the start of the chat?!!! I would not recommend using Vodafone if you want to keep your sanity!!! Caused unnecessary stress and anxiety. So 4 hours 30 and still got no where!!! Please do not use Vodafone! Customer services and care do not exsist with Vodafone. You cant speak with any agents, So I have a brand new contract but will be ending this and going elsewhere, happy to still be in the cooling off period! Very very poor service, the signal is even rubbish! And Voda dont bother replying or trying to make contact. I triedf for 4 hours 30 and got no where.

This customer service is a joke. I had no issues ordering and paying for the item though. Now there's a shock !! I am in the process of ordering a new fridge/freezer but because of the lack of any responsibility from this company it won't be from this lot in case there's a fault. I'm sure Robot Ryan will be sorry and get to me ASAP though.
And there we have it !!!!

"I am out of pocket over 200 euro due to incompetent staff working in parkway shopping centre store in Ireland. I was advised to change contract from one provider to another to cut bill cost. They never checked my contract status, I could not as my phone was smashed, the reason for being at the store.
I subsequently had one provider taking 125 euro termination fee as still in contract and continuing to take the direct debit as if still a customer.
The direct debit for the new provider was never set up correctly and I got hit with late payment and extra charges.
The store will take no responsibility as staff member not working there anymore.
What should have cost 15 euro per month has cost 220 euro.
I rang the store 22 times to sort the issue left voice messages, went into the store and was advised the manager would ring. Eventually I had to ask the sister store to contact them. An assistant managed called and said they basically were taking no responsibility. No good enough it was misinformation from them that encurred all these costs.",0
"NO COMMUNICATION/CANCELLED A REPAIR.

Booked a repair which was cancelled during the window of expecting my engineer by text message. They then proceeded to rearrange another visit WITHOUT speaking to me for over a weeks time. An all day window on New Year‚Äôs Eve which has now meant I‚Äôve had to cancel plans.

Originally I‚Äôd,
Booked the day off of work

I will be cancelling my plan once I‚Äôve found a resolve as I financially can not do anything else such as buy a new washing machine which if I could I would, This has been nothing but stress to deal with & I have had to chase the matter completely.

"Had two phones previously from QMF that we‚Äôre superb. Ordered a third refurbished iPhone but after a week told it was not available to be shipped. Was offered ¬£40 off for a lower grade. I accepted the offer. The phone is faulty and keeps restarting. The refund still not arrived after nearly 3 weeks. No replies from their customer services (only available by e-mail). Not confident of getting money back if I send the phone back - I want a replacement, not a refund. Very disappointed.",0

It was despatched the next morning with full tracking details and it arrived the following day. Very well packed and exactly as described. Faultless transaction from start to finish!",1

"Do not order from Quickmobilefix under any circumstances ‚Äì they reel you in with a professional looking website, good prices and a brand which implies prompt service.

I have just received my refund today for a phone which I ordered on 21 September 2020 and cancelled exactly one month later on 21 October.

As numerous others have said avoid this company at all costs. I was looking to get a refurbished phone to last me a few months before I set up a new contract. Stupidly, without looking at reviews, I placed an order on 21 September. I had pretty much the same experience as the rest of the negative reviews here ‚Äì phone didn‚Äôt arrive in the stipulated time-frame followed by excuses and false promises - covid/short-staffed/with tech team/being tested/on the priority delivery list etc etc. After over four weeks of this, I decided to cancel my order. I subsequently bought a phone online from elsewhere (after checking reviews) and the experience could not have been different ‚Äì phone arrived two days after I placed my order, I had a minor issue which they resolved very quickly and with no quibble.

To say Quickmobilefix's business practices are a disgrace is putting it mildly ‚Äì avoid.",0

The I got the package details I signed up, but by that time I was so tired as I was sick with COVID however I checked it to see he has omitted 2nd box, Netflix, Now tv and waving off one off charge.
When called BT they said they will simply cancel the order. They are unable to honour what there staff offered? They wanted to go through my requirement again.I am not going to spend another hour with it! Obviously the agent thought people will not check their e mails and I would have know about it only on installation which would have been horrible!",0
"What a disgrace this company is

2 door to door salesman convinced us to move from BT to talk talk and told us as we were staying within open reach we would be charged ¬£10 for every month our BT contract had to run . This was 10 months

We received a bill for ¬£235 from BT and when we rang to query they advised they know nothing about the ¬£10 per month agreement? We have to pay ¬£235

Talk talk said they would ‚Äú have to investigate ‚Äú and when I asked to speak to a manager I was told that was not possible and a manager would also not be able to call me back

We were also charged ¬£9.95 delivery ( not informed about ) . Paying delivery for a service charged at ¬£49 per month ! Really !!

Customer service shocking .on phone for an hour with no resolution

This company is a disgrace . Unfortunately for Talk Talk I have the whole thing on camera ( including audio )

This company needs to be stopped from having a door to door sales team that tell blatant lies",0

Delay in receiving my item Hermes courier attempted to deliver never reattempted .Contacted Ghd eventually had an email reply after several email enquiries they redelivered a replacement a week and a half after I should have received.I do hope that ghd investigate what happened to the original parcel as appeared to have disappeared without no option to track via text tracking and no card left just an attempt to leave via ring doorbell !!,0
"Ordered contract upgrade on the Monday, email comes over delivery for next day (standard), text massage then received we will text you on the morning of your delivery with a time slot bla bla, fine.

On day 2 still no message so i go on the online chat, the phone is my daughters upgrade for her birthday following week so it's fairly urgent. In the chat they say it will definitely arrive to you in the next day or so we are just waiting for DPD to send us a tracking number...fine

5 days later still no message, i call this time and get told my delivery will be on 26th October!!!!!! one month after i ordered! And far to late for my daughters birthday, how is that acceptable????

Suffice to say i cancelled the order and will be leaving three completely, I will be going with sky mobile where i can get her the iphone14 for cheaper than i was going to pay for the iphone11 with three anyway.

P.S call base was in India!!

i suggest everyone steer clear of three worst phone company i have ever had the pleasure of dealing with.",0

"Do not buy a phone from Carphone Warehouse.
CW lost my phone after I took it in for a warranty repair on 9 September (yes, 7 weeks ago and the issue is still not resolved). Numerous visits, unanswered phone calls and emails later they have not said sorry and tell me they ""don't compensate for life"" (ie the stress, inconvenience and time that they have caused me for something that was in no way my fault). Apart from the ladies in the shop in Gravesend (who were understanding and helped as much as they could) the customer service has been awful.",0

I ordered an iPhone 11 at the start of December 2020 & then had to cancel the order, which I did within 24 hours. I was told my refund would be processed within 14 working days.
I contacted them in early January 2021 & was told due to Covid-19 they would not be able to provide my refund until 3rd February. It never happened, so I contacted them again & was told it would be by 3rd March...it never happened. I'm now awaiting a date of 30th April, but I know it won't be processed.

"I was originally told my tv would be returned to me within a week as it was a very simple repair job, ended up taking two months and every time I asked for an update someone told me they would look into it and never came back to me. Worst overall customer service experience I've ever had. There is even a guarantee of a replacement if the repair takes more than two weeks on your website which you refused to honour due to covid. If you're not going to honour it you've had months to remove it from your website. Absolute joke from start to finish would not recommend to anyone and would avoid using again at all costs.",0

"Always had my bill date as 23rd of every month since the start of my contract, I then received texts from them 2 month ago saying I would be charged late payment if I didnt pay by the 20th, I contacted them and they'd changed payment date without even asking or letting me know, I asked them to change it back and they said they had. Then last month I had the same thing saying I'd be charged late payment fee if it wasn't paid by the 5th so they had changed it again without my permission, I had to contact them again and they finally changed it back to 23rd like it had been for the last yeah and half but I have still been charged late payment fees. Had loads of problems from the start of this contract. As soon as my contracts up I will be changing networks, also the upgrade deals for existing customers are terrible much cheaper elsewhere",0

Bought a fridge freezer online from Hughes to be delivered on a specific day. Was given a time slot of 1730 to 1930. At 1731 on day of delivery the tracking updated to say ‚Äúdelivery unsuccessful‚Äù. Contacted delivery company to ask why and apparently route was cancelled as driver had reached maximum legal driving time. Why was my delivery scheduled for after this time?! Earliest date to rebook was 5 days later! Contacted Hughes as well and they gave excuses of ‚Äúdelivery date is an estimate‚Äù and ‚Äúdaylight hours are short‚Äù?!? Why schedule deliveries when they know they won‚Äôt meet them?! And also schedule them for when it‚Äôs too dark for them to work?! Also in the winter they must only be delivering between 10am and 3pm while it‚Äôs light enough if that is the case?! Won‚Äôt be ordering again.,0
"WOW! How friendly and helpful was Ravi and his assistant. Not only did they arrive on time, but they carried the freezer round to the back door ( as the front was blocked). They brought it inside and positioned it exactly where we wanted it. We wish all our delivery guys were as helpful as this. Thank you.",1

"I bought a Samsung phone on their website, when the phone was still under warranty it started to freeze a lot - so I took it to their shop to repair and after 2 long weeks the phone came back worse! After changing the motherboard on the handset they did something wrong and the device is not longer consider a safe device by google or samsung. So I am not allowed to do any payments on my phone or install any apps that demand a security process - even Netflix doesn't allow me to use it without the certification. Their only solution is to send it again to the same repair centre that did the wrong before. Even Samsung doesn't know how to fix their doing - and they told me how Carphone Warehouse is known for doing really bad repairs. I use my phone to work on daily basis and I have already lost almost a month of pay because of this mess and they refuse to replace the phone - only offer taking my phone for more two weeks of repair. How to trust them again?",0

Easy!",1

Absolutely disgusting company!!! Sold me an iPhone 7 last October after 1 month I had to send it back in as the signal kept going. Sent it got it back after 4 weeks. Again 3 weeks later I had to send it back to be repaired again! They told me they was substantial water damage to it and wanted me to pay ¬£70!! Clearly this phone was damaged before we recieved it as my daughter only used it to walk to and from school!‚Ä¶ I reluctantly paid the ¬£70‚Ä¶ 6 weeks later still no phone returned‚Ä¶ they sent me an email stating the exact same thing and that I need to pay yet another ¬£70!!‚Ä¶ I refused and asked them to send my handset back as it was‚Ä¶ this was the end of February 2021‚Ä¶.. email after email of asking where my device was‚Ä¶ the last bit of communication I had from them was July!!‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs now December 2021 so 12 months after having my phone and they still have not returned it!!! Never ever will I buy from this site and I‚Äôll make sure anyone I know doesn‚Äôt either!,0
"Ordered food at 7 pm and waited for an hour then a message popped up that food was delivered on time without delivery.

The customer service assistant and the manager repeated the same excuse 100 times but had no desired to sort out the issue. Do not waste your time and use other options for delivery.

"Wish I could give a sub-zero rating. The service was not only bad but straight up outrageous. BT advertised their Fibre 1 to be available in my flat and made me transfer my landline to them in order to place an order for the broadband service. Just for me to find out after the line had been transferred that I can only get the very basic package, on which the speed was 90% slower than the fibre connection? Called then three times inbetween but it seems like nobody knows there what they‚Äôre talking about.

So I contact the web chat person, webchat person (Yashika) lies to me, tells me it's in stock collect today. Ask her why does my email then say Wednesday 25? She says my payment has to be verified and cleared. I'm using a currys voucher for the entire amount.

Absolute kafkaesque shop that I will not go back to ever again now. Nothing ever in stock, webchat people lie to you. Website says in store and available, but for some reason my order will be delivered to the store 2 days from now? Absolute disgrace.",0

"If I could give this company a zero out of 5 I would. Terrible service. Ordered a meal. Driver claims he called me, I called his number back that was listed on the site. He could not speak English. Sent message he left on my doorstep but never did. The driver lied, their customer chat line did not help. Kisha Mae disconnected me, so did Stacey Ann. Asked for a refund and they said it was a false delivery that I was not there when I was. Instructions of how to find us was listed in the special instructions section with my mobile number, but as the driver could not speak English he did not follow these. He claims he delivered and they are charging me. But I never got the meal. Terrible after care from there customer service team. They are charging me for a non delivered meal, no customer service. And a driver who does not read instruction and call the mobile number provided. I called the driver on his mobile he hung up on me and then removed his mobile so I could not see it. I will logging an official complaint tomorrow with their quality assurance team. But my advise to all those out there is never use deliveroo.",0
"I am as of right now, extremely frustrated and disappointment with the customer service from PC Specialist. Like many of the other bad 1-star reviews here, my problems seem to be eerily similar in substance.

I ordered a custom laptop on which it's first day of use had a technical problem with the RAM cards causing the screen to completely break. This is a 'known fault' I am told, and an easy fix to carry out myself which I was not prepared to do as it wouldn't be covered by warranty if something did go wrong.

I had to create an RMA and send it off which was a joke in itself as when the delivery driver pulled up on my drive I physically watched him lean across his van and took a picture of the house and then upload it saying there was no one in. The irony being that you could see me in the picture standing in the window and by the time I had got downstairs, the driver had gone. When I rang DPD they cited 'he's running late so cant come back to you and that's the reason you were missed out.' Obviously this was completely obscene.

This was meant to be my new work laptop so it was extremely annoying having to wait 2 weeks (when it eventually did get collected properly) for it to be returned to me, all the while using some old piece of tech that was absolutely awful (but at least it actually worked...) When it did return I used it for maybe 4 days and then the exact same problem happened again. The screen glitch.

Upon ringing the customer service number I get told 'The RAM must have been knocked in transit' Again, it's an easy fix to do it yourself BUT no we wont cover the warranty if you break it. I don't want to send it off again because as I mentioned previously, this is my work laptop and I have transferred all my work across to it and sending it off again would annoy not only me but also my company. I asked if they could send a technician out to do it, no, they don't do that. They said if I wasn't prepared to do the repair myself I would have to send it back in but I asked what would stop the exact same situation arising again when I got it back the next time? The answer is nothing, so I ask what is the point then?

I then decide I need to return this because there's obviously a problem with the build quality from this place even after having spent ¬£1,800 on this laptop. Apparently I cant return it because it was ordered with a business card as it says in the T's and C's. Why? Why can't I return the faulty piece of equipment that you have supplied? Which I then gave you the chance to fix and it still haven't?

This all put's me in an extremely frustrating position and a completely horrible experience from when I first turned it on, right the way through to where I find myself now. Absolute shambles",0
Prompt delivery and parts were as hoped for,1
"Allegations
Told VM to end the contract for Feb 7th- They cut me off January 9th- since then no connection, Call center in Inda, got a formal complaint from the family- VM did the investigation and merely offered feedback to the agent. Also closed my account.
So we have a breach of contract and consequential losses. Also, the Subject Acess request was not Acknowledged so a complaint to the Information Commissioner's office. SO IT'S THE SMALL CLAIMS COURT. Beth and co your sound bites are laughable and meaningless, and so transparent. So my guidance to you bunch look at the Truspoilet site have a group think what is the common denominator??. A big hint it's not the customers",0
"I've been going to Richer Sounds for all my AV & home cinema needs for 20 years.

Partner's mum needed to upgrade her old LG TV so I suggested Richer Sounds instead of her usual big electrical retailer.

Excellent service as always, free sound bar included and we were even given a discount/refund as the TV price had dropped between the day we paid and the day we collected.

A very nice surprise and another reason why I'll always choose them first and recommend them to others. Cheers!",1
"Febuary 2021 I paid this company nearly‚Ä¶
Febuary 2021 I paid this company nearly ¬£200 to repair my phone, was a simple screen repair, or so i thought. week later i receive an email saying phone cannot be repaired due to them not being able to source the parts ( its a 1 year old phone)!. the phone was returned to me.

2 weeks went by i heard nothing else, so I emailed them to ask where was my refund!. I heard nothing for over a week, they said that due too covid they were short on staff and that they would look into it!. Guess what..... yes you guessed it, I heard now't!!!

my last email was sent in march requesting an up date as to my refund they said i would be paid on or before May 13th 2021.........today is the 16th of May 2021 and still no refund.

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY

I WOULD RATHER BANG ME WEDDING TACKLE REPEATEDLY IN THE POST OFFICE DOOR THAN USE THIS SHOWER AGAIN",0

"If I could rate 0 I would! Please save yourself time and don‚Äôt bother with talk talk. We went with them only to immediately have a fault. It took a month to resolve. Then 10 days later we had another fault and it is over a month later and this is not resolved. We have spent HOURS on the phone to talk talk and by their own admission we have been continuously lied to by agents. Their engineers have apparently been, left no notes and no one can tell us what‚Äôs going on. 10 days services in nearly 4 months is appalling. We have been promised refunds, compensation and the all important manager call back. We NEVER get a call back and we call in every other day for updates. I can never recommend talk talk. Please avoid and save yourself the stress and frustration.",0

"I would 100% recomend pc specialist especially for people who are new to the world of pc's. The website is easy to use and when you are done configurating your build they tell you if it is all compatible and if you have some componenets that are unnecessarily powerful for the build so you do not waste any money components. The only complaint i would have is that it does take a long time to arrive (nearly a month), however I belive this is not down to pc specialist themselves but rather the fact that it is hard to get the parts at the moment. Also when the pc does arrive they send you an email on how to set it up so you do not make any mistakes. Amazing company for people purchasing their first pc.",1

"Watching on a smart TV is terrible. The app crashes, buffers incessantly, displays a poor quality, and shows a blinding bright white screen while it's loading. Watching on PC is even worse. You can't stream directly from their website and are prompted to download the NOW TV Player instead. But if you want to watch something on the NOW TV Player you have to find it using the website! The constant back and forth is such an inefficiency and a waste of time. Definitely the worst streaming platform out there. Avoid avoid avoid.

Edit: They've now decided to run 30 second ads at the beginning of certain programmes even though you pay for the service. Less of a streaming platform and more of an online scam. Massive thumbs down.",0

If I could give zero stars I would. Ordered the GHD on 29th November and expected it within 3-5 days. It was not dispatched until 9th December which was frustrating but given the busy shopping period I was understanding. Hermes emailed to say they had the package and would deliver it. I then received an email from Hermes claiming it was delivered but it had not been. I tracked it and realised that it had not been signed for and it had been left in a ‚Äúsafe place‚Äù - given that my front door is on a busy Main Street I never ask for anything to be left in a safe place. Hermes then sent me a black picture as proof of delivery. I understand this is an issue with the courrier and not GHD however I have now complained to both Hermes and GHD and have received no response and still have no GHD despite paying for it 2.5 weeks ago.,0
"Great service, at a decent price",1

Perfect ! Great product at a fair. Good communications.

"We wanted to use NowTV wifi for when we moved into our new house. It was due to be installed the day I moved in. Someone came to do it, drilled holes in the wall (so now we'll have to pay our landlord for the damage) and then just...left. Without coming back or telling us what was going on.

To add insult to injury, after this event, they told us they'd be back the following week to install everything. A bit annoying, but fine. The next week came and nobody showed. They sent a text to us saying they'd update us in three weeks. Not install it, just update us on when they would. Bearing in mind two of us work from home requiring an internet connection, this just wasn't feasible. My housemate informed NowTV of this and they told us they'd update us the following week. So we waited. The following week, they told us we'd have to wait several more weeks for another update. They never told us what the actual issue was or why it was taking so long to fix. We were kept in the dark about it even after explaining our situation. We grew tired of the rigmarole so we had to find a different wifi provider so we'd be able to get wifi sooner.

Essentially, I do not recommend NowTV for wifi in the slightest. I couldn't tell you what the wifi connection or speed is actually like, because I never actually used it. But the poor customer service and the drama with the installation was enough for us. I've never left a negative review before for anything, but this was just so frustrating I wanted others to be warned.",0
Excellent customer service from Harmony Carter. Nothing was too much trouble and sorted out my order calmly and professionally. Thank you and well done.,1
Great service yet again from HMV. CD arrived on release date despite a postal strike,1

"Initial contact was very good sales person was very helpful and we like the Brand of Dishwasher we ordered so went ahead. We ordered December 13th and delivery date was initially given as December 16th which would have been amazing.

Its been downhill since then. I got a text on December 14th saying delivery would be delayed until the New Year which I accepted. I contacted Customer Service on Dec 29th to see when in the New Year and they said they had requested the stock be moved and I should get an update in 48 hours to book delivery.

Still nothing as Jan 4th so tried again and got the same answer. Now Jan 6th told request was cancelled and I should get an update over the weekend.

So at this point a 2 day delivery is edging toward a month which obviously isn't good enough but also not keen to start with a new supplier at this stage. Just really poor communication with me and within the business after initial positive experience.

Was promised delivery and install January 10th this has now also failed and I have requested cancellation absolutely abysmal experience.",0

"Placed order for 3 x Samsung S22 256gb, x pink, 1 x green & 1 x black website stated 1 - 3 days for delivery for each of the colours. Received order confirmations nothing detailed regarding delivery. There was no temporary passwords for an account as stated but made one anyway. Pink phone was stuck in security checks for 24 hours the other 2 were on Pre order awwaiting stock so called in to check if there was a problem with the pink phone. No problem sometimes with multiple phones it takes a bit longer. Checked on delivery status of other 2 phones and was told maximum 3 days and I would have the handsets. Pink phone changed to Pre Order awaiting stock so I called to see if I could change that to a white one which was detailed as in stock for next day delivery. Colour changed and was told I would receive the next day and 19 handsets in stock. Called back later to change the other 2 phones to white at which point there were only 8 handsets in stock but was assured I would recieve all 3 phones next day. No order updates, no dpd notices for delivery so called back next day to check what was going on. Whilst I was on the phone the green now white changed to packing and likewise the black now white did but not the pink now white. Apparently that hadn't been actioned properly so they changed it again and said still 4 handsets all 3 phones would be delivered next day. Got dpd notifications for green / black now white but nothing again for pink now white and that was still on Pre Order. Called again to see what was going on. Was told that the pink now white had not updated so they changed it again and said will get the next day. Green / black now white was delivered at 5.30pm. Both were connected with Vodaphone and existing sim could be used. Didn't get any updates again for pink now white phone so called again next day. White phones were now out of stock so couldn't have one. No colours were in stock so the agent spoke to manager and called me back to say I could have a refurb phone in colour of my choice delivered next day with a ¬£50 compensation payment which would hit my bank in 3-5 days after dispatch. Asked about Samsung cashback and Disney offers with this phone and was told yes it still applied so said OK I'll have a black one. Got order update and in dispatch notice then discovered refurb handsets are not qualifying products for promos so called them back, they were not prepared to compensate me for the lost offers so i cancelled that one. After a lengthy conversation I agreed as my only option to take a Bora Purple 128gb with the ¬£50 compensation presumably delivery next day. Again no order update, no dispatch notice, no Dpd notices and order still on Pink and Preorder. Called back at 4pm was told it will definitely be delivered next day and dpd can send notices upto 11am. So knowing this was just another fob off as it hadn't been processed I waited till next morning and called back again. Again I was told sorry not been processed so I said well I noticed the website says Bora Purple 256gb was in stick for next day delivery so could I change to that handset. Handset was changed again on system and again told delivery would be next day. Waited all evening for updates but nothing again so I placed a new order completely at 6.46am. By 2pm I had the dispatch notice on the new order so I called to cancel the original order. After waiting 1.5 hrs in queue I had received an order update for the original order but stating Bora Purple 128gb not 256gb. When I finally spoke to someone to cancel that order a recall message was sent to warehouse as it had gone to dispatch, I received dpd notice for new order and that went to connection. I waited on the phone to ensure the 128gb was cancelled but it was too late dpd notice received and that also went to connection. Both phones were delivered next day now Sunday. New order had taken 10 hours from placing order to dispatch. Original order a week and loads of changes and hassle and hours on the phone and in the queue. Was told to refuse delivery of 128gb and it would go straight back to them overnight be checked back in warehouse and cancelled and refund for upfront and compensation would be processed. Refused delivery Sunday 11th December, now 15th December and according to dpd tracking still states Snetterton depot? Will be checking on that. Then I notice on my Vodaphone account that my contract is set up for 4 years instead of 2. This is due to 2 connection notices for my number. Also 1 of the other phones the contract hasn't updated. Called MPD again to sort this on Sunday 11th December. Won't cancel connection order for Purple 128 till they have recieved it back and then it will take about a week to process through. Asked them to send a new / amended connection to vodaphone for the other phone that hasn't updated as MPD cancelled it now 15th December still not done. Not good service",0

"**UPDATE**
Received the phone back from CPW today and powered it up only to notice that it does have visible signs of screen burn but I am 99% sure that this was not present before sending it to CPW for a trade in. I am disgusted if this has been damaged while in their possession. I guess I will never know the truth but what I do know is is that CPW don't seem a very reputable company from the reviews I have read. I will never use them again.

I wanted to trade-in my Google Pixel 3a and had a great offer from Carphone Warehouse of ¬£70. I should have known it was probably too good to be true and after reading many other reviews of people experiencing the same issue and I now feel that I am yet another victim of their trade-in deal. They give you a great quote to draw you in - you post your phone off in great condition and fully working order to then receive an email saying that their engineers have found a fault, in this case, screenburn and would you accept ¬£15 or ask for the phone to be returned. I sent my phone to them in A1 condition with no problems, without even a scratch - it was faultless. I have asked for the phone to be returned to me in the same condition that it was sent but I have little hope of hearing anything back from what I have read elsewhere. Utterly appalling behaviour!! Please could a representative of Carphone Warehouse please contact me to resolve this issue before I take matters further and speak to my solicitor. Thank you.",0
"Completely incompetent. I cancelled broadband and phone line and moved to Virgin Media only to find BT sending me a bill for the next quarter as they hadn‚Äôt cancelled my phone line or my broadband.

"Additional info following Vodafone reply:
I have decided to leave Vodafone as the coverage is terrible. I went back to carphone warehouse and they processed a change from Vodafone to ID mobile. The staff member printed off the Vodafone guidance which was to call them on 191 to request a PAC code which I then enter on IDs website to get my service transferred.
Only Vodafone have cut me off so I can't claim them. Late last night I had a text saying I had to call 191. I can't. I'm cut off.
So I contact the afore-mentioned social media team by message who eventually reply and tell me to.text for a PAC code.
I can't do that.either as I'm cut off.

I've messaged this info back to them and they are ignoring me.

THIS IS WHY I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GIVEN VODAFONE A SECOND CHANCE. THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NON EXISTANT, THEY GIVE CONFLICTING INSTRUCTIONS AND THEN THEY IGNORE YOU.

DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT GO TO VODAFONE UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME.

I'm still.waiting for a response. I'm still cut off. I can't work. I doubt they care.

Didn't even want to give 1 star tbh as they are awful. Got persuaded to switch to them and wish I hadn't.
I currently have no service at all so I can't work.
Tech team slow and spout jargon at you which makes no sense and makes me feel they have no idea.
If not fixed by tomorrow I will be quitting the contract and going back to o2 or ee.
Please please avoid. I was told they'd improved but they haven't. Worse than before if that's possible",0
Nice friendly staff. Gave good advice and opinions. Showed me all my options. No pressure selling. Would recommend to anyone.,1
"Appalling customer service! I recommend that you do not use them!

I purchased a phone which was clearly described as UNLOCKED, however when I put my sim in I got a insert network sim code üôÑFFS!

I contacted them on the Monday (received the phone on the Saturday) and they said they would get me the code in a few days and let me know, Friday rolls around and I haven't heard anything from them! So I had to call them, however they decided to turn their phones off with a automated message saying to email them! Which added to my frustration.

The email I got in response gave me a unlock code, I input the code but it didn't work much to my anger, I contacted them again, but being the Friday I had to wait another weekend, but on Monday they didn't believe me and once again gave me the same code, I had to send photo's proving it wasn't working for them to believe me.

Their phones were still off at this point, so I used messenger, they finally admitted it was the wrong code as they had the wrong IMEI number, so I sent them the correct IMEI number, but again I had to chase them even though they said they would contact me, two weeks had passed by this point.

They then told me that they couldn't unlock the phone, and that was it, no alternatives, no options, just ""we can't unlock your phone"" I was fumming at this point.

They finally turned their phones back on, I got in touch and the customer service operator admitted they lied to me, I asked for the next model up given the inconvenience caused, they refused but offered a lesser phone to add to insult üò°

It was still a good phone and price as I got it in black Friday and it was 'pristine' so I asked if It could be fixed, they said yes, so I sent it back.

But I heard nothing once again, just a automated email saying the phone was received and being checked, then despite contacting them again I still heard nothing on the status of the phone, finally I got a automated email saying I'd been refunded.

So overall absolutely appalling, disappointing, disgusting customer service.

Their website talks about rigerous checks to phones before dispatch etc, but obviously they didn't bother in this case, because I don't see how something so critical to a phones operating could be missed!

At no point did they contact me despite saying they would, I had to do the chasing, they refused to compensate me despite the inconvenience, they didn't believe the unlock code didn't work, just poor poor customer service, not to mention lieing! All this back and forth took nearly a month.

Use at your own risk!",0
Second RAM purchase from Mr Memory. The items arrived promptly and worked as expected. It's been more than 1 year since my first purchase. Very satisfied.,1
"Refused to exchange a product as I was one day out of the returns window, even though the item was not collected (and the purchase completed) until two days after. Total lack of customer care and unwilling to help or listen, completely inflexible. Appallingly rude and uninterested customer service, they will deliberately put you on hold permanently, rather than end the call, so you do not get the opportunity to do the feedback survey at the end of the call.
Will never shop with them again.",0
"I have been with this company for years,recently i became sponsor for Ukranian family ,and when the family arrived i rung this company and i asked them if they have any support for Ukranian families ( in some countries some phone operaters offer some help for Ukrainians ),they ve said no, but they can give me good deal on 1 year contact ,but after 1 month this family decided to move to a relative in another country as the child was struggling alot so ,they dont use the sim card any more so i didnt want to pay something as nobody uses it any more, today i ve rung the company ,explained the situation to staff member,she said that if they cancel the contract ,i have to still pay ¬£146 ( the contact was ¬£16 fee in a month,and I had already paid one month fee so far ) i explained that special circumtances and im only helping others but now they dont live here and i dont want to pay it next 11 months but she didnt want to know about it ,later on i ve spoke to her superviser and he told me the same thing if they cancel it,, i have to pay ¬£146 ,he keeps saying he has no protocol like that and i have to pay it ,it is disappointing that such big company and they can't show any understanding .",0

"DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM CURRYS!

Absolute shambles of a company that used to have an excellent reputation. I don‚Äôt even know where to start!

DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM CURRYS!

DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM CURRYS!

"I have been on a retainer with one of the UK‚Äôs largest magazine companies for the last four years and as part of that agreement with them I have needed to bite my tongue and keep the peace. Well as of a few months ago the company is no longer a carphone warehouse client and I‚Äôm no longer bound so now I can let the fur fly ! and warn others considering moving their business account to carphone warehouse to think twice you‚Äôll regret it if you put your account with them, they are incapable of upholding the promises made by their sales persons.

I have been in the communications industry for nearly thirty years and managed many mobile phone providers and virtual networks for the companies I have contracted for and in all that time I have never come across a company that displays such arrogance and lack of understanding of their own industry. I have also never felt so strongly to wright such a review to enlighten others to what they might be letting themselves in for.

Communications is carphone warehouse‚Äôs core business however they are so poor at communication it is no wonder that so many problems existed for the entirety of the account. The main office is in Poole Dorset and seemingly headed up by disillusioned people with thick skins who probably pat themselves on the back believing they are doing a good job. They truly have no idea how to run an office much less manage accounts. The operations director will pay lip service and come across as someone who wants to resolve problems but the reality is he is as ineffective as everyone else, worse if you try and make contact with head office he seems to be able to intercept that communication and you‚Äôll end up having to deal with them again. We found it impossible to make contact with anyone outside that office.

One example of the problems were, one day we suddenly had a large number of mobiles that couldn‚Äôt make or receive calls. Having called them to report was told that it needed to be emailed into the account manager. They wouldn‚Äôt hear that it was urgent and people needed their mobiles working. A day later having been already given the mobile numbers effected in that email they wanted to know the numbers effected, DUH! Didn‚Äôt they read the email. They also wanted to know the postcodes of where every handset was when it couldn‚Äôt make a call. Sort of seems a reasonable question but they asked at 5pm on day two nearly twenty hours after the first report and when the email came back on day three at midday all we were told was that they thought all the sims were faulty and should be replaced and was that what we wanted them to organise? Again duh! They are meant to know what to do, we are the customer.

Not being satisfied with their suggestion, also beginning to lose the will to deal with them any more and frankly now looking incompetent to my employer because its gone on for so long without any proper diagnosis or even a sensible approach being adopted, I called network directly and reported the problem. It turned out that all the numbers effected had been blacklisted. All were un-blacklisted within a few minutes and all were again working within the hour, even through we were told it could take up to 24 hours.

After an investigation it turned out someone at carphone warehouse had make a mistake and emailed in the wrong list of IMEI‚Äôs. When challenged directly their initial excuse was they were acting on instructions from someone within the company, and when asked for the proof which they couldn‚Äôt provide they reluctantly owned up to the cockup in their office. We never did get a proper apology nor did we get an answer as to why someone had collated our IMEI‚Äôs together.

On another occasion we had a large number staff attend a conference in Europe. When they landed at Madrid none of their handsets worked. Two days without a working mobile amongst them and that turned out to be roaming wasn‚Äôt enabled. Despite their service manager stating several times in email that roaming is on by default and what ever the problem is it wont be that!. In desperation again we contacted the airtime provider and they resolved the matter quickly. In the mean time carphone wanted to replace the sims, we lost count over the course of the contract how many times they used that excuse for a break down in service, it seems to be their go-to solution, probably because it buys them time to allow a problem to fix its self or at least appears that something is being done. We never had a problem in the term of the contract that required a sim replacement to resolve.

These are just two of the dozens of examples of problems with them and their service, most of the other problems relate to slowness of what they call service, delayed responses and when they finally do respond if you don‚Äôt have to keep onto them it is usually to confirm information they have already been provided. Eventually we stopped contacting them and dealt directly with the airtime provider who was more than happy to help and always resolved matters quickly. Carphone warehouse probably thought everything was fine and had no idea that they had in effect been cut from the process.

It seemed as though they buy time with every email because they have no idea what to do. The attention span is short and the attention to detail is even shorter!. Efficient is not a word within their vocabulary. It is quite clear the general bar is low and the management bar is even lower.

So the bottom line is, avoid them and save your self a lot of time and inconvenience. The deal they do might be amongst the lowest you will receive and for us it was very competitive however in the long run it will cost you time and annoyance and you will end up managing them and your account your self so you might as well do a deal direct with the airtime provider and cut out the circus clowns at carphone warehouse.

Every negative review you will read online about carphone warehouse business is well deserved in our experience.

I‚Äôm now with another company and for a short while carphone warehouse was being considered, 350 mobiles very nearly transferred to their control. Thank god I got there in time.

Clueless warehouse was the nickname we gave to them and they earnt it too !",0

"I ordered a laptop which arrived next day no issues. At the time of purchase my laptop came with a deal, buy this laptop and I get free software. After chasing them up for weeks for my 'free' software it then turned out that the product codes they sent me were already used. So 3 weeks in no 'free' software which at the time was a selling point over the same laptop in AO. No free software later, within a month my laptop stopped charging. Called up their team and they said to go to a store and get team knowhow to look at it. Next day, I go to the store and tell them it's not charging the technicians examined the charging port and said that they are in good condition, many laptops come back with the charging pin bent or broken but mine was was still in good condition (only had it for just over a month now almost 2) sent back to their repair centre and given a date of 15th November (1 week) that I can expect my laptop back. Roll over a week later I call them up for an update on where my laptop is, after spending a while looking for my reference number they tell me its waiting for a part to repair and the part was ordered on 10th November. Ok part is delayed I waited another week. On the 22nd November I tried calling again as I no longer recieved any updates. Same news waiting for replacement part no estimated date. On the 4th week called them again, same answer waiting for a part, so I asked for a refund or replacement, and they said I can go back to the store and get a replacement. So I did just that, went to the store and asked for a replacement. The guy who assisted was helpful, he first tried to find out where my original item was on his system and then failing that offered a replacement, as they dont stock my item in store they had to order it in. So stupidly I said ok order it in. On the item collection note, I wasnt given any time or date as to when I can expect my product to arrive. So after 3 working days I went back to the store and asked where my product. They called warehouse and said it wasnt there and the store hasn't received it the staff checked and I should come back at the end of the week. Went back and still my product hasn't arrived, the warehouse team says my item isnt in their prepaid folder so it has left the warehouse, so at the start of the week I was told it wasnt in the warehouse, at the end of the week it still isnt in the warehouse or even in store. After 5 weeks of waiting in queues and waiting for my product I had enough. For any other customer purchases made online, there is free next day delivery to store, yet my item ordered in store takes a week and still it doesnt arrive. I've waited 5 weeks without a laptop to do my work, without any update and just put on hold over and over again. I will be getting a new laptop and I can assure you that even if I purchase it from currys now it will arrive quicker than the time I had to put into getting my money back, in the future I will try to avoid them and will recommend anyone where possible to avoid them too.",0
Was offered ¬£80 for iPhone 11 which I was perfectly honest that it was faulty... I was offered around ¬£30 on another site!

"Hello,

I had a bad experience with this company called Richmond TV Installers.

They owner Ali was very rude and scammed me out of ¬£80. I paid him ¬£100 to mount my Tv and that was all smooth sailing. However he did not mount It properly and my tv was to hanging loosely and was too high. So I called him again saying my TV was mounted to high and the tv is hanging.

We both agreed that it would part of his supposed 3 year warranty and their would be no charge for it. He came over and fixed the tv and that was that.

After I got a call from him, he said I owed him ¬£80. However, I denied that because he agreed it would be part of the warranty and there would be no charge for it.

2 days ago, Ali turns up to my house and let's himself in uninvited. He than ran into my door and entered my bedroom. He started to get aggressive and shouted for the ¬£80. I was scared at the time and told him to leave the property otherwise I will call the police. Whenever I mentioned the police he started to get aggressive.

So I gave in and gave the ¬£80 out of fear. After I gave him the ¬£80 I started to record the situation. When I started recording, Ali said I owed him an additional ¬£40. He started to square up to me until he backed of because he saw he was being recorded. That's when he started to leave the property.

Also to be clear:

There wasn't any type of invoice for the ¬£80. But there was for the ¬£100 which was agreed.

Regards

Seb",0

"Been a customer of Knowhow for a washing machine for over 4 years.
Unfortunately it broke down and started leaking badly on the 27th Feb. I called and registered the issue and was told that an engineer would visit between the hours of 1:30 and 5:50 on 5th March. At 4pm on the 5th my wife received a call from the engineer saying he could not get to the appointment. We were then given another appt for the week after on the 11th.
I called Knowhow and explained and was told that I could get a 7day SLA if I call on the Sunday as the repair had gone over 7 days. I called as per the advise given in good faith and the 7 day SLA was processed. I chased this on the Monday and was told that it had been rejected. Another one was processed and was told we should get the voucher on the 10th. I was to call back again and check. I have been told today that this has also been rejected due to the 7 day SLA not starting from the 5th therefore it would not come into play until the 12th.
I have written to the CEO of Currys and currently have received no response. The fact that this company take your money and then when you need them they move goal posts and let you down is a joke.

Decided on a used camera and lens picked up last Saturday 21-1-23 no battery in box but had been told this but was promised I‚Äôd get a battery ended up with 2 compatible batteries unfortunately 1 wouldn‚Äôt charge and the other did hold a charge very well emailed and this was rectified asap with a nice new canon battery sent,1
Well team knowhow i have never experienced anything like the customer service I have recieved from yourself's I am currently as Im writing this on my 12 call this morning I understand the current crisis we all face in these uncertain times but that does not give you the right to not deal with a damaged TV I recieved from yourself's I paid for a fully working TV not a damaged one!,0
"Richer Sounds matched the Amazon price on the Melomania 1+ earphones I was after, & reserved them for me till next day. Good service from Mike in the Leeds store",1
"Awful experience thus far.

Ordered an item, but it was around ¬£150. My credit card company declined the order and asked for verification. Sure no problem, however it said I should then go ahead and order again.

Fine, but all of a sudden I had two orders processed. Great I'll just return one. However its not 2 days after expected delivery to store. After contacting support they have told me that DPD cannot located the parcel.

I've asked for a refund, and they said no sorry we can't issue a refund until their lost parcel investigation has been completed. Which is a week from now, so a total of 9 days after the expected delivery.

Unacceptable, I'm still trying to get my money back, or the item I paid for.

If you MUST deal with CPW then make sure its directly in store.

Poor experience.",0
"Delivered on time, followed instruction on youtube and they were very helpful, its been 2 weeks and it works perfectly.",1
Good plugins are great rates I would recommend them to anyone üëåüèΩ,1
"Happy with the service, quick with the service, and reliable,. Thankyou.",1
"Really really easy to deal with , made the whole purchase so so simple . Great contract for an amazing price . The new product turned up less than 24 hours from ordering . Very pleased with the whole experience",1
"In August last year I entered into a contract with I D Mobile for mobile phone services. I was unable to activate the service and after 3 hours I rang to cancel the contract. I D Mobile is a branch of the Carphone Warehouse.
Below is a copy of the transcript of the closing of my account dated August 4/2020.

It goes without saying that despite what is stated below Carphone warehouse are still charging me my monthly fee for a service they have never provided.
Do not give this company any of your bank details as they will have you over a barrel for eternity.

Hi Patrick, how can I help you today?

Shaabira:
I haven't heard from you for a while. Do you wish to continue our chat?

patrick: I have just spent an hour and a half trying to keep my number without any luck. I now wish to cancel this contract. When i started trying to keep the number I was within a 14 minute window I am now in a 2 hour window
Shaabira:
Thank you for contacting us today. I am so sorry to hear that you would like to cancel the contract as you are unable to process the number transfer. Would you like me to check if I am able to process the transfer for you before you cancel?

patrick: no thank you I have tried to long for that had you answered my telephone call instead of redirecting me here the situation would have been resolved immediately it is now too late fior that i just want this very bad experience behind me.
Shaabira: I completely understand what you are saying. I can only but imagine how you are feeling.

I would be happy to assist and have the contract canceled. May I ask if you are the account holder?
patrick: yes i am the account holder
Shaabira:
Before we get started, I need to ask you a couple of security questions. Please fill in the form I'm about to send you. Once you have entered the information, press submit.

Shaabira:
Perfect! That matches our records. Thanks for taking the time to do this.

Shaabira:
Thank you for waiting Patrick. I have accessed the account and can confirm that you are within 14 days cooling-off period. I will be processing the return for you. Please give me one moment.

Shaabira:
Thank you for waiting. The SIM has been recorded as returned in the system. The Pay Monthly Contract will be disconnected within 10 minutes.
Do not throw away the SIM card as it will be converted to a Pay As You Go SIM within 10 minutes. You are able to continue using the SIM as PAYG, but it will require a Top-Up.

Can you confirm that you understand all of the information I have just read to you, and do you have any questions?

patrick: yes I understand and no i have no further questions. i am sure if i had chatted with you at 10:58 I would still be with iD have a nice day

This girl has a right attitute & skills of customer handling . Shell need more stars like this .. :) Best wishes to all . Thanks GK",1
Great product that was good quality. A very quick delivery Very easy to customize.,1
Great to be able to get an immediate response. I found a helpful person on the other end of my tweets and got a result by the end of the day. Fault fixed !!,1
Quick and easy to use was this first time I had used it,1
Always happy with the experience. Staff ask if help is needed very quickly and everyone is always knowledgeable.,1
"Will pressure you to join and promise all sorts of benefits that do not exist in reality. Had to get new kitchen floor and cupboards after washing machine was installed incorrectly. No support from knowhow and same mistake caused over and over again until an engineer I contacted myself rectified their mistake in 30 seconds. They had connected to wrong, lower water inlet causing flooding and dirty water from sink to flood into washing machine and out onto floor when washing machine door was opened. Failed to spot their mistake after several visits. An alternative engineer from another company was shocked at such a 'schoolboy error'.",0
"Quick efficient, paid quickly. Thank you üëçüëç",1
"I ordered 2 samsung galaxy phones in carphone warehouse's store, during the ordering process we were not told that sim phones cannot be refunded and was told that the delivery will arrive within 2 days. My husband took 2 days off work to stay at home and waited for the delivery and nothing arrived. We then cancelled the order online due to the late delivery and ordered else where instead. We spoke to an online operator and was told the driver did attempt to deliver but that is a lie as no one called up. Its been roughly 2 months now and not only have we not been refunded but up to now carphone warehouse is still attempting to deliver the phones to our address which we keep rejecting. We definitely will never be going back to carphone warehouse. And seeing the lack of responses they have to other peoples reviews, it just shows they don't value customers as much as they say. I hope i get a reply which i highly doubt i will.",0
Fantastic service within this store as always.,1
"This a formal complaint as to the service I have received from NowTV posted here since no1 replies to emails and your chat room can't help!

On several occasions I have been shocked that a well known provider such as yourselves could allow your customer service to be so shambolic. I can recall 2 specific situations where I have attempted to speak to someone regarding being unable to access my account only to be ultimately told there was nothing that could be done. There was no real interest in helping and it did not help that this online messaging, whilst convenient to most, feels highly impersonal and resembles a robotic service at best.

So exhausted am I at having to deal with your services that I do not intend to ramble on about the most frustrating accounts I have had. What I will simply say is that as your customer I now demand the below:

1) A proper explanation as to why you system is so poorly designed that I cannot simply reset my password and access my account without all this madness, and still I cannot log in;
2) This response needs to happen in a timely manner as once again I have paid for a service that I have no way of using and finally;
3) A refund for the months of paying for this service and not being able to access the account.",0
"I bought my first hifi system from Richer Sounds over 40 years ago and have never purchased equipment from anywhere else. Excellent service as always. I also 100% agree with all that Julian Richer stands for. A thoroughly decent man. If I decide to upgrade yet again in the future, it'll be from here. This time it was online, but previously from Cardiff, Chester and originally Tower Bridge. Always a great experience.",1
The new broadband box is garbage it‚Äôs cut out and needed reset 3 times within 3/4 weeks had other box for 3 years never a issue with it,0
The game did not even last 5 mins of my son playing it as it was totally scratched. Very upset 4 year old for Christmas.,0
Delivered on time and phone exactly as described. Good price,1
"Great experience, great srtvice",1
Excellent quick and efficient !,1
"I've spent the past week trying to sort out an address issue as I'm trying to buy the pixel 7 pro which would be an upgrade on the vodafone network for me.

I keep getting told that my address is not matching the one on vodafone database, yet I've sent proof showing that is precisely the same.

I've spent hours over 9 phone calls with MPD (waiting time is over 30mins) and although the staff have been friendly, I am nowhere nearer to the order being fulfilled.

There is no way to speak to anyone further up. and after each chat, the guys at MPD sends an email to their higher-up team to find out what's going wrong, and then i just get an email saying ""your addresses don't match"" yet, they do. I am sure this is a simple issue to sort, but I'm not getting any assistance with this simple actual error.

I've spoken to Vodafone online and on phone calls, have even popped into vodafone shops and looked at my address, tried to tweak it and it's all correct. and yet, the MPD ""computer says no"", and there seems to be no way of escalating this issue, even though I have proof via my bills which I've emailed over.

It is infuriating, and a shame as this deal is cheaper with MPD, and it should come with a free ¬£300 pixel watch, but if this deal falls through (which is looking likely) I will sadly lose out.

I am sure there is something simple, but without the ability to speak to the higher up team, this is sadly turning into a waste of my time. If anyone can help, please please get in touch as time is running out!",0
You will be hard pressed to find a better deal than this. I am well pleased with my purchase and will repeat it in the future.,1
Our product arrived in time . Helpful video on installation. A nice company to do business with. üëç,1
"Easy to navigate site, speedy delivery.",1
Very happy with the custom laptop. Perfect for work and home. Very easy to order.,1
"Deceitful company, stated despatched, but wasn't until 5 days later, make all excuses under the sun and fail to send confirmation of transaction and order, plus they procrastinate like hell when you ask for refund. My advice, is avoid and use more reputable company, fortunately paid thru PayPal so pursuing claim. In one word USELESS",0
"Really easy to order, download and install!",1
"Absolutely brilliant.
Put my question/concerns and Samir M was able to resolve it all.
Had been a bit worried as how to do this as no telephone number for customer services.
Thank you",1
"They were polite, very helpful and provided a efficient service right through to delivery",1
Emailed gtech on a sunday got a reply next day. Problem was solved within 3 days.,1
"Terrible service. A sim only, upgrade deal purchased from Carphone Warehouse and before a sim was even activated, never mind sent out, my partners phone was cancelled. Leaving her stranded with out any means of contacting people or being contacted.

Despite pointing out the flawed system to the customer care adviser, they were not interested in helping or fixing their flawed system. As soon as you agree to a new deal, they automatically cancel your current line, leaving you with no service on your phone.

Not even a courtesy offer of anything to help the situation.

All of this leading to a cancellation, yet the old sim is still left not working and blocked. Five days are needed to unblock the sim, with no attempt to prioritise customer care.

Will not be using mobiles.co.uk or Carphone Warehouse again.
BEWARE!",0
Birthday invitations. Great company to use. Ordering was easy and straightforward. Was kept informed from ordering to delivery.,1
"I have shopped with Studio for a few years now and i have always had good items from you,summer items and winter items,and they have all been very good,keep up the good work,and i will still be buying from you,",1
"Excellent service friendly staff
Happy with the product",1
"Fantastic price, fast and professional. Excellent !",1
"Vodafone emailed me in October offering a broadband upgrade or contract renewal fixed for a further 24 months fixed at the existing price ¬£24 a month. So I accepted the renewal. Seven days later I received an email cancelling my order, no explanation!!
Didn't bother contacting anyone just accepted it.
Then in December exactly the same offer, so accepted it again. Guess what?..........seven days later the same email saying the order has been cancelled, no explanation!!
So this time I have cancelled my broadband contract and I am moving to another supplier.
Why offer deals which you don't honour?
Why don't you explain why this happened?
You have lost a new 24 month contract, which I am sure doesn't bother such a large organisation, but it should.",0
ITEMS ORDERED GOOD QUALITY. QUICK AND EASY TO BUY ONLINE.,1
"Brilliant, easy to use website and fab quality calendars!",1
"Excellent service and value, thanks.",1
"Virgin are shocking! Absolutely regret switching from Sky. The call centre is based in Cape Town and they really don‚Äôt give a damn. They hang up, transfer you to departments that cant assist and generally fob you off. After 9-10 calls/attempts to resolve broadband coverage, billing issues and an O2 sim not being delivery, we still haven‚Äôt resolved two of the problems. Going to switch back to a company that has far superior customer service. The two engineers (to be far were good) but now we‚Äôre get charged for installation which was sold as free! Avoid virgin they‚Äôre certainly not the company they once were!

Virgin have setup the security details with O2 which means we don‚Äôt have them so can‚Äôt access the account. Catch 22!",0
"Paid for GHD hot brush and gift set. Money was taken out straight away. 8 days later no parcel, and the money was refunded. Tried contact GHD and no reply or help. Checked website and what I ordered had now sold out. I‚Äôm panicking as it was a Christmas gift and still hadn‚Äôt arrived! So I had no choice but to go buy the item from another place I tracked down which cost me more money. Another week passes, suddenly I realise my bank account has been deducted just before pay day and it‚Äôs GHD back in taking the money again and then suddenly an email saying it will be with me next day. Again it was, another 3 days went past and was delivered to wrong address also. I‚Äôm more annoyed at fact I got not help, no email to say it was definitely coming and to take the money out, refund then take it again weeks later when I had no idea it was coming out and I had already bought a new one!!",0
My package arrived on time. And it‚Äôs perfect ü§©,1
"If I could leave no stars I would!! I haven‚Äôt bought a phone from Carphone Warehouse and now probably never will. I rang them on the day I got my first email congratulating me on my new phone to tell them I hadn‚Äôt bought a new phone and to check that no one has been fraudulently using my bank card, only to be told in no uncertain terms by some nasty female that they wouldn‚Äôt have ‚Äúbecause the address wouldn‚Äôt match the name and that they must have the wrong email address‚Äù - end of conversation!! No sorry, we‚Äôll change/clear the email address then as it‚Äôs clearly wrong, just constant annoying emails from Carphone Warehouse. Absolutely shocking customer service.",0
"Excellent company. Easy to use website.
They send the packaging to your address, then you take item to post office and retain tracking number.
They keep you updated by email of the process taking place.
The price I was quoted was the amount I received in my bank account.
This company are professional, efficient and trustworthy. I will use them again and have no hesitation in recommending them to family and friends .",1
Big shout out to Henry at Lewisham branch. Excellent customer service.,1
I wouldn‚Äôt even give half a start let alone one. Kept asking BT to change my bill date to collaborate with my pay date and kept getting told no. Fair enough but these seem to think paying ¬£67.00 per month for Broadband is acceptable?? When it was only supposed to be ¬£30. I have just changed my package to a different company with exactly the same thing BT offers me for only ¬£21.00pm. I don‚Äôt know how companies are continuously allowed to rip people off and get away with it!!! I constantly tried to set a DD up always and kept getting denied to do so all because they want that extra money they charge you for not paying DD. Company is a rip off and a joke!!!!!,0
Quick and speedy delivery and kept informed of when delivery would be.,1
"Would give zero stars for the run around carphone warehouse is given me. Done an upgrade online nearly 3 weeks ago, DPD managed to loose my phone, managed to eventualy talk to someone who talked to DPD, they had 48 hours to pay carephone warehouse the value of the phone then ithey would send a new phone, never happend. Ive e-mailed been given links to follow spoke to 2 gurus, one cut me off the other fobed me off both said get back to us in an hour.... can i get hold of one,2 hours going in circles on their site, you cannot get any form of contact with this company, unless you WANT TO BUY A PHONE AND GIVE THEM MONEY, then no problem, want to ask a question, i am actualy wondering if they ate blocking me somehow. Cant even get to cancel the contract have been trying to do that too now my 14 days have passed.
Disgusted and frustrated by the poor service if i can get out of this contract ill never deal with you again",0
"Excellent service.
Engineer arrived on time, new exactly what the problem was, had the new part available and all fixed within 15 minutes.
100% would recommend.
Thank you",1
"Super cool, get to engage with brands and learn from others!!",1
"BT customer service 0800 011 3151 or 0800800150 no longer exists, they will not take any call for any problems, (Voice message saying ""due to high call volumes we cannot take your call, try again later"" been trying for a month.

BT deserves to have its license revoked, fed up talking to useless robots. Huge profits and overpaid greedy management but cannot be bothered with customer service.I urge every customer to cancel direct debit and this bring this pathetic company to it knees. They will say contact us via facebook or twitter W-T-F, no more automated robots. You deserve zero.",0
"Buyer beware, I ordered a dongle so my son could do homework when staying at his nans, the device was not delivered.
Can‚Äôt fault customer services both times I called were very helpful and have now closed my account with them.
The reason for this is due to the fact they tried to take ¬£62.44 out of my bank today for a device that cost ¬£13 per month. Check your direct debits if you intend on ordering from this company. Luckily I spotted it before it left my account and was able to cancel it.",0
"Delighted with my recent purchase of a fire suite.
Would definitely recommend studio for quality goods at reasonable prices",1
Brilliant! Thank you! Wish id spoken to you 10 days or so ago! Such a stressfull time the past week! Thanks again Daniel A. for solving my problem very quickly and listening to a very distressed customer! You're a star!üòÄ,1
"The whole Argos experience is negative. There is no way to filter out of stock items. Also, immediately I placed my order I realised that the system had reverted to the default size which would not fit me. I instantly tried to cancel the order i.e. Within one minute. Because it was a piece of Tu clothing the system does not allow cancellation. You have to wait until the item is delivered to the store, deliberately neglect to pick it up, then wait for 10 days plus to get a refund to your card. Absolutely insane. I will eventually spend the money on my Argos gift card, but after that I will never use Argos again. The whole system is incredibly badly thought out.",0
Excellent product at a really good price and the support for my product - Scaler 2 on the Plug-in Boutique website is excellent as well. Highly recommend this company. üëç,1
The microwave was broken on delivery and the electrician therefore unable to fit it.,0
Hello. I bought my phone ( google 6 pro)last week with ¬£150 cashback deal. Guy at currys said Im gonna recive it in next few days but still didnt recive any money. Also when I asked this guy can I inssurance my phone he said currys do not do with phones just with laptops. I checked online and it was option for ¬£5 a month...can You tell me what I have to do to get my cashback back?,0
I have been with Talktalk for about 28 months I'm pleased with the service they offer,1
"So after multiple calls & watts app messages the cheque for a refund arrives or rather about 10% of the refund from when I was incorrectly billed. I now need to wait another 30 working days for the rest to hopefully arrive. Why this cannot be paid more swiftly via a bank transfer I have yet to receive an answer for despite asking multiple times? Waiting months & having to have multiple conversations to get this error sorted is really very poor customer service. Most companies can sort a refund in a few days or on the day, not a few months, why virgin cannot do the same I am not sure and would be interested to know why?",0
Fantastic service. Received the money two days after postage. Would highly recommend.,1
I bought two phones from quick mobile fix and they have come in good time and exactly as described if not better very good prices and I love that I can pay of no interest to with lay-by great Present if buying for Xmas or birthday prices are great to,1
Terrible customer services. It's about time you were using British staff for customer services who speak good English.,0
They provided an excellent product at a very competitive price and first class delivery service keeping us informed,1
The engineer was good and the machine is up and running again.,1
"I got a quote online 2 days later I took my phone to the nearest Kiosk, phone was inspected and money was paid straight into my account with 30 minutes. No time wasting with people who try to rip you off. Recommend this company to everyone absolutely brilliant. I also bought two iPhones from the same company on to different dates.",1
Very friendly and accommodating. Their advise was perfect. Will now always use RICHER for sounds!,1
"Got a washing machines delivered and installed, great customer service would highly recommend these two lads again!
Thanks Sharon",1
"I ordered the wrong FitBit for my grandson so unfortunately I had to return it to you. I was concerned that with the postal strike it might be a problem getting the return credited in time. However, you have acknowledged the return and assured me that the usual 28 return window was being extended anyway due to the current situation. I couldn't ask for much better service. Waiting for credit but thank you.",1
Does exactly what it says on the tin. A very prompt service.,1
"Although my parcel got lost in transit, they paid what was owed to me for selling my goods swiftly without any issues. I‚Äôm grateful for the smooth transaction in the end, following a nightmare 3 weeks trying to track the parcel.",1

Robin explained it all to me to set my mind at rest and sorted the estimate side of it out, I did have a bit of a melt down at one point as I had been worrying ( I am 75 ) which was embarrassing but again she calmed me down and has straight away sent me an email with options of support and ways to keep me on track and understand how things work, so many thanks Robin",1
"Great Service Start to finish, Game arrived well packaged and works perfectly.",1

"Purchased a Silentnight Toulouse single divan bed in June 2022 for my 11 year old boy. The bed frame twisted and the legs bent under and started to collapse. This happened and was reported within 4 months.
Argos have refused to even look at the bed let alone repair or replace it. They claimed the legs had been forced. (The bed has only been used for 4 months, never been moved and is used by a child who is very quiet - it‚Äôs meant to be suitable for adults!!!) They have also ignored my written letter of complaint. I‚Äôm going through trading standards now.",0
"Shell Energy send notification of a very significant increase in our home energy DD despite the account being in credit. This was queried via their website mailing system. Next day 'Adnan O' phoned regarding this issue, Shell having reviewed the account details and agreed that no DD increase was required and no increase of the DD would be made. This issue was therefore satisfactorily resolved. Adnan O was very efficient, helpful, professional and friendly in dealing with this matter which was originally a computer generated change.",1

"I changed my mind regarding their broadband when I placed the order and cancelled it. Yet not only did I have them attempt to set up a direct debit, but they tried to deliver the router and still sent an engineer out. After speaking to them again I was assured this time it was cancelled and sent confirmation of this. Then they just now phoned me trying to arrange an installation date. Diabolical. Avoid.",0

I ordered a product that was apparently delivered by yodel. The product was not delivered to the specified safe place but instead left on my back door step which is not secure.

It's even worse applying to be a a deliveroo courier, applied to deliveroo over 7 weeks ago the same time as Amazon and Uber eats, been delivering for them for over 5 weeks now and deliveroo are still requesting I add them on my zego insurance policy which zego will not do on a 30 day policy. I have informed deliveroo of this and that just ignore me and keep requesting the same information. I email back to inform them of zegos response to the request and get absolutely nowhere but the same request, pathetic deliveroo, come on get your act together this is turning into a terrible experience they Ng to deal with you.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY! THEY ARE NOTHING BUT THIEVING SCAMMING B@STARDS! Bank chargeback or small claims court is the only way you‚Äôll get your money back. One year later and I‚Äôve no phone and no money but I do have a court date üôå Join the Facebook group for more.,0
"Explain why it's taking this long for a company to refund several amounts of people. Clearly all they seem to do for their explanation is write ""sorry about this, don't hesitate to contact us via...."" and then put down their email which I HAVE DONE but got no response. I expected my refund today and I have no refund. I will contact my bank to get through for this and I don't recommend them at all. It takes additional services such as court and the banks to get then to fix up.",0
"Same experience as many here, have been charged for unwanted passes after signing up for broadband. These charges exceed the cost of the service I actually want but so far have proved impossible to cancel. I have been told that they must be linked to an old account (they're not) and without access to this imaginary account, nothing can be done. They are quite insistent with this fictional account thing, despite me having the same, single email address for over 10 years and the fact that they have taken charges from a debit card that's just 3 months old. Only advice I was given was to cancel my payments and chase a refund through my bank. It is just unacceptable when you consider the amount of alternative providers to whom people could give their hard earned cash that Now TV continue to treat their customers this way. Currently 1 and a half hours into an unfruitful attempt to cancel my broadband to prevent any unwanted payments being taken again. Cut off by staff at every crucial juncture and have to start the whole process again. My advice, don't take the risk on Now TV but if you do, regularly check your bank account to see if their greasy hands have been picking your virtual pockets.",0

"I left Vodafone for Virgin just over a year ago after being with them for a decade. The prices were just too high, especially for existing customers compared to the deals newbies were offered.

Since then my vodafone telecoms account is till showing up on my credit report as an active account, I have contacted them twice about it. The first time I was told that I was actually due a small refund, however they had never sent me a bill or contacted me to let me know, funny how the are not quick to point out when they owe you money.

Once that was dealt with I was assured it would come off of my credit file within a couple of months, fast forward 10 months and its still there. Their customer service has always been pretty terrible in my experience but not updating peoples credit files is shocking.",0

Also customer service on the phone is a whole bunch of catch 22s so nothing gets fixed or sorted",0

Appalling treatment by Carphone Warehouse. Received a text informing me my repair was complete and to give 48hrs before collecting from store. Went to pick it up yesterday to find they had not repaired it at all! Reported moisture damage which is nonsense! The phone simply died when I was using it in dry conditions. I only took the phone out in November. A 2 year contract but the phone only lasts a quarter of that time. Not fit for purpose. Why send a text saying the repair is complete? How misleading was that?!,0

"Have been a customer for four years. Thankfully no issues. Until two days ago, when the internet stopped working. Have sat on hold with no answer, spoke to 4 people over the chat function which after 45 minutes each they seem to stop being able to see my replies and state that I have stopped replying. I have tried every troubleshooting thing they have asked. The last person told me to ‚Äòhold on there‚Äôs a process‚Äô. Yes I‚Äôm well aware of the chat process by this point. Then it went past nine and they closed the chat.. I assume to go home? Talk talk will be loosing a customer. I will not be negotiating the leaving fee.

Never use car phone warehouse it seems to be one big scam. That is my experience after two phones with them.,0
"Ordered Tuesday 7th and paid for next day delivery. Package didnt arrive on the 8th so I checked the parcel status and was told that the delivery driver had problems with his satnav so could not find my house. Customer support asked if I could provide landmarks etc (My house is in a housing estate and no delivery driver has had an issue before), I told them to use Googlemaps, you'd think that being able to follow directions (even from a A-Z map would be a requirement of a delivery driver).

Next day (Thursday) I now see the tracking status of the driver (I dont think they sent it out Wednesday and used the satnav as an excuse). I was 81st in the queue however the driver must have had an accident or something because the site stopped updating at delivery 41, his van was in a field and didnt move all day (I hope he is ok!).

Friday - nothing.

Its now Monday 13th, nearly a full week after ordering using next day and it has still yet to arrive.

Go else where like Overclockers, the delivery company Ebuyer use (Yodel) dont have the staff with the ability to deliver a parcel.",0

Yodel website now says that parcel is at their depot awaiting driver. Monday comes round and the Yodel website still says at depot waiting for driver. I called Ebuyer 3 times from 12 noon onwards for some more info and was told that Yodel would be contacted and then someone would get back to me. This never happened. On my 3rd time of calling I was told that you had to give Yodel 24 hours to respond and that the problem had only been raised today. I was left very embarrassed as I couldn't give my customer any details at all about something he required very urgently. All I could say is that it might turn up at some point, very unhelpful. I know couriers are busy this time of year and I know on occasion things go wrong, but to literally have no feedback at all regarding the delivery is absolutely hopeless. It is now Tuesday and we cross our fingers that some news may be forthcoming.",0

"No internet since 25th ( Monday)of July, first they said they gonna fix the problem by the 28th ( Thursday), got to that date nothing was done I call BT again, the said was because engineers went on strike they would fix by the weekend, so the weekend pass by nothing, call BT again, aparently they lift a fault for weak signal, I never said that what did I reported was no connection at all with a purple light on the hub, that being said, aparently no one did nothing about cause the report was a week signal, and I said "" if it was a week signal you should be doing something about anyway, you promised speeds at 48mbs minimum and I never got even that from the beginning"". So call them again cancel my contract earlier, that should end by 24 of September anyway changing for Virgin Media, so BT charge me 49¬£ for only broadband at speeds of 68mbs ( so they say) Virgin Media offers me 500mbs TV channels at 36¬£ so is a no-brainer. After BT realise that I was with no internet since the 25th (this was 2weeks without internet and a lot to f phone calls) they send me the ""amazing"" mini hub, well that's fine to check your emails and that it, that's not near good enough for me I like to stream, I love play games and I buy them all digital of course that mini hub is to slow for downloading any big file. So BT book a appointment for engineer at the 13th of August that one was cancelled, so after another phone call they arranged for the 16th so when that engineer came we couldn't do anything cause the fault is outside need to be openreach, So basically BT assuming that the fault would be in the house a cable or the internet filter, without after 20 days never bordering to check it, call BT again, is this lady saying stuff like "" I can see you have a mini hub"" or "" they said they gonna fix it in the next 48 hours"" So basically the mini hub is not good enough for what I do,and about the 48 hours I don't mind to wait 2 days but the problem is another 2 dayson the top of another 20 days. I have been with BT for 6 years never again, never missed one payment or anything they already emailed my bill of course BT is always in time for that, now waiting for 20+ days to have my service back, now my question is what would happen if I was 20 days late on my bill BT? Yeah we all know. Ps: Just to let anyone know, the BT help support ask you to go to Facebook or Twitter for help, do not brother doing that I send a pm text like 7 hours ago and no answer or even bother to open my message, this is just to keep you quiet, what a joke of company.",0
I feel like I was scammed by them. I can not return the phone in-store due to Covid? Webchat is not working and their call center line is crackling and you can not understand a single word. I tried to ring them 5 times and there is no way you can understand what they are saying. Vodafone says I have to speak with them to return the phone. I am going to send them a paper letter as this is literally the only option right now. I have 14 days to return it and no help at all from their side. This is a case that should end up on the consumer rights solicitor desk.,0

Vodafone is the worst company to exist. Their internet drops out every 15 minutes. I have gone and jumped through their many hoops and they still REFUSE to fix it. Honestly a waste of my money and time. Useless company that don't bother to do anything. All these reviews you see are true reflection of how crap they are.

Also have been told by one telephonist that repairs are still going ahead so 8 weeks!!!! They have my number and all contact details but nothing. This TV will be out of warranty at this rate and we should of been refunded 3 months ago
Part 2) great standard response but still nobody knows where the tv is? Ace",0
"I wish I could attach the email chain for people to see how bad this company are at communicating. They don‚Äôt answer questions, take about a week to respond and the responses have no consideration of what you have sent them. I placed 2 order's. One I cannot fault but the other has just been a nightmare over the past month and a half trying to resolve the issue. I was sent either a customer return or a display item with damaged packaging and filthy contents within it. In the end I have had to go to my bank and claim under section 75 for my money back. Disgusting from a company like GHD you expect better.",0

"Item received very quick, well packaged and just what I wanted. Thank you!",1
"I have a faulty item and when cpw finally responded, it was this:


Looking at your order, I can see that you are outside of the 30 day faulty exchange period to have the item exchange as well as outside of the 14 day returns period to have the item returned.

I can only recommend that you visit your local Carphone Warehouse store and find out if any assistance can be offered

Now I‚Äôm fairly sure that is not what the CONSUMER RIGHTS ACT 2015 states.

Dreadful service.

You can see from the reply below the impression that they might care but unfortunately I have already replied twice to them and still no reply so I‚Äôm afraid it looks like the customer service is smoke and mirrors or still just non-existent.",0

I got double from Mazuma than I got quoted anywhere else for my phone. The envelope to send it to them arrived fast and the day they received it I got paid for it that night - and I got paid the amount they quoted for it. I'm impressed and happy.,1
"You book a slot for collection and when you book, they say it will not take more than 5 days or they'll keep you informed. As 5 days was not an option for me, i gave them 7 days. I didnt book anything for the following Saturday so i could be around to wait for the return. I didnt get any update or text message tge previous day as i thought they must have forgot. So i gave them till midday on the day of the item to be return before calling them. Only to realise they only ordered the parts on the Friday and will take 3-5 days for the parts to be delivered then it needs to be installed and then tested before it can be delivered back to me.. i was furious as that will mean i will be without the TV for 3 weeks minimum.. as i can only be at home on weekends as people do need to work and their 6 hour delivery window is absolutely stupid. Even if they contacted me or given me a text on Thursday, i could have planned to do something on the Saturday which has now wasted my entire day.

So just to warn others that what they promise is utterly rubbish, dont keep you updated and overall disappointed..",0
"Exemplary customer experience

I arrived for my listening session to find the room set up and ready to go with the systems I wanted to audition. Darren was extremely knowledgeable and helpful, made me feel completely at ease about repeated comparisons, and ultimately made a tricky decision much easier.

On enquiring about tracking details I was upgraded to priority delivery unasked, which was a particularly nice touch.

Finally, the installed speakers look and sound incredible, which rounds off a wholly excellent purchasing experience",1

So the driver left and Delivero didn‚Äôt refound me trying to find excuses.
So the point is that I AM NEVER GOING TO ORDER THROUGH DELIVERO and You better don‚Äôt order because they just still money and find excuses not to refund. Not professional.

Placed my order on 20th November 2020 and after a month of receiving nothing asked for my order to be cancelled and refunded. Its now 28 Jan 2021 and after several emails back and forth I still don't have any refund.

Purchased a phone in Carphone Warehouse on Henry Street yesterday which was Monday 15/7/2019. Was looked after by a woman called Ailish(hopefully I've got her name spelled right) extremely helpful member of staff very professional welcoming mannerly etc. Would highly recommend anybody looking for help choosing a phone or even a bill pay plan to definitely drop into the Henry Street branch beside arnotts and the Skechers shop facing Debenhams at the ilac and ask for Ailish. As far as I am aware these staff members get comission and this particular staf member worth every penny,1
"I have ordered two phones from this company to date. I had no issues with the delivery of the first phone which I ordered on Black Friday in 2018. In fact when the phone malfunctioned I was able to return it within the warranty and it was repaired and returned promptly. Having had success I ordered a second phone on Black Friday 2020 and what a mistake that has turned out to be. We are now three months down the line and I still have no phone. Far from the 7-10 working day dispatch time! The confirmation of order email stated that there were limited staff numbers due to COVID and government guidelines but a three month delay seems incredibly excessive. What I find even more frustrating and unbelievable is that the company has not once contacted me to update me on my order without me having to email them first to ask for an update. They have offered a refund but I am now unable to afford a replacement as the Black Friday deals have come and gone. It seems very much as if the company are attempting to sell phones before they actually get stock in. I have been willing to accept an alternative phone of the same or better specification but the company are not willing to offer a different device, despite having several for sale on their website and having held my money all this time. Despite the success of my first order I definitely do not recommend buying a phone from this company. Unless something changes drastically my family and I will be steering well clear in all future purchases.",0

"Shocking experience with Virgin and will never use again. I signed up for business broadband and was given an activation date of 6 weeks after my sign up. I was in no rush so didn't care about the wait, external works were due to take place before activation and I was supposed to get a date as to when an engineer would be out. I did not recieve any communication about an engineer and the initial date I was given passed. I was then in contact with customer services who gave me a date this time for the engineer but said my activation would be delayed a full month. Obviously I was not happy about this but I arranged to be at home and take the day off work to be here when the engineer arrived. The engineer did not show up so I phoned to basically cancel everything as this is now 7 weeks into the process. 1 week later and I still had not heard from anyone to confirm my order was cancelled. An engineer phoned my mobile this morning stating he was outside my house to do work. I told him I had cancelled and would not be using Virgin. Had to phone again this morning to ask why my order was still not confirmed as being cancelled.

Worst customer service I have recieved in quite some time and that's saying something. The disappointing thing is virgin had sent two guys out to cut a chunk out of the pavement in front of my property to install something which is an eyesore that is not even required for the company I have since chosen to proceed with.

Branson would need to wipe his Cheshire cat smile of his face and concentrate a little less on his ""woke"" airline ads and get someone to sort the imbeciles he has working for his broadband services. Shocking, do not use Virgin.

*in response to generic reply Dan below*

I have already been in contact with your company via chat and your pathetic automated call centre on multiple occasions to no avail. What sort of communication methods are those you have given, twitter? Who am I asking for on that you Dan? Bit of a broad platform to use to sort customer complaints. I emailed your customer service complaints team weeks ago and received an automated reply to say someone would be in contact within 48 hours, still no reply. Also requested everything be canceled and was told I would recieve an automated reply when it had been done, still no reply... Virgin are the worst avoid.",0
"I decided to change from Virgin Media as I was informed I could get City Fibre broadband in my area - 900mb/s for ¬£36 a month. I was previously ¬£96 a month for half the speed with Virgin, so this was an absolute winner. I now wish I never bothered.

I had nothing but problems from day 1. From my broadband not going live when it should have, to contacting customer services and being passed from pillar to post (mostly to the wrong departments) spending hours on the phone in the process, to being hung up on or blatantly lied to.

I spent 4 hours the day my broadband was due to go live, speaking to numerous different departments as no one could find my account - I hadn't been given an account number, and searches with my address and name apparently yielded no results. I eventually found out from Order Management that my order hadn't been completed and was told this would be sorted and my broadband would go live within 20 minutes. 24 hours later, still nothing. When my broadband eventually did go live (about 48 hours later), I couldn't get the Amazon Eero Pro WiFi hub they provided to connect to most of my smart home devices after hours and hours of trying. As far as google searches are concerned, this seems to be a known problem.

So I decided to cancel the whole thing as it wasn't worth the hassle. Again, no one could find my account as I STILL had no account number (despite having live broadband???). On one occasion I was passed through to a non-customer facing department. On another was told I'd be transferred to Order Management, and ended up at Technical after waiting almost 45 minutes. Numerous other occasions I was hung up on. I must've tried about 7 or 8 times to cancel before someone finally managed to get my details via the Order Management department, and advised they had placed a cancellation on my account. The following day, I then received an E-mail with an account number, and to advise my account had been fully set up and activated. This prompted me to call customer services back just to double check the cancellation had actually been placed on my account and, low and behold, it hadn't.

I have FINALLY managed to cancel, and have been told this will take 30 days to go through, but I'm still sceptical this will actually happen. Honestly this is hands down the worst customer service I've ever received from a company in my life. Maybe I've just been unlucky, but I absolutely would NOT recommend TalkTalk to anyone.",0

I would've liked a higher valuation for the phone as it is worth more but i just wanted it sold. Great Service. Only cons are didn't receive payment on same day but it was only a day late. Also the valuation isn't as high as i liked. However overall very good experience. Thanks.",1

What could be simpler than ordering, delivery, set up & old appliance recycling!
Ordered a fridge freezer in store for delivery with old appliance pick up (all paid for)
Day 1 - Sat 21st. Phonecall on Saturday despite me informing them the road was narrow they couldn't deliver as the 7 ton lorry couldn't access road. Re-arranged delivery for Sunday on smaller lorry
Day 2 - Sun 22nd - delivery time slot came and went, rang help line delivery was suspended as still on 7 ton lorry re-arranged delivery on Mon 23rd. An hour later knowhow lorry outside house (the same one that couldn't fit down road). They didn't have address details dumped fridge-freezer in dining room without unpacking or taking old one. Rang helpline. Re-arranged pick up for of old one and installing new one Mon 23rd
Day 3 - Mon 23rd - no sign of pick up, rang helpline. all drivers now finished re arranged for Tues 24th
Day 4 - Tues 24th - had someone wait in from 12.30 till 6pm no sign. rang call centre apparently the pick up was complete. (fridge-freezer still sitting in my dining room!) apparently the drivers had picked up a random washing machine!!! thought that was it. I am losing my mind at this point - re -arranged for Weds 25th
Day 5 Weds 25th Sept - lorry to big for road delivery suspended will re-log when driver returns to depot. (I had to ring them again)
Day 6 - Thurs 26th Sept - I had to ring helpline. They have no details of rebooking next available date for pickup and installation. SUNDAY 29TH Sept!

"Infuriated by the incompetence of this company, and at this point it feels like they‚Äôve just taken my money and done a runner.

The TV I ordered was faulty so I sent it in for repair. It was returned to me and upon opening it I noticed that the screen had been smashed in transit by the delivery team. This was back at the start of April and since then I have tried calling over 15 times, sometimes even being on hold for 2 hours. Even when I do make it through I don‚Äôt get any answers or I get cut off and no one even bothers to call back. My number is on file, I‚Äôve given it enough times.

I have been promised a voucher too so that I can get a replacement TV but this never materialises, no matter how many times I call up. No one can give me a straight answer. I have sent multiple enquiries and complaints by email and have heard nothing. I understand timings may be longer in the current climate but over a month to replace a TV that your delivery driver broke is unacceptable.

Would encourage anyone thinking of buying from this company to stay away, they are thieves",0

"ordered a monitor and air duster. DPD failed to deliver my monitor, was told by Ebuyer it was up the road at a collect point (despite home delivery) i went up there and wasnt there. i wasted hours on the phone trying to solve this, in the end they offered a refund or to send another one. i asked for refund as they had wasted huge amounts of time. they then said id have to return the air duster (¬£2 and wouldnt have bought it solo). they couldnt right this off as a loss due to their poor service, no they want me to waste more of my time returning the air duster. Useless shop elsewhere (Monday)

Update (Thursday): after writing my review here i was asked to contact the resolutions departmant (clearly they care more about bad reviews than customer satisfaction). I was offered compensation and free postage but unfortunately because of Ebuyers organisation system the employee I was in contact with have to get approval or check with the senior manager before anything got done. This led to a delay in credit being approved and in the meantime, i have found a much better offer on laptopsdirect.co.uk for ¬£40 cheaper.

Overall disappointed with Ebuyer, unlikely to shop here again. My justified complaints were not taken seriously until i wrote a bad review. Their staff are slowed down by managers which means staff take hours to get approval. The problems started on Monday and Ebuyer where only able to half resolve my complaints by thursday.

"Previously reviewed these in July - and can only say THEY STILL HAVEN'T RESOLVED ANYTHING - in fact, they've made it worse and the revolting little yob they've put in charge of the case ignores me for weeks on end and then gets evasive and abusive. They eventually admitted that they'd messed-up the account so they opened a new one - for THE WRONG PRODUCT. That resulted in me locked-out of settings for the router, on top of the account settings that I still can't access. They are now trying to rip me off over the gift card inducement I still haven't received,

I've tried and I've given the bullying little git every opportunity. Am now passing this on to the regulator.

Best advice - STAY AWAY FROM THIS AWFUL COMPANY AND ITS VILE STAFF

EDIT - I didn't ask you to ""intervene"", I left this review to warn people to stay away from your sick company - but the fact that you have an ""intervention"" process in place tells us that your complaint's system is a sham and is being used to bully and abuse customers, (I also said that I am ""now passing this on"" - I didn't say that I had done so at the time of writing. Another example of you using scripted responses and dialogue boxes instead of actually trying to help the customer. I gave you the account number - until you are officially told by the regulator that they are involved, you have no right to refuse to provide support.)",0

Just visited.. poor effort made I had to approach the staff member and when I did I didnt really get greeted. Told him my issue and what I had done to try and resolve my issue though what I have found online. He then took my phone still without actually speaking to me. He tried plugging my phone in ( I have water damage issue) he said well the red light has cone on so I told him that was the iris decter light not the charging one (should that me my place to say that). Another member of staff then came in more approachable and tried to help. Outcome is me travelling 20miles from where a live to another store or they could send my phone away. No mention of how long it would take no mention of a replacement phone. So am I meant to just go without a phone?? Poor effort made once my contract runs out I will not be returning. In the meantime I'll just stick with wireless charging!! Poor,0

"I went to Carphone Warehouse in Cheshire Oaks today with the intention of buying a pay as you go phone. I already have a sim card with o2. The unlocked sim free phone I wanted was ¬£139, I was going to purchase this package but then noticed that the same phone with a pay as you go with sim was ¬£109 so seeing as I already have an o2 sim card I said to the assistant that I would just do that, get it with an o2 sim and switch mine in after I'd bought it. The assistant would not let me do this and was insistent that if I was going to buy the phone I would have to pay the ¬£139 as I had told him I was not going to use the new sim card. At first I thought he was joking as it makes no difference to them what I do with the phone after I've bought it and it makes no difference to o2 either but he wouldn't budge. So basically if I had just not said what I was going to do with it he would have sold me the phone at the lower price. This is the most ridiculous sales technique I've ever come across in my life, I didn't buy the phone and left speechless, it genuinely felt like I was in a Monty Python sketch or something. Carphone Warehouse must rely on people being stupid to make money, anyway it did me a favour really as I found the same model for ¬£100 on the net but they missed out on a sale through pure stupidity and bloody mindedness, I like to try and support shops by going in in person but would definitely never use this place again.",0

Bought now tv hub 2 (broadband) in March the router was delivered but we couldn‚Äôt activate it till 20th April which I didn‚Äôt mind as I‚Äôd not moved in my house yet. The internet didn‚Äôt go live on the 20th and only because we rang up did we find out why. There‚Äôs an issue that open reach need to deal with however they still haven‚Äôt. I‚Äôve taken many days taken off work unpaid due to the different dates they keep giving me about an engineer coming and still no one has been and we still have no internet.,0

Pc arrived very well packaged.

Took 2 hour to cancel my contract and only option is via the phone. The operator refused to do it and kept putting me on hold and asking the same questions such as which service provider I was going with. Eventually I refused to keep answering and kept repeating I want to cancel but they would not listen. Appauling system and unecessary waste of my (and their) time. Would never use a virgin product again.,0

"The best thing ever has happened, our street only had virgin media cable, open reach has just come down & put new cable in. We have now left virgin media at last. For 17 years we have had intermittent service, the router doesn't reach the whole property even with their booster, fyi it's a bungalow. Most evenings we lost internet for around an hour & more often when we had service it wasn't enough to watch Netflix, I ended up getting unlimited data on my phone & hotspotting, 4g ran our devices better than virgin media cable. As for the customer service well they never sorted the issue over a 17yr period so that speaks for itself. Avoid this company",0
"I ordered my desktop PC on the 21st November, well before the 4th of December deadline at getting my computer WELL before Christmas day.

Let me just mention PC spec go by working days only, mon-friday....keep that in mind...because they secretly don't.

So going back 21st November I made my PC order on finance with Hitachi Capital (UK) it says on the pc spec site it takes around 48 hours to see if my application for credit was successful...
It took a week, was told my application was successful on a SUNDAY.

My order status then went into processing for about 3 day's usual time is 1-6 working days(mon-fri) so was happy about that, the only time I may add.

My order status was in pre-production normal time 1 week as mentioned on their site table, I was told it would take 16 working days for pre-production to finish, it took 19 working days weekends not included in that.

It then went into built mode and then testing in the same day

I received a call from a PC spec employee on a Saturday.....a non working day. Was a problem with a part I picked, I changed it and asked when will my order be ready for delivery as I need to take the day off work unpaid, the employer said Wednesday I would have it.

So on monday my order went to waiting dispatch by this time its 21 working days.
On Tuesday I called PC spec up and asked for definite if I was getting it Wednesday, because  I would have to ask for that day off unpaid to be in for it. I was told YES Wednesday I would have it.....
Tuesday night at 7 it is sill waiting dispatch, I call them was told no it won't be with me Wednesday(tomorrow) will be with me Thursday NOW
I was not happy at all, not only missing out on a days pay.. but now I'm not gonna be in for item to arrive on Thursday. An employer on live chat called Jakob said he starts work at 11:30 he would contact me on Wednesday by email to let me know if it's going out, that was nice of him to do that....but he never did that.

So I called on Wednesday my pointless unpaid day off to make sure it's still coming Thursday, as I would have to arrange someone I trust to wait for it.
They have no idea it will be most likely sent on Thursday, I replied with 'but then it will get delivered on Christmas eve!'
I ain't going to ask someone to stay round mine on Christmas eve.

So now I'm at a complete loss, stressed and wish I went with overclockers or someone else.

Not only does this company not know its a$$ from their elbows by lying to me with false information, I'm having to work my life around and arrange things for something that ain't happening.
I got a soundbar from China and a monitor from America within the time its took PC specs to even get me out of pre-production and they are based at Wakefield less than 2 hours away from me...I could cry if it wasn't so ridiculous.
Phone them 5 mins wait time in queue...then 4....5.....2.....5......2.....4....
17 mins later ya still waiting
Even that has no idea what's going on.

All I get in response is 'this time of year we get a lot of order's' then get more couriers to help with them order's.

I feel sorry for the people who ordered after me, when they getting theirs Christmas day?
I just can't wait for all this stress to be over with to be honest. knowing my luck so far my PC will have a defect and I'm gonna have to send it back, save me from stress send it back and get a refund.",0

Wow... When is trust pilot going to introduce negative star as an option?",0
Can‚Äôt get an engineer to fix unstable internet in the house. Been 3 weeks and BT are hopeless. They subcontract engineer service to QubeGB ltd. They have cancelled two appointments last minute on the same day. They have now offered me another in 5 days. The BT seniors directors should all be fired. Qube GB are making huge profits whilst delivering awful service. The BT board needs to be accountable. They have a supplier failing to deliver service yet this supplier is making huge profits. Check their accounts out !,0
"Sent in a Samsung S20+ as part of a trade in and was quoted ¬£224. After over a week of hearing nothing I‚Äôm given a follow up email that the phone has been deemed ‚Äúnot working‚Äù due to screen burn and was REDUCED TO ¬£85. I personally have looked after this phone like it was made of diamonds. Original protective plastic was still attached when I sent it in and have a plethora of photos confirming the condition of the device.

I am yet to receive my device back as of this review and I expect to have to go Karen-mode on them for a second time to have it returned.

Avoid like the plague, genuinely criminal practices taking place.


Update:
Ignore the response I have received to this reply. The support channels lied to me 3 times about receiving tracking numbers for the return postage. I will update this review once the device has returned and I can inspect it.",0

"I'd think very carefully about switching to Vodafone Broadband as a new customer.

I switched from Virgin because Voda was offering a very good price on their gigafast pro package.

The initial purchase process was really smooth - engineer booked and received the new kit a few days before the appointment.

Unfortunately, the engineers (CityFibre) didn't turn up. Rescheduled the appt to the following week. They turned up to this appointment - however, the 2 vans sat outside my house for 45 mins and then phoned me to say something had come up before driving off.

OK...

So rescheduled again for the following week... engineers turned up, but said there was an issue with the pole and that they couldn't complete the job as would need a cherry picker and trained hoist... person. V apologetic and guaranteed all the right team (cherry picker and hoist person inc.) would be with me in a few days, taking me to yesterday, Friday 6/10

The team didn't arrive in the morning slot so I spoke with Vodafone's 'EasySwitch' (lol) team who confirmed the job was penned in and that they would definitely be there by 6pm. Alas...

So, called today after that no-show to be told that CityFibre was closed and that the next appt is not available until Weds. That would be the 5th appointment with absolutely zero guarantees it would actually happen and I'd actually be connected.

Unfortunately, at this point, I had to ask the team to cancel my order and I have just reordered Virgin, albeit for more ¬£ and less Mpbs. I also switched from Voxi (part of Vodafone) to o2 as part of that package so Vodafone has now completely lost a long-time customer.

I can't really imagine those who run the customer experience team and who are in charge of new customer acquisitions at Vodafone would be particularly happy with this insane flaw in their process... Appreciate CityFibre is a third party, but surely before selling a package to a new customer there should be a level of confidence that the service can actually be provided.

We have a street WhatsApp (I know, very cool right) and of course I'll suggest anyone else thinking of using Voda through CityFibre just don't.

I've raised a complaint so let's see, would be nice to be compensated for the 3 weeks without internet, not to mention the stress of trying to work from home with patchy 4G (eating into both mine and my partners allowance) and of not being able to use any of our connected devices, and of waiting around on 4 occasions for nothing to happen.

Hope this is helpful to anyone considering the switch - I see they have pretty terrible reviews overall, I would absolutely take that as a sign.",0

"Tried to purchase a ¬£300 item, paid for the item but it took me back to the payment page following the money being taken from my account. No order was placed - but I have still paid.

Contacted 2 different members at Argos who said they can't do anything and I have to wait a week to get my money back. I now have no money AND no item despite a promise of getting the item today in time for christmas next week.

3 times this has happened with Argos.",0
"Ordered a freeview box online, 4 days later received an email saying there had been a ""glitch"" (whatever that means) on their website and they had cancelled my order and would refund me. Checked on their website and the item was still available to buy. On the no reply email they sent there was a number to call for help.

On calling I was given 5 options, then another 5 options, each time I was given a further 5 options, in all 25 options. Now the best bit on pressing the last option I was given their website address to track my item and then a thank you and I was cut off.

They have no contactable email address. Later in the week I visited the Grantham store and spoke to a staff member explaining the problem, they didn't know why (helpful) on checking stock the staff member said he had two in stock and had no idea why my order was cancelled.

I bought the same item at the same price at Argos ordered online in the evening and collected next morning.

Curry's wonder why their sales are down, probable the way you treat customers. By the way this isn't the first time this has happened to me. But it will be the last.",0

"Made an order for delivery through their app, estimated time was about an hour and half, which I didn't mind when I ordered.
Once the time arrived, I received a message from the driver on the app stating he was outside, he wasn't. I immediately replied, and asked if he needed direction, he replied yes. So I gave him directions, he then asks me to leave my door wide open and lights on (it was dark out) which I didn't want to have to do as it was very cold out, and didn't want to let the heat out... But obliged.
So waited 10 minutes, still no sign I then asked him to call me...Of which he then suddenly closed the chat and the app stated my food had been delivered.
I was left confused thinking he might be round the corner, but nope it didn't arrive.

It was now 7.25pm, my 2 kids who had school the next day hadn't eaten dinner yet and were tired.
I contacted deliveroo who didn't care about any of the inconvenience caused and what the driver did.
Told me I wouldn't be charge, but offered nothing in credit for the inconvenience.

I then emailed them back and fourth and got text book responses with not an actually reply. Eventually got offered ¬£2.50 which I'm not using.

I've now deleted the app and will never be using them again. If something goes wrong on their part that is causing significant inconvenience to a customer they should at least compensate with a reasonable amount! Would actually make me think they cared about my custom and would order again in the future.",0

"This is the worst service I have ever experienced. Our internet was meant to be switched on on the 17th December, BT made a mistake and put us in the wrong area and so the engineer was not able to do so, they said this would be a 5 minute job if we rang back BT, we did, we got another appointment 2 whole weeks later (which is ridiculous) with an engineer who was meant to come 1-6 and my partner took a day off work and he never bothered showing up!! Now BT are saying it will not be done until 3rd feb earliest when it was their mistake. Absolute joke and completely useless. Have not been able to live in my flat as I have to work from home and have no internet so have to stay an hour away at my parents so I can work. Utterly inexcusable - if you‚Äôre looking to use BT please do be aware your internet will most likely not be on until 2 months later.",0
"Absolutely appalling. Worst costumer service imaginable... Beyond a joke in every possible sense. Too many things have happened in the years we have been with them to even list here... everything from overcharging us, not updating our details properly on their system, losing service all together, switch from home to business broadband not happening for 6 months, saying they've sent out engineers when they haven't, closing cases without even looking into them and hanging up on us on the phone. There is virtually no way to communicate unless it's them calling to threaten you about a service you don't have. Perhaps the most ridiculous is them trying to reach us on the landline that doesn't work (which they were meant to fix) and accusing us of ignoring their calls. Would actually be funny if it wasn't offensive. Stay clear from them. Moved to talk talk and finally free from this clown company.",0

"Firstly, it‚Äôs important to say that I‚Äôve been a happy VM customer for two years. However, due to the most stressful customer experience I‚Äôve had for a long time, I would strongly advise EVERYONE to avoid VM. It‚Äôs all fine when things are working, but after spending over 3 hours on the phone to 7 different agents, my stress levels are off the chart.

Problems started yesterday, Friday, when my WiFi and all devices connected (wifi and wired) were intermittent at best. Spent over an hour on the phone with a technician who was resetting, rebooting, doing all that stuff remotely. No real change for the rest of Friday. I had hoped it may have just been a glitch and it would all be fine today. Sadly not. Over two hours with different technicians, customer retentions, being cut off the line twice, being offered an engineer visit on Friday, a week after the problems began, plus the fact I work from home and need the internet working, my stress, anxiety and anger levels are indescribable.

No help at all from any of the VM team. No taking into account that I cannot work for a week. They did offer an earlier engineer appointment on Tuesday but I would have to pay ¬£25 for that engineer and then claim it back, why? It‚Äôs hardly my fault that your service isn‚Äôt working. They also stated I could claim ¬£8 back for the days it‚Äôs not been working, that‚Äôs going to cover my loss of earnings isn‚Äôt it.

It‚Äôs clearly the router hub that‚Äôs the issue. They refused to send a replacement, ‚Äòan engineer needs to visit first and say we need a new hub.‚Äô Initially customer retentions agreed that I could disconnect immediately to move to another company, after a short disagreement when they tried to charge me over ¬£200 for leaving early! They then had to transfer me back to a technician for a ‚Äònotation‚Äô before disconnecting. Then I got transferred back to a different person in customer retentions who flatly refused and said I‚Äôd been misled by ‚ÄòTanya‚Äô and that I couldn‚Äôt leave without paying the exit fee.

Clearly I‚Äôm absolutely livid at VM, they don‚Äôt have a clue what they‚Äôre doing. One person says one thing and another says something else. No regard for the fact that I have no idea how I‚Äôm going to work this week. The one glimmer of light is that VM are likely to increase their prices imminently which will allow me to leave this god awful company before my end date of April 24 without having to pay a fee.

My advice, they are cheap for a reason, their service is terrible. Please avoid VM and pay a little bit more for better service and peace of mind that the issues will be solved if something goes wrong!!",0

"Upon ordering an American style fridge for our townhouse, we were asked by sales staff how many stairs were involved in the delivery, which we answered correctly of 13. We also paid for installation, and door removing service as well. Sale went through, and delivery was confirmed for the following Saturday. Upon delivery, the 2 delivery drivers took one look at the stairs and immediately refused to carry fridge upstairs and install, stating health and safety would not let them, and stated that this happens all the time!! The fridge was unpacked and left in our hallway, blocking our access to our living room and garden! After drivers left, we went straight back to the store to complain. Original sales staff member, knew nothing about the stairs issues upon deliveries within the company, and the manager was less than helpful, stating he could get another team of delivery men out to us, but they might say the same thing, as it was their decision to do so, or not???? No other option was given to us, but he could understand our predicament!! We were left to move a 130kg fridge upstairs, between my girlfriend and me, and her 2 children!",0

"I would have given Vodafone no stars if I could! My iPhone 12 broke last Wednesday. It decided when I tried to unlock it to only recognise me pressing keys 7,8,9 and 0 and unfortunately my passcode has other numbers in it so I couldn't unlock my phone. I hadn't dropped it. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me that Apple only gives a one year warranty but Vodafone gives a warranty for the second year if you have a iPhone with them on contract. So I went to my local Vodafone store.

Here's where the problems started. Unlike Apple they don't repair on site. And unlike Apple since COVID hit they don't provide courtesy phones whilst a phone is sent away for repair. They claim it can take up to 10 days to repair a phone. So they expect you to wait this long with no phone. You would think Vodafone would realise that nowadays your whole life is on your phone. I can't do so many day to day activities without my smart phone. Oh and the person in the store tried to claim that the government has banned them from issuing courtesy phones because of COVID. But if that is the case then how can Apple provide courtesy phones?

Avoid this company. It is great when nothing goes wrong but as soon as it does they are totally useless!!!!",0

Seriously after previously waiting longer than advised , I have asked for a manager to contact me as yet no response to this request, more than happy to provide transcripts of conversation and give my name . After using ghd faithfully last 10 years is extremely poor customer service",0

When I cancelled my membership, it wasn‚Äôt clear I had to cancel the Boost feature (free trial I hadn‚Äôt asked for) separately. Why I would want / use Boost having cancelled my membership is bizarre. I don‚Äôt plan on going anywhere near this company again, especially with so many other streaming services out there.",0
"Food did not arrive. After ordering food the kitchen cooked it and was then picked up by the delivery driver who must have gone approx. 200m and switched their phone off and taken my food home.

Customer service would admit that the food was picked up by the rider and that the rider lost tracking not far from the resturant.

I was expecting an immediate full refund from deliveroo as many hours had past and no food had arrived. Instead, this was not the case. 3 weeks down the line still having a back and forth over the refund. I cannot describe how infuriating this experience has been.

Anyone reading this. Please save yourself the trouble and avoid.

I will caveat that I have used deliveroo in the past before and its been fine. However in the past 2 years its been astoundingly bad and is plagued with issues.

Wish I could give less than 1*. And suprised this business can still operate bu charging people without a proper service.",0

"I ordered an iPhone 14 Pro, on an 02 24 month contract. The phone arrived in good time, however the sim did not work in the phone. I was advised to wait and I did so for 4 days. On investigating with 02 they advised the sim/contract had been set up incorrectly by this company or that they failed to include the right information. This meant the SIM card provided, and indeed any SIM card on that network would never work on the phone. This company confirmed what 02 had said, and that there had been a technical mistake/error on their end and advised me they would have to cancel the order/contract and I would need to return the phone to them. This has been inconvenient as I‚Äôve had to wipe the phone to factory settings, repackage it, pay for special delivery and return it to them, and now I have to wait for it to be cancelled and be refunded which based on the timeline provided could be a couple of weeks. I‚Äôve also been advised that I cannot take another contract out while my current one is being cancelled. This has all left me without a phone for over a week, and having returned it today will likely be a few more weeks until I‚Äôm able to get a new one. On this basis I have to rate my experience as one star. No compensation or apology has been offered despite their admitted mistake and error for causing this problem.",0

"Virgin Media are so terrible when it comes to complaints! I raised a complaint in March and then I managed to speak with someone which helped and now I had another issue for 6 weeks and when I raised a complaint this time, there was no human to speak to, all done via email which was terrible, slow replies, they don't read the notes or complaint just give generic response.

My issue went on for 6 weeks, affected me in a massive way, long delays, intermittent connection and then loss of service for a little bit. I raised it with independent complaints for help and virgin responded via their legal team, seems like they got too many complaints and removed the human talk and now you get legal involved. Legal provided a strong case, I'm not a lawyer so I couldn't provide details on that level and so I lost. Got nothing for the 6 weeks of broadband issues, terrible! If you raise a complaint with virgin media, all I will say is good luck!",0

"From the outset it was a waste of money. Joined to watch a specific series. Signed up and they took 2 payments from me. Thought I was signing up to one payment plan - entertainment. End up getting charged for Boost too. No idea what that was but assumed it was something I missed. Anyway 2 plans paid for and streaming wouldn‚Äôt work. Ended up on a live chat with someone who just couldn‚Äôt sort the streaming problem. Saturday night wasted. Steaming miraculous started working 2 days later. Watched my series then cancelled my membership. BUT HERES THE CON! I didn‚Äôt have one membership no I had 3 (unbeknownst to me). Entertainment, cinema and boost. They continued to take payments out of my account and the only way to stop it was to call my bank and cancel my card. When I contacted NOW TV nonsense customer service I get told that instead of refunding me they will ‚Äúcredit my account‚Äù - right with my money! Eh no how about refunding me as I‚Äôm not using any of your services. I‚Äôm still receiving emails asking for payment for the 2 accounts I haven‚Äôt cancelled (or used). Terrible company. Avoid!",0
"A basic and clunky tv player compared to rivals. The TV guide bears little resemblance to what is actually shown and when there are schedule changes, eg when sporting events are delayed, the tv guide is not updated. They do not care if they spoil the result of a sports event for fans trying to catch up with a scheduled replay. Instead of watching a scheduled replay of the Japanese GP I have been watching 1.5 hours of reaction and analysis. It seems pretty stupid to schedule a replay at this time when they know there is a good chance of the race being delayed. Also, why not have reaction on one channel and the replay on one of there other many many channels? Or at least put a banner up to tell the viewer when the actual replay will happen. Other providers are way ahead of Sky Sports in this regard.",0

"Reviewed two products, neither review absurdly negative or over the top (decidedly not recommendations, either) and they remain unpublished on the WEX website.
This is problematic for a number of reasons - you are invited to do so, so why bother if they won‚Äôt feature? The reviews you DO see are plainly only the positive ones, because WEX is selling those items. This is laughably unbalanced, approaching dishonesty.
If you see an item on their site with only positive
reviews this obviously gives a false impression, if more critical reviews are suppressed.

"Useless customer service. I ordered a Samsung galaxy S22 ultra 512gb in black with unlimited calls, data and texts as part of a 24 month contract with ID mobile on the 12th of November. I was informed when I called yesterday to get an update that the order was cancelled because I had a refund for the same item being processed. Therefore, the credit check failed.

I was also informed that I can only re-order the item on Monday the 28th of November 2022 or 5 days after the refund has been processes. The first order which I placed on the 9th of November, arrived with a damaged box hence the reason why I returned it. The reason why I re-ordered the same item promptly is because the item is discounted as part of a black Friday deal. The item is now now out of stock so I am unable to re-order it. I am very disappointed that I wasn't notified that my order has been cancelled after I placed the order and I had to call up 2 weeks later to find out for myself. The item was available for pre-order so I do not understand why it simply was not put on back order. I also called them twice on 2 different weeks and I was promised a call back.

Then when we went into the store we found the monthly contract ended 2 months earlier than we thought and was told that the additional money we paid was lost. We have other phones with other network providers - tesco and they automatically reduce your payments when the contract has ended.

I agreed to have the receipt emailed to me but it has not arrived. I have tried to phone both the Carphone warehouse and Currys at New Malden but both times after waiting for 5 minutes and them telling me my call was important they cut the call and told me to phone back.

This was unusual for me to visit a store rather than buy online. After having this type of service I will not shop there again and I recommend that unless you need it today and are willing for to put with bad service no one else does either.

"Today 30/12/2022

I was moving house late Sep - early Oct. Trying to call early Oct to cancel the contract but not possible to connect with anyone even the live chat or calling 0345 454 1111 (Can't contact with virgin since early Oct until today, even today calling 3 times but all disconnected).

Decided to call sale team and immediately connected on 30/12/2022.

The lady was transferring me to lots of different team (Sale Team then Detention Team then Collection Team Then Movers Team). Not sure all the team's name are correct but on the phone for over 1 hour.

The guy on the collection team told me that my account was ¬£115 and he reduced to ¬£50. If I pay ¬£50 to clear the balance then he will help me to close my account (He will do it, not transfer it to another team). I decided to pay to get less stresses. After I paid, he suddenly transferring me to different team which is Movers as I think then the line just disconnected. The guy on the collection team was lying to me just to get the money and leave me alone.

I tried to call back the customer service number and amazingly the line is open and straightaway I connected with Movers Team. The guy on Movers Team was helpful but cannot help me to close my account due to some system issues. He advise me to call back later when the account is back on.

I'm not sure that when I call back, they can sort it out or not but virgin customer services is truly lowest quality services ever.

Be aware when sign a contract with them as it will be really difficult to cancel. The website does not have any clear guide for you to cancel. The live chat never get connected, the customer service number almost disconnected all the time.",0

"Used to be with Virgin and changed due to shocking service. Changed to BT and started off positively but on two separate occasions in the last 6 months we've been without internet service, this time for a whole month. Cube came out last week, changed socket on the wall, it started to work. The minute the guy left, we lost connection again. BT said they would send Open Reach to us today to invedtigate further but the cube arrived again! Poor guy was very apologetic (not his fault when the wrong service was booked). We called customer service again, told us they can't send anyone to us until next Tuesday 6/9 now. This means rearranging work schedules AGAIN and losing pay. Absolutely sick to death of this shoddy service....is there any internet company that can cope?",0

I asked on chat what was going on and was told that dpd recycle numbers. I got an email 20 mins later that it will be delivered on Monday! That is no use as i travel alot. To top it off they told my provider that it was a sim swap so i have no working sim!!!!,0
Consistent updates showing me the progress of my order. excellent setup instructions and protective packaging. worked flawlessly upon setup.,1
My item did not arrive and no attempt to deliver. ebuyer would not refund until the delivery company had returned item to warehouse and expected me to pay for a replacement rather than immediately sending one out,0
"Simple and effective process, took about as long as I expected and it was enjoyable. Had no issues with the order when it arrived, all worked well out of the box.",1
Have a laptop with a hardware fault. Drop it for repair. And only thing that service did reinstall windows and update bios. Second time same s**t. Laptop was bought less when half year ago. So question why i should pay money for insurance if team knowhow can't fix it right???,0

"AVOID! HORRIFIC Customer service (probably worst I've ever experienced).

Tried lodging a complaint 5 times, spending over 6 hours on call - agents hung up on me each time and never called me back (even after confirming a callback time)

I've never experienced such abysmal customer service, none of the issues I raised were dealt with - they are actively gatekeeping their complaints department.

Worst provider, worst attitude towards customers and an overall catastrophe if needed for any reason. They're only interested in taking your money.",0
"Very disappointing that they couldn't repair my oven despite them emailing me to say ""Good news, your repair is complete"". In fact, they cancelled my policy because the cost of parts made it uneconomical to repair but they didn't inform me about this - I had to find it out for myself. To be fair, they have refunded me and their decision is in line with Ts and CS but I do feel like I've been left high and dry. I'm now back to sourcing another repair company...",0
"Appalling service, I ordered a phone for my son who lives in Clacton, over a 100 miles from where I live, to be collected in store by him. After placing the order I received a text saying the card used to purchase had to be presented, this was not spelt out in the terms and conditions, despite their claim it is. I telephoned the store in Clacton and was met with not just an unhelpful manager but an extremely rude manager. When I said I wanted to cancel, he said to contact customer service. I phoned customer service, the message said open seven days a week, but when you get through their automated system to the final option, it said closed, only open Monday to Friday. I phoned on Monday, got through to South Africa to a pleasant enough lady but such a strong accent, difficult to understand, she said I have to contact the store to cancel as it has already been delivered there. I phoned the store back and was met with another assistant who seemed so disinterested in anything, he said the payment won't be taken until you collect it (which we obviously can't). Now I see it has been taken off my credit card, so phoned customer service back, she said it will be refunded to the card in 14 days. I have written to complain about the absolute rudeness of the store manager at Clacton, among the things he said were that I obviously don‚Äôt read the terms and conditions like most customers, he kept interrupting me, when asked not to interrupt he said No and kept misquoting me and when I told him I was going to complain he said ‚Äúyou obviously have too much time on your hands‚Äù My advice, don't go anywhere near Carphone Warehouse or Currys PC World, all tarnished with the same brush",0

Cheers and respect but not to Nowtv, they are owned by sky and depending when you call them, they give different answers. Their website is unusable and it really is quite pathetic a company should operate this shameful way in the year 2020.",0

"UPDATE:
I sent the laptop back for repairs. It was gone for two weeks and the problems are now even worse than before.

Rather than fixing the problem I had with my NVIDIA Graphics card, they have straight up uninstalled my Intel GPU. The laptop no longer has acces to it.

On top of this they have also locked my D: drive, which I now no longer have access to. I cannot believe how TERRIBLE this company is and I will tell everyone I know. By now I've heard from loads of people online they have had so much trouble with PC Specialist.

I also work in a technical field, and PC Specialist can be assured I have told everyone and I will keep telling everyone. I've also heard from multiple colleagues they've had similar experience. WORST WORST WORST experience ever, AVOID AT ALL COST!

There has only been one person at the company who has at least kept me informed and helped me sort things out. He has been friendly, but he can obviously only do what his manager approves as well.

ORIGINAL:
I was hesitant to buy a laptop from PC Specialist as I knew two of my friends have had trouble with their laptops in the past. Despite this, I ordered a new laptop for my job from PC Specialist. However, from the very first use, I got graphical crashes. Whenever I have Chrome open, attend Zoom meetings etc. The laptop screen freezes and only displays distorted images of what should be on screen. The laptop just does not seem to use the Nvidia graphics card, but only the internal Intel one.

I contacted PC Specialist within about two weeks to notify them of this issue. I monitored various things, but it is very disruptive for my work. After contacting them several times by email I decided to call in the hope someone would take me serious. At that point the laptop was still less than a month old. The customer service member at that point told me he would look into the possibility to replace the laptop altogether, because it was so broken within a month and I just can't use it.

It has been a month since then and I am still stuck with a broken laptop. Now they want me to send it back so they can inspect and potentially repair it, which means I will not have it for 3-4 weeks and I will miss my income for this time. This is also no guarantee that it will work upon return to me.

While all of this has been going on I've heard from more friends and colleagues that they have also had trouble with laptops from PC Specialist.

I strongly advise anyone who is looking for a reliable laptop to not buy from PC Specialist. I even paid extra for insurance and cover, none of which seems to make any difference now, what a scam. Laptop came in broken, customer service does not take the issue serious and overall a very expensive mistake.",0

"Signed up to their broadband deal as best value in the market and swapped to their router on the first day of the contract. I got a couple of texts telling me the order was delayed which I thought were scams as the only previous method of communication were emails.
Then my old provider charged me twice my normal fee! Turns out I was still with them (the NowTV router works with my old provider) and they had charged me the out of contract fee!
NowTV had failed to fulfil the order but not clearly communicated that. They eventually cancelled the order as my connection wasn't right apparently and because they cancelled the order I'm not due any compensation! Going through complaints process but they take 2 weeks to reply after me chasing rather than the 72 hours they state.",0

"This matter has now been going on for 12 weeks neither IDMOBILE or curry carphone warehouse want to accept responsibility, this is my second review , both company's will reply to this to say sorry to here about this blah blah blah contact us , and they do nothing!

I have proof a phone the shipped out that was supposed to be returned to me has be shipped to a different address because 1. the picture I have from dpd shows another house
2. The lady at dpd said my address wasn't the address it was shipped to , but was unable to confirm what address it went to.
3. The house it was delivered to has a red door mine is black
4. It was handed to a white lady and everyone at my adress is brown

So 3 months in , 10 days before Christmas I am a phone or money down ,money that I was relying on for Christmas,

Spoke to and emailed voth companies asked for mangers to call back said I would hear back in 48 hours, I was told this by 3 different and nothing

Thank-you for ruining Christmas

Absolutely appalling service

As I thought after this negative review I get an email. But still not the phone call I was promised , I have asked for all this information previously but no recieved anything , these replies are not worth the your time sending them because they are thoughtless meaningless you passing the buck , no matter what tou say I am missing a phone 7 days before Christmas hope you are happy tou have spoilt my christmas",0
"Appalling customer service department. I've never been so blatantly lied to on so many occasions. I've been trying to get my husbands phone unblocked for 5 days now. Everytime I call, they say 24 hours and it will be done. The time I call, they say 2 to 3 hours. Then I phone again and they say impossible to unblock in 2-3 hours. Then I phone again and we are back to 24hrs. Waiting to day for a call back from a manager, which is unlikely to happen. This is a buisness phone and Vodafone are ruining our buisness and this is not the first time. They lost the nbuisness number previously. We are a small buisness struggling with the cope. I've even emailed the CEO we are that desperate. PLEASE DON'T USE VODAFONE!!!",0

Her experience is horrendous. She had to explain in blunt terms that her husband has died, was dead. The call handler insisted on speaking to him and did not understand. They even said please call back when you are with your husband!! Shame on you carphone warehouse. Cruel at best. My friend is distraught by this experience.",0

Mark's electrical didnt have the item in stock but as soon as they did it was delivered the next day. From ordering to delivery took less than 6 days. The delivery was on time as stated, updated regularly when the driver was close by. The delivery guys were super efficient and a pleasure to deal with. From ordering to receiving the item Mark's electrical have been flawless. I would definitely use them again and recommend them to anyone.",1

Good price nice packaging prompt despatch only let down by bad service of royal mail,1
Website would not let me keep talktalk phone number so was forced to select 'get new number'. Signed contract etc and cancelled my existing broadband.... only to find out some weeks later that Vodafone had unilaterally cancelled the contract - supposedly because I had selected 'keep my number'!

"Over the years, as I became more lazy and lethargic, I chose not to build my own PC's, or should I say - PC's for those needing them.

In the last 6 months, I have had 4 PC's from PC Specialist. 3 for kids getting into PC gaming, and 1 for the wife to replace her aging Chillblast unit.

The online configurator is ridiculously simple to use and it made the configuration section fast and easy from the off.

The ""bang per buck"" value is damn good, considering your PC is being built and tested fully for you. Xmas was particularly busy for them, yet they still got 3 full PC's built, tested and ready to ship in time (All thanks to the legend that is Jack Turner).

I actually popped from Grimsby to just past Wakefield to pick them up too, so collections are possible if you prefer (really easy to find, too).

I did compare the prices versus other companies, and PC Specialist came out on top each time.

Keep it up folks, you're on to a winner :)",1

Scummy company who don't care if someone is using your bank details. Have asked them to remove any trace of my card and personal details but still the money is taken every month. Shocking customer service. REPLY TO MY BANK AND STOP TAKING MY MONEY.,0

Currys sell shoddy products and then try to get customers to pay a monthly fee for a 'whatever happens' plan, they don't cover for whatever happens, also this insurance is economically unviable as the monthly installments add up to more than the cost of the product. What a rip off. Why would I buy into that? Consumer Act states that the product should last a reasonable amount of time so Currys should replace of fix items that don't last. I want a full cash refund, not a Currys voucher for half of the value. Its 13 months old and should last at least 6 years!",0
"On time,quick job,cleared up the mess before leaving. Very happy with the work.",1
"Absolutely brilliant service. They had exactly what I wanted in stock, cheaper than anywhere else and delivery was next day and just a few days before Christmas. This is the only company I'll use for sourcing and purchasing spare replacement parts.",1
The Engineer arrived on time and was really helpful to repair and gave good advice regarding my appliance. He was also professional and coouteous.,1
"Great service. Would recommend and use again.
I didn't get a text message half an hour before delivery but the delivery driver did call me on arrival. As he was 15 minutes earlier than expected, he waited until met him at my house and both him and his colleague were very polite and helpful.",1
"Overall very Happy with my PC.
Encountered a few minor issues. There was only one pcie cable installed into my 3070 which isn't the recommended fitting, however this is as simple as fitting an extra one really easy. The GPU bracket rubber spacers were slightly resting against one of the fans which made a god awful noise when I started up, again really easy fix just moved it slightly. I imagine this happened during transport so just one to check before using your PC.

The customer service was outstanding throughout, always spoke to the same person. Very professional and helpful. Always quick to reply.
Thanks PC specialist I'll definitely be using your services again

Tom",1
Communication is great and the delivery and quality as a whole very good.,1
It was very easy to book my appointment for an engineer to come and investigate my oven's problem. When the engineer arrived he was polite and very knowledgeable. My only complaint is I think that customers should be given either an hour or half an hour's courtesy phone call by the engineer before they arrive.,1
"Best prices out there and very quick delivery, will definitely use again",1
"Poor customer service!
I have been with Vodafone for 2 years. They suggested increasing the fee each April and they did a 20% rise since my original contract.
But when it came to renewing the contract, I negotiated the fee with customer service. One of them cut off the line in the middle of the negotiation. And then, I called again with a long process to reach out in person. I mentioned their offer to new customers, which they offer ¬£25/m and ¬£100 voucher to give away! I asked them to give at least ¬£25/m, instead of the current ¬£27/m. But they offer ¬£33/m for the same service.
This unfair price offer applies to all providers, but at least you can get a reasonable explanation or another offer.
I left them the same day of course!!",0
"failed delivery twice costing me time money and very poor sleep waiting for deliveries

Friday 28th June ‚Äì order the goods in store in person. Washing machine and fridge freezer. Choose Tuesday 2nd July 13.30-17.30 as delivery slot. On night shifts full time, i finish work 8am go morrisons on way home buy lots of fridge food ready for when it arrives. Not freezer food because I think delivery time is too long and it will defrost before the fridge freezer arrives. i pay for daughters' taxi to come over from town and sit and wait until 3pm (im asleep) when she has to go back to town to fetch her kids from school, I get up and take over, pay for daughters taxi back into town sit by window watching and waiting. Keep checking online which says delivery on route. Nothing arrives. Daughter calls in for me as my mobile has internet signal only at the house (no phone signal) and my landline is meant to be for incoming calls only. Informed my daughter that they went to house but nobody answered so they‚Äôve gone, they took a photograph (house with white door and steps, wrong address as mine is brown door no steps and nobody came I was sat at window watching and waiting) informed they wont be out until Saturday next. I call in myself begrudgingly using landline which I didn‚Äôt want to do but so angry I have to wait until Saturday when its their cock up, also they are still out delivering at this time. I'm on night shifts Friday, Saturday Sunday.
I speak to a man- very very apologetic about everything (spending money arranging taxi, fridge food I now have to either throw or give away) he gives me a reference number for the complaint tells me he can put me in for early delivery Saturday (although I don‚Äôt understand why I have to wait that long for mistake to be rectified) as I will be asleep all day, he says I can have 07.00-11.00 slot. I tell him I don‚Äôt leave work until 8am. He puts down for 8.15-11.00 delivery. I give my landline number and tell him to pass on that I get no mobile signal at the house. He gives me reference number for the complaint. He asks me if my house is easy to find as he is unsure why they went to wrong address, I tell him that I only moved in the previous week, when I came to look at it my satnav took me straight to it, sofa I had delivered the day before from Birmingham came straight to the house no problems, Since this conversation my partner from Yorkshire came down, sat nav brought him straight to the door. I don‚Äôt understand why the delivery driver couldn‚Äôt find it. I email customer services to confirm the conversation, confirm that as stated I will be home by 08.15 and to confirm my landline number. I receive an acknowledgement email thanking me.
Friday evening ‚Äì confirmation text about delivery on Saturday, says 15.40-19.40 slot. Customer services closed so I have to wait until I leave work 8am Saturday morning to speak to anyone, lady denies all knowledge of delivery time I was given. I tell her I wont hear anyone come that late that they are now saying I will be asleep upstairs, mobile phone has no signal, house phone downstairs I wont hear, I tell her that I was given that slot specifically because of my working nights and it was a rearranged delivery as it was because they went to wrong address last time. No movement on her part for different delivery slot time. I tell her I will have to sleep downstairs on sofa in that case, I need my washing machine I have no uniform left that is clean to wear for work. I tell her to make sure they ring the doorbell to wake me up. I have an awful sleep on sofa, hardly slept, not comfortable, keep waking up, finally get up 17.30. Delivery not arrived, I go onto live tracker, says im number 23, they are on 18, near Broadway about 5 miles from me. I keep checking tracker, says they are on number 23 which is me. Then it all disappears around 18.30 a message comes up on the tracker site saying they need to speak to me about my delivery, I call the number on the message, closed for the day. I start to panic, I go to bathroom upstairs, voicemail comes through on my mobile ( no phone call on my landline which I said specifically to call) says they will not be delivering as they are running out of time. This is over an hour and half before time slot runs out ! I cant get hold of anyone, stores closed, everything closed at 6pm. I am now extremely tired from having poor sleep on the sofa waiting for the items that yet again did not show up but yet again going to have to stay awake as its sunday and the store doesn't open until 10.00. I have ordered the items from Argos. I AM going to get a full refund today. DISGUSTING",0

Every day it‚Äôs the same story- ‚Äòwe‚Äôve contacted BT Openreach they‚Äôre sending an engineer out- same result no change
We have their latest router( which we paid for) but here we are depending on 4G which is crap in our area

Great service from ordering to delivery. Really helpful and friendly delivery team Ferenc K and Craig D,1
"I had a problem with my broadband, which a few people had tried to solve, with no luck. After multiple phone calls, I had given up on my service (me loosing my Keep Me card didn't help the problem).
I had a phone call from Alan, who started the process to resolve the issue (new router). He kept an eye on my enquiry throughout and made contact with me again when he saw the new router wasn't working. Within 10 minutes, I finally had broadband!",1
"I think the policy of a missed delivery needs to change.

I was stuck in traffic and all I ordered was some beer from a local shop. No attempt at trying to re-deliver.

I can understand a takeaway or something you can‚Äôt exactly return the food for refund etc but some beer from a shop? Come on. That‚Äôs easily returnable and easily refundable to your customers, Deliveroo.",0
"I'm using FFX more and more rather than Screwfix or Toolstation. FFX is generally better value, especially on delivery charges.",1
"Lee and Tommy delivered as requested.
Many thanks.",1
"The follow up on the delivery was great, the customer service is one of the best I have received in a long time.",1
Bought items a few times always excellent all round customer service,1
"I have been without broadband since 13th July and what a fiasco it has been trying to get the problem resolved. It started when two incompetent so called engineers couldn't run a fibre cable to my property due to a blockage. After contacting BT to inform them of the situation and obtain an assurance, verbally and in writing, I wouldn't lose connection, low and behold around an hour after the cowboy engineers left, my service ceased. So here we are, 28th July and STILL no broadband despite numerous calls, failed engineer visits, lies, broken promises and diarised calls not being made. As I write, I'm patiently waiting for a call back from yesterday to resolve the complaint. This was on the back of an hour and a half call to BT only to be hung up on. Absolute joke of an organisation given that communication is their thing but, it's one thing they fail to do.",0
Very fast service. Have all my household appliance insured with D & G.,1
"AVOID! Ended up with over 200 pounds tax back not claimed as the staff gave me the wrong information for (possibly) not having the form in store!
Tried to call them, tried the 0800 and also sent them a letter. No response, terrible customer service!
Never again!",0
Good luck if you ever need to contact them about anything. They sure love to make you wait!,0
"Friendly price, free delivery- nothing to complain",1

Buy all my tvs from richer sounds very happy with there help in choosing the right tv,1
Absolute disgrace.will be asking for a full refund after waiting in all day for a dishwasher to be delivered.

"Not recommended! After having contract with them for 6 years I‚Äôm paying ¬£48 just for internet and it‚Äôs not as fact as it was , when you try to contact them you wait a lot of minutes until you quit",0
"Dire, terrible, uneducated staff who just infuriate you to oblivion.

I‚Äôve been overcharged for a single top up. I was charged double and three have said that I charged up another phone number from my app which only has my number linked to it. Therefore THREE is fraudulently accepting card top ups from your credit card.

I‚Äôve had to after years break from them as they are just a terrible company to deal with and their customer service staff are as thick as a plank.",0
I signed up for 10 month football sports pass with Now Tv to watch my team Man City. Last season I had same pass and was able to watch lots of Man City games. This season BT Sport have nearly all of them so I feel Now Tv is a waste of money to me. VERY disappointed and I do not recommend Now Tv anymore.,0

"When I ordered this it was supposed to have 4 months Spotify free with it Argos we‚Äôre supposed to send me a link to it I have never received this so I won‚Äôt be using Argos again.

Argos sent me a reply and told me to contact them on twitter or face book I have no accounts with either and don‚Äôt wish to start them come on Argos what‚Äôs wrong with e-mail",0
Cheapest price. Next day delivery. Very happy with FFX. Saved a decent amount vs Screwfix and Toolstation.,1
"Worst experience of my life; would have given no stars if I could. Signed up for fibre optic in April and cancelled within the cooling off period as had a better offer from Virgin media. They never cancelled, account was still live, they sent BT to set up fibre optic even though I cancelled, sending me emails and a bill this week for nearly ¬£70 for a service I never used. Spoke to numerous people, some of which didn't know what was going on and some who told me to ignore emails and texts that were sent. I am not paying the bill and cancelled my direct debit. Even emailed a complaint and received an automated reply saying I should call the chat line; so not even a proper complaints process is in place. Will be contacting the Ombudsman if they don't quash this bill and continue to harrass me. I would not recommend talktalk to anyone and I would avoid them like the plague.",0

"Shockingly bad‚Ä¶ do not use this company. They took my payment when I placed my order Jan, 2021. Still have not received my phone and they will not refund my payment",0
Outstanding customer service - best ever had!!,1
"This is by far the worst experience I have had in purchasing any product. I‚Äôd waited months to be able to upgrade my new phone and an experience which should be exciting was instead awful.

I understand it wasn‚Äôt nearing the end of the day on Sunday but I went in and told the sales exec the phone I wanted, not only did he pressure me into taking a phone which was different (I presume they get paid more on this phone) but was also more expensive.

I was unsure of moving away from my current provider yet he assured me I had my 14 day cooling off period to think about it, swiftly handed me a tablet to sign on without any sign of the terms and conditions - foolishly I trusted him. Having spoken with my current provider the week after I decided to stay with them and went back into carphone warehouse store within the next 2 days to be rudely told, I was not entitled to a 14 day cooling off period due to purchasing in store!!!

There was no sympathy from the store manager or no apology as to why I was lied to and uninformed of this - having known this beforehand I would never have signed into a contract. I was advised to ring the customers services number, which I did twice, to again be rudely told - there is nothing they can do and I needed to go back into store again.

I contacted carphone warehouse two weeks ago regarding this and I am still awaiting a response!

Absolute disgrace.",0
"Said delivered yet didn‚Äôt, zizzi distance themselves from delivaroo and won‚Äôt help. Called delivaroo and absolutely clueless only offer refund in 48hr

"Marks Electrical was a brilliant find via Google search for a new cooker, there was a great selection to choose from and the added bonus of next day delivery! the delivery team Craig D and Ravi, we‚Äôre very polite and on time, brought my new cooker in and removed the old one along with all the wrapping, which I paid for as an additional service, they were very professional, Would defiantly recommend.",1
Very helpful efficient and knowledgeable about the product I required,1
"Brilliant, bought a gaming computer for my 2 kids, I haven‚Äôt got much of a clue about any of it, they worked with me and the kids to build a computer that worked for them, great customer service, emailed us to update when the computers were being built, tested, delivered. Can‚Äôt recommend these people highly enough!",1

"Last week, I had visited to Carphone Warehouse which is based in Henry street, Dublin 1. I wanted to buy a Samsung galaxy note 10, before purchasing the phone I was inquiring about the phone with one of the staff named ""ALAN"". This guy was very rude to me, while inquiring about the price he said to me ""this is what we have to offer if you want to buy the product pay here or else purchase it from amazon, don't ask questions"". Also, the mouth of the person while speaking was stinking like hell. This is not expected from a reputed retail store.",0
Responsiveness and professional of those giving quotes and thec contractor,1
It was easy to configure online and we were kept informed right the way through the build and delivery. Great experience.,1
The delivery service is dreadful my package still is yet to arrive and one of the drivers was rude to me,0
Absolutely worse company i have dealt with. Issue of phone not fixed when I had insurance. Wouldn't call back as promised. Get nowhere. Avoid,0

"Really good service easy to use and products delivered the next day, highly recommend",1
Absolutely shocking!! Placed order for over ¬£100 and received one tile with a white boarder for the background but black in between the pictures (Had ordered an all white background). Contacted on chat as seems to be the only way to contact. Constantly disconnected. Finally new one to be sent. Received exactly the same! Same issue with chat but finally again a reorder of the tile to be sent. 3rd time again sent with the exact same issue despite pictures. This time told on chat we need to place the reorder and although they would credit us the price of the tile would have to pay shipping and packaging again! Are you kidding you‚Äôve sent me my order wrong 3 times and I should be out of pocket,0
"The advisor was very helpful & knowledgeable
And mobile phones direct always manage to find a good deal that‚Äôs cheaper than going direct to the providers for exactly the same service. Would definitely recommend",1
"Very impressed with the speed of processing the order and receiving dispatch notification. The camera was in my hand within 24 hours.
Excellent service.",1
Have had nowtv for years but they have lost me as a customer. You used to be able to watch on 2 screens but this year they changed their name to NOW and dropped the price of a cinema pass by ¬£2 but it actually costs you ¬£3 more because you now have to pay ¬£5 for a boost pass if you want to watch on more than 1 screen. They then put the price up for the entertainment pass because they bunged the entertainment and the kids pass together( 2 totally different types of entertainment üôÑ) l think Netflix will do well out of this NOW cock up because that's where me and other people i know are heading.,0
"Arrived quickly, good coloured photos. Reasonable priced.",1
"Had an extremely high bill from

"My Service from PC Specialists was Great! The delivery took just under a month but considering that they had to build the thing, i think that's fine. I was pretty happy from the start of opening my pc box of goodies. Even after finding out that the graphics card had a issue with the fan hitting the chassis. When I called PC Specialists they arranged for a replacemet to be sent out straight away.

Thankfully I don't need to spend 2k on a PC too offen, but if I do I will be buying from these guys again!",1

Unfortunately a I don‚Äôt have the locks or curls to use the product as it was a gift but the presentation and quality of the product lives up to the brands image.

"I've been using TalkTalk for more than 3 years. I wanted to upgrade to a faster plan as a new fibre connection was installed to my neighborhood. The upgrade process was swift, nothing was swift after that.

Openreach engineer came about 5 hours late to our appointment, and did not fully complete the work. He told me someone else will come in 48 hours. I called TalkTalk after 48 hours to check why no-one came. They informed me they couldn't do anything and I should just wait.

Couple days later, I got a text message from openreach telling me that they will give an update in one week. another week passed, no update, but another sms message delaying it for another 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, it happened again. I contacted TalkTalk to ask them why my order is still not installed after 2 months. They just said to wait again for the next update from openreach! I cannot stress enough how inexperienced their customer service team is.

I got fed up and decided to leave TalkTalk at this point. I got transferred to some other department, and they transferred me to some another department and they transferred me onto one other. Each person I spoke to was telling me I should be speaking to blah blah department instead.

I finally got a cancellation, with a end date of 26th December. I came back today from holiday to see my broadband is still up and working. I am currently on a call with another representative explaining to her AGAIN why I want to leave TalkTalk. I TOLD YOU 50 TIMES ALREADY. She is telling me my account is still active. WHY IS IT SO HARD TO LEAVE?",0

COMPLETELY DISGUSTED! Don‚Äôt bother getting repair service with them. They take your product in then send it back saying they‚Äôre not going to repair or replace it and do nothing even though it‚Äôs on the policy if they can‚Äôt fix it they will replace it. THEY ARE USELESS!,0

"Two months ago my son broke his laptop Screen
It was replaced within 2 weeks as good as new.

Two weeks down the line the Screen died again
So I returned it as it was well within the 12 months warranty.
For an Entire MONTH all i got was CRAP excuses
They needed the Charger
Needed to replace the Battery
Was not under Warranty ???????
I recieved countless texts to call them
Yet they NEVER answered the phone ???

"Purchased a dryer with a repair policy. Dryer was repaired twice, no issues. However, when the engineer came to fix the 3rd fault with parts ordered previously, he noticed that another part was also faulty-it had been missed by the previous engineer. (Human error does happen and although it was an inconvenience, I didn‚Äôt mind). Therefore, the repair was not carried out as another part had to be ordered. Due to the Christmas / New Year period, there was a delay in receiving the part, which I completely understood and accepted. I then received a phone call to arrange repair which was scheduled, but whilst I was on the phone, the operator stated that they had breached their timeframes and I was therefore entitled to a new replacement dryer. I received a code to my mobile, went to my local Curry‚Äôs who printed off the details which gave me the equivalent cost of my existing dryer. I then purchased a new dryer which I‚Äôm very happy with!! Thank you Curry‚Äôs",1
Cannot get any response as to when my order will ship.,0

"Pre ordered a new phone in November that was supposed to be with me on December 15th.

I dont have my pre ordered phone! I had no email, no letter, no phone call, no text, no nothing from them.

I had to call up myself to see what was going on and all I got was an outsourced call to someone who barely spoke English and didn't take me seriously. She couldn't seem to understand how not having my pre ordered phone was an issue and that I should simply cancel my phone and order a different one? What sort of customer service is that??

I'm honestly so shocked with my experience. I now have no phone seeing as I sold my previous contract expecting to have my new one already

Seeing as they won't take my complaint seriously or see what the problem is I'm going to the ombudsman to see what he thinks about it.

Thought a new phone for Christmas would be nice, now I have to deal with all this instead of enjoying time with my family.",0
"I bought an iPhone on 25/02 and I decided to return. I returned the phone on 11/03. The team from carphone confirmed that they received the phone and confirmed that a refund would be issued. Since the 11th of March I have been in contact with them and until now I have not received the refund. Besides, on 03/08 I was already charged the monthly fee, soon afterwards I was also charged the upfront, and now on 04/08, I will be charged again FOR A MOBILE PHONE THAT ALREADY RETURNED. I want to cancel this contract that you made with Vodafone, the refund of everything I already paid, and never be a customer of you again. I have already contacted customer service countless times, whenever I speak the situation is being handled by another team and I do not want any more excuses.",0

Update: I got in touch with them as suggested, the operator couldn‚Äôt find any issues in my area and had some useless suggestions such as turn the wifi off on my phone or close the running background apps, before I could answer that I am not having wifi therefore I make sure the wifi is always turned off on my phone the chat disconnected and I received a message: Whoops, looks like we got disconnected - if you still need to chat, you can get connected via the Three app or Live Chat
Meaning my internet was again out or the operator simply closed the chat without wanting to know my answer, still 0 stars",0
"Despite 10 weeks without a washer dryer, and a previous trust pilot review and response the incompetence shows no signs of ending. The issue last week appears to have been addressed with an exchange bokked for today. When the delivery guys arrive its the wrong machine (non integrated and in any case no instruction to install). So we are still without a washer dryer. Without doubt currys are the worst customer service providers ever, by a long long way! They literally cannot do anything right! Now on to trading standards!!!

Update!!! They've now rearranged a date for 13 February. A further whole month away!!! Seriously????",0

"I'm at so dissapointed with the service I received. I ordered a PC from PC Specialist in time so as to have it for my son at Christmas. This was his present from santa. I was given a tracking number from FedEx who were supposed to deliver by the 17th December. Having rang both PC Specialist and fedex every day when it hadn't turned up. The lack of care totally surprised me. Its the 27th December now and still nothing. The tracking is saying its still at Stansted since the 12th December. Fedex told me it has made it to Dublin but was waiting for one more security clearance. To say I'm dissappinted is an understatement. My little boy is still so upset snd has ruined his Christmas. This costs me 902 euro and because I had spent this I couldn't afford to go out and buy something else at the last minute. I'm a single mum on a low wage. I still have no idea when this is likely to turn up. I expected at least a phone call from the company apologising but to date absolutely nothing. Very disappointed üòû

So today's update. Fedex had put it down for delivery up to 6pm yesterday and still nothing. Having called them today, the lack of care is unreal. They said it had yet to pass through customs, having told me yesterday it had been out for delivery. Which is it?? I've never dealt with such an unprofessional company in my whole life.

In fairness to PC Specialist the guy I spoke to today was new and tried to console me. He said there was nothing that could be done from that end as it was with FedEx. I agree with previous reviews in that if you are looking to order a PC then think again especially if you live in Ireland.

I still have a very upset little boy who has lost all belief in santa over this and that's the biggest upset of all.",0
"Nice and easy to deal with no issues, and delivered on time",1
Ordered a sofa on 3/11 still haven't received it. The said they could reorder it on the 6/12 without any fees as they can deduct it from the refund I am due as my order has been lost (how you can lose a sofa I don't know) They haven't issued the refund and said they will not complete order until payment is made which isn't what I initially was told. Requested a call back 2 weeks ago. I am a business woman so my phone is always close by they haven't called back once and the complaints team don't respond. Below on this comment I want you to record the time you called rather than say we attempted to call Because you don't attempt,0

"Horrendous customer service.
Waited an hour to have a notification to say the driver was at my address and couldn't find me. Checked my street, nothing. Rang the driver, no answer. Messaged the driver, still nothing. So I checked the GPS tracking to find he was in an entirely different location nowhere near my home address, which I've checked multiple times and is correct on the order.
I then get a notification saying he couldn't deliver but I'd still be charged the 50 quid for my food and service.
I contact customer services and a very rude lady tells me there's nothing they can do as they tried to deliver. I explain that if you check the gps he never tried to deliver as he came nowhere near my home. She just repeated the same line over and over and said there's ""nothing more than can do"". On requesting multiple times to speak to a manager she kept saying they share the same policy so she couldn't help.
So, for my partners birthday, I'm 50 pound down, late on a Sunday evening, with no food to show for it, and the most enraging customer service assistant who didn't bother to even look into the service but just kept repeating the same line. Even a second of investigation would've shown no delivery attempt was made, but she couldn't be bothered. Appalling. I'll definitely be sticking with Just Eat.",0

"I bought a contract phone with Vodafone from here in the Currys tottenham hale branch. DPD lost my phone delivery (aka they stole it really) - i live at number 5, got delivered to number 31? How strange.

Anyways.

I asked Currys to cancel it, they can‚Äôt. They‚Äôve been trying for around 6 months now with Vodafone and I‚Äôll just take them to a small claims court. Have fun being sued :)",0
"The dishwasher was originally promised for delivery on Dec 2nd and, after waiting all day for the delivery, I received a message to say they could not deliver that day. After contacting Hughes I was given a new delivery date of Dec 6th, but again no delivery was received.

"I recently bought a indesit and paid for delivery and installation with door swap
The delivery person for knowhow drilled two holes in the other side and put door on the other side did not screw in properly screw was left sticking out and left holes so door did not fit.
Contacted knowhow who did not care and said contact store who had as much trouble as me with the don‚Äôt care attitude was informed that a replacement fridge freezer was not available and would have to go back to store and Choose a different one had to go for a more expensive one and there customer service would not refund installation so after an hour and a half the store did as a gesture of good will I feel this was not good service would never buy from currys again",0
"Absolutely diabolical service received!! The service that I have received includes
1. Staff mis sell products for financial gain.
2. Staff starting services earlier than is in the customers best interest....forcing customers to pay their existing provider AND them for the line.
3. I spent a total of 2.5 hours in their branch, so the guy took out a contract for faster broadband (which, I did NOT need) and when he was advised of the same, HE HAD TO CANCEL THE POLICY AND START ALL OVER AGAIN!!
4. When, I then contacted Customer Services, to advise them of the terrible service received in branch, the staff member spoke bad broke English, whereby despite repeating my experience 3 times and them repeating their understanding of the situation 4 times (total of 7 times), I'm then transferred to a Manager, whereby I'm forced to go through security AGAIN......and then forced to go through my NIGHTMARE experience AGAIN/8 TIMES!! I spent over 60 minutes on this call.
4. I'm then told my service will be switched on at a later date to the 3rd January 23!!
5. However, following raising a complaint, I HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT THEY HAD CANCELLED MY SERVICE, DESPITE NOT ASKING THEM TO or THEM ADVISING ME EARLIER!!
6. HOWEVER, FOLLOWING THE CONVERSATION WITH THE COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT TODAY, THEY HAVE SAID THAT IM NOT ENTITLED TO ANY COMPLENSATION FOR ALL MY INCONVENIENCE, AS THEY ALREADY CLOSED MY CASE, YESTERDAY - when they were not able to contact me to discuss my complaint !!!
7. I asked the acclaimed Manageress today, did she not think it was important to ask me OR advise me that they had cancelled my contract, before cancelling my contract.
8. I was advised that the line had been cancelled BUT, they were happy to reset up another connections contract.....THEREFORE, THEY WERE HAPPY TO WASTED THE HOURS WASTED ON TAKING OUT AN ORIGINAL CONTRACT & WOULD REQUIRE ANOTHER CREDIT SEARCH - YET, WHAT SHE FAILED TO MENTION IS THAT TOO MANY CRREDIT SEARCHES WILL DAMAGE YOUR FINANCIAL HISTORY ON EXPERIAN OR EQUIFAX!!!",0
BT Broadband. Horribly overpriced compared to other providers who can provide faster speeds for less cost. Late payment charges applied even when they have written to say they wouldn't be. Long wait times to complain. Apathetic staff who really are not interested in helping. Appalling service and complete lack of customer care.,0
Have used Mazuma before and never had a problem. Prompt efficient service and trustworthy. Very happy.,1

"I have purchased two machines from PC Specialist. This should already say something.
A desktop in 2017 (which is still quite a good rig) and a Laptop about a month ago.

The site is very well organised, accessible from several EU countries with no extra VAT.

There is so much equipment, one can easily customize a desktop/laptop based on the use it is intended for, with a very high money-efficiency ratio.

The tool to customise is so good, it detects incongruent ""assembling"", best hard drive for the OS, unnecessary items selected (ventilation, Wi-Fi or sound cards not upgrading what is on the MoBo just to mention a couple).

I usually buy from the UK website because I prefer an English speaking website, customer service is fantastic - fast reliable and extremely precise.

OS and drivers available online in the website once logged in... It's paradise.

I could go on, but the best I can say, I think, is that I will remain a customer for my next computers for sure...",1

"Used to be good but customer service is now extremely poor. Dad ordered an Xbox game for my son for Christmas. Upon opening it on Christmas Day, we discovered that the disc inside the box was a completely different game.

I've been buying from Music Magpie since 2017 and they have usually been good. When the occasional slip up has occurred they have fixed it very quickly. However, things appear to have changed for the worse.

First, contacting Music Magpie used to be easy, but they have recently hidden their contact form. Now when you click the Help & Support button next to your order, they send you to a useless FAQ page.

Thankfully, I still had the link to the Contact page from a previous email, so my dad was able to contact them to ask for a replacement, adding that we were happy to send back the box and incorrect disc if required.

First they denied all knowledge of the order, having put no record of it on his profile. Then they delayed a response by asking for the order number, which he had included in the contact form but apparently they couldn't see this for some reason.

After he provided them with the order number via email, their response (a few days later) was this:

""As per our terms and conditions, all missing or faulty items should be reported within 30 days of the estimated delivery date and unfortunately, your request has been made outside of these delivery guidelines.

Due to the length of time that has passed, we do not have access to our records for this order anymore, as such we are unable to help you on this occasion.

We are sorry that we can't be of any further help.

Kind Regards,
Tyson
Customer Services""

Tyson clearly doesn't understand how Christmas presents work. Add to that the postal delays caused by Royal Mail strikes leading up to Christmas and it's clear to see that using their estimated delivery time as the starting point for the returns process is simply absurd. And that they ""do not have access to our records for this order anymore"" is no excuse. Not only have they failed to deliver what was paid for, they have failed to keep a record of it. Both of those things are nobody's fault but theirs, but they won't clear up their own mess. (Incidentally, Music Magpie has records of my orders going all the way back to 2017. How have they lost my dad's order from a month ago?)

The solution to this is simple enough - just send a replacement. They have plenty of this title in stock and this is exactly what they have done in the past. But this is now apparently too much for Music Magpie, who clearly no longer care about the quality of their service (placing the wrong discs in boxes) and choose to stonewall their customers when they (Music Magpie) are at fault.

So after six years and countless transactions, they have now lost me as a customer. I'll be using CEX from now on instead, where the customer experience is consistently much better.

THE NEXT DAY: FROM BAD TO WORSE.

Just hours after Ziggy's response, my dad received a refund... For ¬£1.50, the cheapest item of the four in his order, which was NOT the faulty item.

He made it absolutely clear in his original message which item was at fault. The faulty item was priced ¬£6.39 - more than four times the refund issued - and this is detailed in his order confirmation. But Music Magpie have apparently hoped that they could get away with refunding just ¬£1.50 for the cheapest item in his order and that we either wouldn't notice, or would give up complaining.

""Tyson"" sent my dad another barely comprehensible message stating that we ""can still order from us [Music Magpie] with confidence"". But after this debacle, that's patently nonsense. I've got even less confidence now than I had at this time yesterday, which was near to none at all.

While Music Magpie like to monitor Trustpilot and make out here that they're friendly and efficient, they also make it as exasperating as possible to fix problems without taking the time to come here and giving them a public dressing down. It should not be this hard.

Could Music Magpie have done a worse job of managing what should have been a very small issue with a very simple fix? It's hard to think that they could get it wrong from here, but we'll see.

Looking forward to Ziggy's response to this update.

OMG. THEY MADE IT WORSE.

More hoops to jump through! Yesterday they were happy to issue a refund. Today they want me to get my dad to email them to authorise them to deal with me. Like he'll get a reply.

Ziggy, here's how to do your job:

1. Find the order in YOUR records. My dad gave you the order number twice and I gave you it here to verify that this is a genuine purchase.
2. Find the game in the order that is at fault. This is the one that my dad specified in his original complaint to you. I know this because I worded that complaint.
3. Refund the value of that game to my dad.
4. Say sorry.

Is that too hard?",0
"Be careful with currys ive had terrible experience where the info on a sony tv bravia KD49XH9196BUwas wrong i wanted hdmi 2.1 and they said it had it. I tried to compare it with other tvs but currys have different product codes. It turns out i was comparing it with the same tv but i made a mistake thinking the reason it had a different product code was because it had hdmi 2.1, unfortunately that wasn't the case they made a mistake. I dont know why they have different product codes but i do know it stopped me getting price promise. When i realised the mistake the customer service online were good but they couldn't do anything and i had to phone. but thats where it got bad and very stressful. The first phonecall was with a person who sounded like they were at home during lockdown ""maybe at home"" with people laughing in background and being argumentative it was very stressful and was very surprised how bad they treated and talked to me, they didn't care. but i still tried again and the next time they told me they didn't make mistake basically called me a liar even though im obviously not the only one it happened to, theres other reviews that say the same.",0

"I don't care how cheap a deal Virgin may look... it just isn't worth all the hassle and endless explaining of the various problems you'll end up with if your installation is anything like mine.

They even refused to send a deadlock letter so that I could take my issues to the ombudsman, telling me that's not what was needed!

They want almost ¬£300 to terminate the contract even though the phone never worked for weeks, and the internet service is still so unreliable that I'm now using the hotspot on my mobile phone for internet service as the virgin service breaks every half an hour.

I've been a loyal customer since 2008 and was mistaken in my belief that it would be rewarded. Hands up my own fault for not keeping on top of things but I found that when family came to visit bbc iplayer couldnt load. I had mainly been using the broadband home office Internet and not TV. Aside from the slow speed what was a bigger shock was ¬£67 a month price especially when a price comparison had deals from ¬£18. Called and was offered ¬£47 price plan and then a basic package for ¬£36. Finally after pointing out that new customers could receive a deal of ¬£28 I was offered the same but refused to add the ¬£70 voucher that was part of the deal. So in a nutshell slow speed at a premium price and fleeced for staying loyal.,0

I just received a horrendous experience at Argos Finchley road when I went to purchase an item. The manager Ricky was extremely rude and had shocking manners. If Sainsbury's doesn't want to train the staff to save money at least they must employ someone with a bit of common sense and manners. This was the second time I had this awful experience with Ricky. It's unbelievable.. It's ashame there are some good products at Argos but the customer service couldn't be worse. In fact I decided to return the item I bought because I don't want to be reminded of the appalling experience any time I use this item. Such a false economy. Never again !,0

"Absolutely terrible experience from the start. Mis-sold a SIM and Unbreakable broadband, despite saying I cant received EE where I live - sales person lied and said they have a booster which means I will get it! That is an absolute lie!

Received the SIM - no reception, called and told I couldnt cancel SIM until after everything was set up as it was part of an ""open order"", so delayed by a week. I went on to hear this excuse rew open order many many many times that day and the next.

Set up was for a new line as old line has faults on it which Talktalk failed to resolve - no new line, all attached to the faulty line. Spent 4 hours on the phone trying to get this resolved and an engineer booked in for the following day, only to be told ""computer says no"" as the order is still open. Out of sheer luck the engineer (a sub contractor, not BT Openreach) called me at about 5.50 and came to the house to check everything when I told him about the fault - he advised that he was contracted just to take over the old line, not install a new line - he was very helpful and got whatever the fault was resolved.

During the calls prior to the engineer visit I was told by a really helpful woman who was trying to help resolve my issues that I have 713 BT wifi hotspots where I live so signed up immediately - no hotspot in range. Another ¬£39 taken under false circumstances.

Phoned the next day (Saturday) and was told to reduce the package to remove the halo stuff which I was mis-sold and cant use would cost ¬£12 more than advertised, that the SIM would be cancelled and I would be transferred to another person to sort out the broadband cost. Transferred to another person only to be told that nothing can be done as there is an open order to cancel my SIM so I would have to call back on the next working day.

It was only when I absolutely lost my s**t at the poor guy I was speaking to that he spoke to his manager and agreed it would all get sorted on Monday without another phone call to them.

I cant believe how difficult and so utterly stressful this process has been. I can now understand why people get violent - I think I would have become uncontrollably violent if these people had been in front of me - and that is not my normal nature / presentation - I am usually calm, level headed and used to dealing with difficult situations / people. It was highly likely that I would lose my job if I didnt have a working broadband by the Monday which I explained over and over again but the only person who seemed to care about this was the helpful woman I spoke to who unfortunately wasnt able to resolve the issues for me. Thankfully the engineer sorted this for me.

The last guy I spoke to re reducing the package to one I can actually use helped me get things sorted once I completely lost my mind.

I wait to see that everything has been done.

Unfortunately I cannot recommend BT at all and if I wasnt at risk of losing my job on Monday if my broadband wasnt working I would have cancelled everything today!!!!!",0

Thanks.",1
"Abysmally poor signal IN A CITY. Even used the customer service and essentially telling me I just need to reset my phone, which of course, have done 100001 times. When in middle of a contract this is just painful. Avoid if looking for a pay monthly contract.

Side note: unknown as to why my location is being displayed as US as I live in South West England?",0

"Simple facts are that i ordered and paid for a phone on 20 April 2020. As there was no sign of a phone, on 2 May 2020 i cancelled the order and was told a refund would be made with 14 days. After 14 days still no refund and constantly told it would be made as soon as possible. On 22 June i was told a refund had been made but some banks take 7 days. Still no refund from Quick Mobile Fix and therefore on 25 June i was refunded by Santander Mastercard. A really bad experience and clearly not uncommon.",0
Omg using this site was so simple. I chose my style of thank you card. Loaded up the pictures. Pressed go paid for them. Had confirmation email and they were here in a couple of days. Quality was amazing. Definitely recommend you again,1

"Ordered a dishwasher and a fridge freezer. Guys turned up late. Fridge freezer was forgotten to be put on lorry. The guy who installed the dishwasher left me with a leak. Cancelled fridge freezer on 5 January. Still no refund. Not happy with dishwasher and asked for an exchange and an alternative, nothing turned up and was told by online chat it had been cancelled. Ordered alternative fridge freezer. Guys brought it last week but couldn't get it through door and they told me to reschedule with installation so the doors can be taken off, which I did. Guys turned up today, no installation, so they took it away again. Spoke to online chat, they told me installation not available for this item! Does anyone at Currys know what they're doing? I need to cancel this fridge freezer now, as I'm fed up with the hassle. I still haven't received my last refund, so it remains to be seen whether I will get one. Today I finally gave up shopping at currys. I have had numerous online chats and phone calls but still no resolution. I keep being told to be patient.",0

I joined NOW TV for TV upstairs. It was connected by white box which I was happy with. I then purchased a smart stick for TV downstairs for NOW TV which is used when watching downstairs. I had not watched NOW TV for some time upstairs and when I tried to watch I received a screen message stating that the device did not support NOW TV. I have contacted their customer service and been advised that I would need to purchase a new smart stick for upstairs. I explained that I purchased the white box in all good faith to watch NOW TV therefore due to no fault of my own it is now obsolete and I am not prepared to PURCHASE a further device. Terrible service I MAY CANCEL MY SUSCRIPTION WITH THEM,0
"Ordered broadband and telephone during Black Friday deals and booked installation for 29/12/2022. Today on the day of installation the engineer arrived and informed me that cabling hasn‚Äôt been installed due to a block and would be installed in February 2023! Virgin media failed to tell me this beforehand I even contacted them using their WhatsApp service asking if I was ready for installation a week before. Virgin also failed to tell my existing provider that the installation would not be going ahead who had already put the cancellation through. Virgins negligence almost left me without internet and nearly lost my telephone number which I have had for 20 years! Luckily my existing provider, Plusnet, was able to urgently stop the cancellation and reinstated my services. Terrible customer service and experience from Virgin Media as a new customer. I have decided to cancel my Virgin order and will be staying with Plusnet
Update 30/12/22 - in response to their reply. Virgin media came out twice to my property in the first week of December and never informed me of a block until the day I had booked installation, 4 weeks later. You obviously DID know about the blockage yet didn‚Äôt keep me informed. The installation Engineer didn‚Äôt do anything apart from ask me if cabling has been laid and then went to his van to make a call and then told me. So you clearly did know. Bunch of time wasters.",0

"I was literally scammed by vodafone.
I switched to Vodafone from another provider (which took a lot of effort and was already a red flag), and was told that I could pay ¬£8/month for 15GB on 5G. I signed up because it seemed like a good deal, got an email with the contract which clearly states the information I reported above, and activated my eSim. All was good for a couple of days until I realised that for some reason my phone was not using 5G anymore. It was on 4G all the time. I called Vodafone multiple times and had various chats with agents that didn't know what the issue was and made me download another eSim, until I got a message saying that although my phone is capable of 5G AND IT'S INCLUDED IN MY CONTRACT WHICH I WAS SENT VIA EMAIL, I would only be allowed to connect to 4G because when they signed me up they put me on a ""basic"" sim, which doesn't include 5G (again: that is DESPITE the contract saying that my contract DOES INCLUDE 5G).
It has been a truly unbelievable experience and I am now trying to get out of this contract.

The moral of the story: TRUST THE REVIEWS and STAY AWAY FROM VODAFONE",0

"-was with TalkTalk for nearly 5 years
-reliability of the connection I would give 3/5 (quite poor and you shouldn't rely on it)
-more issues after signing a new contract for faster fibre...
-to solve a simple problem with somebody from their customer service team you need at least 40-50 minutes up to two hours, because they just keep transferring you from one team to another, claiminig that they can not provide information themselves - I HAVE WASTED HOURS AND HOURS JUST ON TRANSFERS
-shortly before moving home I arrenged for an engineer for a new house and accepted their offer for future fibre > 2-3 days later get an sms and an email saying there is some problem with an order and unable to complete > whole week was calling them 1-2 hours every two days trying to sort things out (while preping to move 250 miles with 2 little kids) > couldn't find the reason of the problem (for hours and many different people/deps), so decided to cancell everything and finish with TalkTalk (I've been told I won't pay any early termination fees) > Iv'e even asked if they can offer me anything better and they propose me offer much worse than before (no sense) > for more than a week making sure everything is done (phone calls), found out that there is no confirmation of everything being cancelled (how can you be sure then? - read other revievs about what happened when they ""forgot"" to cancel the order for somebody)
-while being upset and calling, telling that the company doesn't work as it should and about you wasting time, some people pretend they can not hear you and they hang up the phone, or just put you on silence (yes, really)
-the whole customer service are quite nice and polite, but this is their job, so I don't expect any different, BUT what counts for me is their knowledge and professionalism which they lack
-what I found little funny was people apologizing to me and other customer service people apologizing to other customers in the background (you can hear other people when talking with them, so they must be crowded in their office)
-customer service is nice but they're BIG TIME WASTERS

Edit: Thanks Amii. I've wasted enough time with your company.

Edit2: It's few weeks after I left TalkTalk and cancelled everything, so it was surprising to receive an email from them yesterday:
""We‚Äôre pleased to confirm your engineer appointment. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about your full fibre installation(...)""
Just called them to cancel, but after few minutes of the lady not able to find any of my addresses i gave up and told them it's not my problem anymore... because I didn't order anything.

Edit3:
6 weeks after cancelling I still try to fully cancel!!!!! They've sent me a router that I have to send back now, and engineer from openreach is also coming soon. I was calling them few times already, but they either hang up the phone, or really can't hear me and disconnecting. Useless. CAN NOT CANCEL. CAN NOT GET IN TOUCH.",0
"Left BT due to a year of continuous bad broadband signal which affected work, TV and recordings. Wasted time going through problems with customer service with no solution. Wasted day with BT engineer installing replacement wire which still did not fix problem. Left BT in December and when I called to ask if there was anything I needed to do at end of contract, I was told no. Received final bill - no mention of equipment. I disposed of equipment at local recycling. Two weeks after call & final bill have had 4 emails saying I will be charged (nearly ¬£200!) if equipment is not returned as set out in t & cs. BT knows people don‚Äôt read every small print word when signing up and should state clearly on final bill that the equipment needs to be returned. Feel robbed - money making scheme to catch out customers. They say it‚Äôs for the environment but I took it to recycling. Simply another way to extract more money!",0

"After finding that I had a missing part while assembling a large item. I contacted the Very customer care helpline & i have been pushed from pillar to post for over an hour. While waiting to speak to yet another advisor. I have been cut off & told that they are now closed. This is extremely frustrating when all I need is to resolve the issue & have the missing part sent to me.

Sat 14th January 2023
The reply below that was left 6 hours ago by Very. Is not genuine, I have had no response from them. Nobody has tried to contact me. I sat waiting on my phone for my call to them to be answered for 30 minutes during my break at work today. Had to give up because I run out of time & now customer care is closed again. Another night of sleeping on a mattress on the floor!! This is a genuine complaint & I would very much appreciate it if someone from Very could contact me. I don't have all the time in the world to be waiting on the phone.

I‚Äôve purchased from this store on a number of occasions.The staff are always very helpful and knowledgeable on the products and lead you to the right purchase without trying to sell you the most expensive. They also go the extra mile and have informed me of a 6 year warranty on a purchase a few years ago which I‚Äôd forgotten about.,1

I noticed an elderly couple having a tutorial on digital photography which was informative, helpful and not in anyway patronising. My own experience was buying a camera for my wife who wanted to get her first DSLR after finding that she wanted more capability than here current compact. When you don't really know what you after its useful have some good old fashioned customer service in determining your needs. The conversation and advice saved us money, we went for a new body and excellent condition used lenses as Matt said that's what he would do in our situation. As it is we will keep coming back, because the advice and help has added value for us.",1
"I've been tied up with 3 for years & can't wait til this last contract ends. Worst company ever, their customer service is appalling. 10 different (albeit very polite) staff will confidently tell you 10 entirely different things about your account or contract in an accent you can barely understand on a bad line from the other side of the world. Totally messed up my credit rating! Never get an answer from emails, the only way to contact seems to be through chat or phone calls and every person tells you something different. Tjis time I'm waiting on proof of usage so I can send it to my phone insurers, one 3 person said I need to register my device via proofsat3mail.com and I'd receive a tracking email, I did that, waited a few days, no reply or confirmation, went back on chat, was told I didn't need to register my phone & would get proof of usage via email within 3 days, still nothing.

"So first covered is worst without WiFi at my home I never will be able call to anyone or answer. My son have giffgaff and guess.... Wow have full bar.
But most disgusting thing is INSURANCE FOR YOUR MOBILE. From beginning 1st have 2 contracts ( and 2 mobile phones ) and 4 yr old kid at home and teenager so think perfect option great. 2nd. because 2 contracts 2 difrent phones, and 2 separate insurance ( not as everyone think but I will let way on the minute) 2 payments going by DD from account. In 2 difrent amount. So you happy. 3 rd accident happened want to claim and you spending hours on hold and with different agent reporting yourself like you think you are in loop. Then you hear soory call 3 customer service to send you proof of purchase. Because somebody duplicate accounts. What?? Yes duplicate account that's mean for nearly year you was pay two different amount for same phone. But after 6 weeks of battle suddenly they sort it out finally. Hurray received phone and you are happy user again. 4th life is unpredictable And you need claim for other phone. Think all was sorted last time so this time should be fine. Hahahahhaa never think like this. Now you her other account is missing your warranty paper ??? They confirm that I have insurance but without that warranty paper nobody can't do nothing. So you hear back office will call you in next 72 hours. Shame important message if you hear they will call you back hahahahhaha never been done. You have to chase them.
So we stuck with phone where display in going and simcard like with mogic wound disappearing and coming back. Wow.
Ohhh I forgot also what one on the person sad to us if you think you pay your insurance and when you claim will get brand new phone forget. They send you refurbish. But when you sign contract and hear about insurance that should be brand new phone. So that nice from 3 they send some one old phone fix to others and maybe by accident they will give my data etc new is new and that's why we pay for insurance Scam.


Update 14/09/2022 : like everyone see they ask to contact with someone over chat. They send link, so I copy and paste. And only I can see pls try later no available agent. Hahahah what a joke. Also I contact with three insurance and same thing collect same data what others do in previous calls and now I heard pls be patient they will contact up to 72 hours and later I heard they will contact I few days. Apologies and that's it just say goodbye. And I bet no one will contact with me. And when I will contact with someone will be heard same story and that I need be patient.
Bravo
My phone is still damage and I can't claim my policy.

"Better alternative: Hyperoptic

PROs
+ A great example of what Brexit gives you: less choice, worse service and higher prices <3
+ You get slow internet for a high price because you live in an old house in London
+ Broadband comparison websites claim I can get up to 500Mbps, but when I check on Vodafone

CONs
- Website broadband speed check does not load due to timeout on both mobile and desktop
- Website chat does not load on mobile
- Cannot login despite correct email, order number, PIN and temporary password due to errors with the web platform
- Max 65Mbps for 19GBP in London while other areas easily get 1000Mbps (1Gbps) for 36GBP
- Impossible to buy internet online if you spent 3 years prior abroad. You need to waste 1h speaking to someone on the phone who puts stuff into their outdated system
- 5 unnecessary emails to confirm you got internet and that your router will be on its way eventually
- Router was supposed to arrive on 22nd Mar 2022 but I am still waiting. Go live is on 31st Mar 2022, so not much time left
- Huge, ugly, black router with massive power supply but mediocre coverage",0
"I really wish I could leave 0 stars!
Trust me when I say...AVOID NOW BROADBAND AT ALL COSTS!
Comedy of errors before we were connected. Engineer didn't turn up and NOW agent REFUSED to acknowledge if the engineer was going to attend or not!
Requested to cancel the service with a different agent to be told ""sorry you can't cancel it""... excuse me? Soon changed his tune when I quoted him my statutory rights and NOW's own terms and conditions.
Been promised twice by 2 different agents that they will confirm my cancellation request by email, but guess what? No surprise that they haven't.
Shoddy, abysmal service, fronted by monkeys who think they can intimidate you into staying with them.

"I have had a dreadful experience with Carphone Warehouse in Lisburn NI. Simply they are hood-winking customers. Yesterday I bought a SAMSUNG A20S SIM FREE Phone. The problem is when I got it home I noticed a label on the package. It said the phone had been opened, modified and resealed. Now when you go onto samsung com/uk/support/mobile-devices/what-is-a-modified-product it states >>>>> The phone has been altered and is NOT APPROVED BY SAMSUNG. SAMSUNG state it `` could be a poor or dangerous user experience``. The Salesman said `` It was ok to sell them and it was because they could not get stock from Samsung that they were buying elsewhere. Samsung state , ```THE PRIMARY ISSUE is that customers are NOT told they are buying a product that has been modified``. TRADING STANDARDS today said this was misleading !!! This warrants going to the press. Carphone Warehouse are , it appears, being forced to trade in unethical channels to source products during coronavirus. !!!

A copy of this is going to the CEO / Managing Director, Government Agencies , Consumer Groups and Social Media. I am not someone who complains easily but at 57 years old it sickens me that this is allowed to happen.

WHAT does your CEO / MD say to this Jim in Carphone Warehouse?

The Phone was purchased at 14:27:59 on the 28/07/2020 in Lisburn CURRY`S Superstore for ¬£149.99.

Absolutely check you are not being sold a repackaged phone as NEW !!!!",0
Very easy to order and came before delivery date great products I never buy any other straighteners they are the best around,1
"If I could have, I would have given zero stars. This must be the worst Internet service provider ever. Despite their speeds exceeding 250 MB per second. The Internet frequently loses connectivity. We have called every day because we work from home, but the number of dropouts has rendered this practise untenable. Numerous engineers have appeared. Virgin Media does not appear to be interested in resolving the issue. I would never again subscribe to Virgin Media. We have never received an apology or any gesture of goodwill. They are utterly abhorrent. Plymouth area.",0
"Apologies for being long, but had to describe the situation to show other people how rubbish, unprofessional, overpromising and underdelivering this company is. It is a shame that nothing in my review is a lie.

In the middle of October a lady came knocking on our door and offered us an 'amazing' deal. 500mbps broadband for ¬£30, BT will reimburse us for any cancellation fee with the previous provider. We went for it. So we signed up for it and were waiting to be contacted when it would happen. Days went by and no one contacted us. We called the BT helpline, totally unhelpful, could tell us when it will happen but assured us someone else will give us a call the next day. We received a text message with the time window of the call. But guess what no one called. So we called again and explained the situation to another advisor, they told us it will be 18.11. and someone will call us 24 hours before to confirm. But guess what, no one called us. So AGAIN we called the BT helpline - not helpful twice - EXPLAIN again all situation around, the advisor did not know a thing to what can happen and when, just that he will send us a small EE router with 4G so we can use it if we do not have broadband and that again someone will call us on Saturday 19.11.2022. But again, guess what, NO ONE DID. On Monday evening we called again, explained the situation AGAIN and demanded ANSWER when we will get broadband installed. We have Netflix, Alexas connected to broadband and one of us is working from home and had to take an emergency holiday. No connection means no work to be done. We asked the smart advisor to give us an email where we can officially complain - manager's email or head office email. She told us to google it and how we should if we do not have broadband? When we gave her this reason, she hung up on us. REALLY????? So we called the BT rubbish helpline and explained the situation AGAIN and wanted to complain about the smart advisor. She told us they need to wait for an engineer report that is installing cables in our area and after an engineer appointment can be made. We asked, how long does it take and she said around 5 days. SHOCKING! I told her this is not acceptable, that we are without broadband because of their failed promise to deliver. Apparently she logged the complaint about the advisor and sent it to higher places. I doubt that. She again offered us a mini router for 4G. I told her we have one and it is absolute rubbish. She confirmed it will work with only one device. I asked her if my partner will be connected to that, me and my daughter should watch the wall as nothing else will work, or if one person is watching netflix, no one can use phone or laptop or watch anything on second TV. 'All I can do is to say we are sorry'. This sentence is absolutely not helpful, resolution nowhere to be found and we were left without broadband and frustrated. And to our surprise this morning we have received a text message saying the engineers appointment will happen on 13.1.20223.
Pardon my French, this is taking a p*ss out of customers. Original appointment was meant to happen 18.11.2023 and the new one is almost 2 months later? What we meant to do for 2 months without broadband? Full of frustration I called the helpline to raise my issue to ANOTHER person AGAIN from the beginning. NOT RESOLVED so I resigned from the lovely contract. NOW we are left with ¬£300 cancellation fee bill, no broadband home and anger and frustration.",0
"You do have to be careful with this UK site, they will sell you region 1 dvds which obviously will not play in most UK machines without making it clear and obvious in the listing.

"Harrogate.

Salesman disinterested. Oblivious to my mother's unfamiliarity with online sales / ordering items for pick up - required because her item was on display but not in stock. Promised next day arrival for pick up. Of course, it didn't arrive as promised. I needed to assist her with pick up but couldn't be there when item was delivered 24 hours after promise.

Then call centre unable to re-route delivery to home. Only thing they could offer was cancellation and order of new item for home delivery. Couldn't refund immediately (but managed to accept payment immediately) - would have to wait 5 days. They would then have had 2 payments

Whole system stacked against customer.

My mother will probably never shop at Currys again.",0

Do not waste your money or time. I have a faulty tv under warranty and have sent it in for repair once. They had TV for 9 days and found an ‚Äúunrelated fault‚Äù and claimed to have ‚Äúfixed‚Äù it. Sent it back to me with the original fault. I have video and pictures of the fault. They are refusing to replace TV as they claim not to be able to replicate. What a waste of money for this paid policy. I am now stuck with a broken TV they will not replace. DO NOT BUY THIS POLICY.,0

"I have now reported the same fault on my line 3x in the last 10-11 days. 2 engineers have been out. Both have told me the is a fault outside. Reported the fault for the 3d time at the weekend. 2 days later heard nothing, rang this evening and spoke to a woman at BT who told me there was nothing wrong with the line - flatly contradicting 2 engineers and the person who reported the fault to on Saturday who checked the line and told me there was a fault. She thought she knew better than these 3 people and told me there was no fault on the line and I should go and buy a new phone. When I tried explaining what the previous engineers had told me she made it clear she did not want to listen and terminate the call. At no point was I rude in any way at all, although she was - she simply did not wish to do her job. Utterly disgraceful. If BT do not sort this quickly I am off.",0

The one star goes just to the people on the phone, who very patiently and fairly expertly navigated through endless layers of unnecessary complications.",0

I went abroad with 12GB of data and received a message after 7 days that I had used 8GB from WhatsApp and Google maps. I then bought an unlimited data package as the sales assistant had told me I could top up.

The data then completely stopped working and I had no means of navigating around a foreign country. I contacted customer service 4 times and was told every time that I was a liar and that I had used all my data. Only when the package refreshed did they realise that it couldn't connect to a local network. However they still insisted I had used all my data and refused to refund me for the unlimited data.

I also had a horrendous experience in 2018 when a contract I pay for got a bill for ¬£300 despite me requesting that data roaming be completely deactivated and told it had been. More fool me for going back.",0

"It all started when I got a call from Carphone, where they said I can upgrade my phone 3 months early so they offered me a contract on an iPhone 11 with the upfront cost of ¬£115. They said they will send the phone the following week.

As I didnt recieve any updates or emails regarding my purchase, I decided to call customer services to get a status. The guy in customer service then told me that I dont have a phone coming, but they said I have ¬£115 on my account?? They sent me to a sale exec and she ended up sorting me out with a new deal telling me that the deal offered was also on a new contract. She created me a new contract which she sold to me saying its the same thing. I proceeded to only realise there were tons of hidden costs (¬£135 approx) which led me to return the phone.

I have since called their customer support who are absoutely useless as they kept hanging up or mis informing me.

Turns out the sales exec mis sold me a new contract which has now resulted in an effect to my credit score.

Carphone warehouse have now been reported to the FCA as well as Watchdogs. See you on TV",0

"Got my oven installed and underneath the shelf for the oven, I had a drawer. I asked the guys installing it at the start to just remove it or pull it out if it's in the way of the oven. Turns out it was in the way but instead of doing anything or at least letting me know, they left it in. I now have a drawer that I can't move and an oven with a door that I can't fully open. I didn't find out until they left and I've been unable to reach anyone other than the webchat agents who keep telling me to call repairs but they won't pick up. They even left a big piece of wire in the oven which then started burning because the oven was turned on as it's supposed to be right after installation. This is not the first time that an installation has not been worth the money but it is the last as I will not be using Knowhow again. I now have to find someone else to fix the oven for me and frankly, even if I did manage to reach repairs, I'm not sure I would trust them. Customer service has not been helpful and has done nothing to try to compensate for the extra time and money that this is costing me.

"I am actually fire flamming furious, I bought some Beats Fit Pro‚Äôs for my sons birthday, he had been waiting for a while to get a pair from the manufacturer to review them on his YouTube channel but 3 months down the line he still has not received them so I decided to buy them for him on this occasion, I paid same day delivery and received the package this eve, delivery was amazing however when my son opened the package we were shocked to find that there were no earphones in the box, everything else were there , the weed and pod box but no earphones. I immediately ran out to see if the delivery guy was there but we just missed him. I called customer service who dealt with this situation like this was not their problem. I‚Äôm so mad that I didn‚Äôt get this ladies name but the call was on loud speaker and made my son record the conversation , I explained what happened and she told me she had to ring the store which was fine , after a 10 minute hold I was then told that this was impossible and that all their products are checked before shipping, the person that packaged the items apparently confirmed this, so this is where I‚Äôm about to lose my cool because now this conversation is now beginning to sound suggestive, I asked her ‚Äúif it‚Äôs been checked like you say you do then what are you suggesting? That my son opened them and took them out and make it look like they were never there, sorry my love that‚Äôs not in our nature and is a big deformation of our characters , I was then told to take it up as a dispute with my credit card company, I asked to speak to a manager as I did not like the way this conversation was going to be told no , I asked 3 times , i politely thanked the lady and hung up. I called again and once connected no one poke as I said hello the call ended 3 times in a row I asked my wife to call from her phone and guess what? She got straight through , I was passed the phone spoke to a gentleman who basically said sn investigaton will take place and now I have to wait 48 hrs for a response and still unable to speak to a manager even though this was my opening question to the start of our conversation ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Now here‚Äôs the thing before I could explain further due attitude of this staff member I wasn‚Äôt fully able to elaborate on this evenings event And now I don‚Äôt want to even speak to anyone else from this terrible establishment and quite frankly I don‚Äôt care about the situation especially after basically been called out to be a thief, given the chance I would have explained that my son had been filming the whole thing so this whole experience will be on full display of how they treats customers, I willl never ever buy from this place ever again that‚Äôs for sure

Update:Nothing at all done , I did all that was asked , 4 days of waiting to find they were not going to do anything , I‚Äôve now consulted my bank providers as I used my Barclaycard

I have decided to cancel my contract and approached the store in aylesbury this morning to be confronted by the rude manager who was unhelpful and dismissive to my needs. I spent half an hour on the phone to customer services who could not help without a contract number which is not visible on the contract.
I went back to the manager in aylesbury who told me I can't cancel my contract there is no 14+ grace period. (even though my contract doesn't start until end of Dec??? I was also told by CS,that there is no email address for me to write and complain to?? So I have wrote a letter to the manager and formally terminated my contract photographed it for proof and handed it to the manager who promptly ripped it up. I've found the whole experience of 3 and the manager at Aylesbury downright rude, unhelpful, dismissive and most certainly not customer orientated whatsoever. To be fair the shop did have one assistant (Wilson) who was, calm and polite when taking my contract details.. Funny that??? My advice to potential 3 customers... GO NEXT DOOR TO 02!!!",0

They keep giving the same copy and paste in every single email. And also blaming COVID for why they haven‚Äôt been able to refund me. And chances are If I get a reply from QMF on this it‚Äôs going to be the exact same response as everyone else on this.
Next week is August, and I‚Äôm still waiting my refund from early June. Disgraceful. Do not buy from here, do business with a legit website. Still waiting on my refund after countless emails and nearly 3 months of waiting for nothing.

"I had purchased a handset from their website at the price of ¬£279.00 I received an email confirmation of the purchase including the price almost immediately. However, I received another email in the morning stating that the price is ¬£329.00.

I called your customer service in the evening and was advised that there was a mistake. Initially, she could not see the first email which stated the price ¬£279.00 however she could see the email which stated the price ¬£329.00. She asked me to forward the email to her which I did immediately. I was told that Carphone warehouse will refund my money by bank check as a gesture of goodwill. She was asked as to how it is a gesture of good will when Carphone Warehouse owes me the money. She could not give any reasonable explanation. I did not want a refund by check as this will cause me inconvenience and waste of my time to take the check to the bank. She advised that the only way Carphone Warehouse can refund the money on my card by cancelling the order.

"Awful experience and now may not get gifts by Christmas.

We ordered presents from studio on 28th November and still have not received them. There are items in the tracking that said they would be here by the 9th and nothing have arrived.

What makes this worse is we have received items from studio which we ordered afterwards!

All customer service are saying is wait and be patient. How? The items havn't even been dispatched. If they are not going to be sent let us know so we can plan ahead!!

Shocking experience with clearly a lack of care from their staff.",0

I had my 6 year old Denon DM40 in for repair (under the extended guarantee) because it was skipping when playing CD's. When I recieved it back it played CD's but shortly after having it back It died. Again it was returned but by that time the extended Guarantee had expired. I was expecting a ""sayonara baby"" response from the MK shop...but NO they offered me a brand new DM41 for half price!

"This is unacceptable,been a customer for several years for residential and business,this year June end I received a call from a lady from BT offering me a better deal, ""saving money"",as she was saying,so I definitely believe it...and why not...on this times we all need to save money.She done the contracts,I have signed them,everything fine,I send my old routers and TV ones as well,I been send some bills that I have to pay charges because I ended up my previous contract so I ask the lady and she said she will figure out and let me...
To specify that she never told me about any others charges,she only said my bill will be ¬£26.95 exc vat.
I have sign the dd mandate and send it through post to make sure the bill is paid from my account..Today I have received.few emails and a letter saying they will end my service on both business and residential because I haven't pay them.For my business they charged me extra for late payment and the changes which the lady never inform me...so I paid today a bill of 147,and for the residential they told me the bill is 190 for 3 months...which should be ¬£26.95plus vat √ó3=¬£97.02 but they charge me extra 100 for late payment.
I told the customer service that I send a dd mandate,of course I want to pay for my service,I have paid all this years,but I don't aggre with the late payment charges because they never send for my residential any bill,if I would receive the bill I would have paid in time ,but the explanation I got from the customer service was...sorry your account been set up paperless...so my question is ...you can send me and email now to terminate my service but you can not send me an email to let me know about my bill because you guys didn't set up the direct debit properly.",0
"I wish i could give Vodafone 0 stars

Vodafone is absolutely terrible. After 2 years with the service I literally cannot wait for my SIM from another network to show up so I can drop them.

I started as Pay As You Go and everything seemed... OK. A couple months later I switched to Pay Monthly, and everything went off the rails:

* After moving to Pay Monthly the app never worked for me again, despite multiple customer service calls and reinstalls. The app opened - but my data or plan information was always ""unavailable"".

* A couple months into my Pay Monthly plan I realised I had mistakingly signed up for some type of international plan that cost +¬£20/month. I raised this multiple times with customer service but was told there was nothing I could do until my contract ended after 24 months.... so they essentially screwed me out of ¬£500 pounds because I ""didn't read the fine print"" vs. fixing the situation and making me a happy & loyal customer.

* A month after my contract expired, I called because my bill remained at my previous Pay Monthly level (even though my device was paid off). There was a ""glitch"" in their system, so that was another ¬£50 or so they would have continued to charge me every month had I not been paying attention.

* The website is awful. They push you to the website on a regular basis for 24/7 support or for self-service, but I often found myself navigating in circles and ultimately reaching dead-ends telling me I needed to contact customer service.

* Don't get me started on the call wait times. Yikes!

Vodafone is the worst. Service is OK I guess, but doesn't seem to be any great service provider in the UK... but they sure can't get any worse than Vodafone!",0
"I couldnt believe my luck when I was given an engineers appointment the very next day after reporting a fault. I almost said ""You what?"", thinking I missheard. Amazing service. And James who came out was a real joy. Polite, clean and tidy in his work, communicative and a fab problem-solver. He really put a lot of effort into resolving my issue and did so with such consideration to my property. He was only 24, quite new out of college - and yet he represented the TalkTalk company like an absolute pro. TalkTalk would do themselves a favour by really investing in this young employee.

"Yet again BT have messed up our phone bill, this time charging for a reconnection that never happened (no mention of the disconnection that logically would have preceded it and also didn't happen !). This is on the back end of at least five serious errors over the last 18 months that ended up at the chairman's office for several months before we were compensated. Trying to get through about the latest debacle is impossible, just kept on hold being told how important my call is to them. I can't find one single positive to say about this abysmal company. Looks like it's the chairman's office again then !

Update re BT's reply. I don't use social media and 0800 800 150 is what i'm repeatedly ringing and getting no reply. You could get in touch with me via trust pilot but choose not to. Your reply is meaningless and in no way helpful, as i'd expect of BT.",0

I bought an ex display 3080ti but it has been a nightmare start to end. It arrive loose in a box wrapped in a thin layer of bubble wrap. The IO bracket was bent but after a quick power on the card was working so I straightened the bracket as any person would as it was just the tabs that were bent and I was happy with the card for a few days. The a driver update happened. My screen went black and stayed black with the motherboard error code for no VGA. Looking over the card I could see that the warranty sticker was damaged so I have a suspicion the card had been tampered with or altered at some point. I contacted Ebuyer to enquire about a RMA but was told since straightened the bracket they would not help. They won‚Äôt even acknowledge the damaged warranty sticker or that they voided MSI‚Äôs warranty when they sent it out with what may as well be no packaging. If you‚Äôre going to resell a ex display at least keep hold of the proper packaging or how about putting them in a pre built instead. I feel like this ex display unit is a con to resell broken products.,0

I was charged ¬£31 for my order from purley sainsburys and all customer service agents gave me the same standard response without a fair review of the incident.

"I will be sending a letter of complaint as the service is appalling! Let down on 2 installation dates, which isn't good when you work online and have no internet! This also means I lost money and I will be applying for compensation. The day before the first installation date, they moved the date out 3 weeks, with no apology! Then I needed permission from the neighbour, which they knew about 3 weeks prior. I feel it was used as a delay tactic as that was just before the New Years holiday, so everyone was away. Why was I expected to obtain this and not Virgin? Why did they leave it 3 weeks before advising this requirement? I'd just moved house and hadn't met my neighbour at that stage. Thankfully, she is lovely and tried to help as much as possible. Virgin did not advise anyone of the actual work required, they just expected my neighbour to sign! To date, I still have no idea what's happening, nobody responds, nobody apologises, they just expect you to wait! I've now canceled Virgin and my god, that was just as painful! How can they continue to get away with this appalling service?

Virgin - Why don't you call me with an update!",0

Chelmsford didn‚Äôt have the game he wanted so I looked online and saw that Romford had 3. So I battled the traffic, paid for parking only to be told that they had none in stock. Later I looked online to find that they had 2 in Braintree so I ordered it from there hoping to collect today. I have now received the email saying that the order has been cancelled because it is not in saleable condition.
So what is up with the stock control? And where now is my voucher? If it‚Äôs not in saleable condition then do that before you put it online. I‚Äôm going to try and order online for delivery but I‚Äôm not holding out much hope and already feel like I‚Äôve lost my money.",0

Poor customer service. Sent a working phone in following an upgrade. I have a video of the phone working. They have said the phone is not working and instead of paying the 235 stated they are giving 35 pounds.

Scam completel scam. They will not honor deals and find a fault to avoid paying value agreed for phone.

Terrible company and poor customer service. Avoid.

Mine was an upgrade offer of extra 100 plus phone price of 135. Being told I will only get 35.

Do you ever pay out on trade ins or always find a mysterious and made up fault.

Oh and you can never speak to anyone or get a response. I spoke to customer services as my new phone arrived damaged told me none in stick to give me a replacement, however online I could re order the phone for next day delivery. So load of rubbish. Told me to try and speak to store gave me out several store numbers none answered. After speaking to someone in customer services for the 6th time that day they finally told me no stores answering due to covid and so just to go to store. Why did 5 previously customer service staff give out stores numbers when none answering so to devote time to in store customers following covid??

I have proof working in a video form I took before I posted because I had heard awful company. Should have listened and not use them. Avoid people.

I have read were people have had the same issue and so feel like Carphonewarehouse need to answer why this is. I suspect never plan on giving anyone the extra 100 trade in offer because they will always find a fault thats not a fault to blame on that so only ever have to pay out phone value and not offer. And by the time they respond to tell you not getting full trade in value you are stuck in the contract paying perhaps a higher value than you would have and paid out for phone when wouldnt have done that.

Don't be fooled by deals and cheap contracts. Reason for that!!



Just reading more comments funnily enough like many other comments my phone has screen burn apparently. Complete scam. I will be reporting to trading standards because an absolute disgrace. Disgusting. No intention on ever paying the quote.

Funny the phone has screen burn but not when I sent it off and not shown in my viedoe the day I posted. If screen burn you would clearly see this. Just an excuse not to pay out and get phone cheap. Shambles of a company. Disgusting behaviour.

I am not leaving it there. If my phone is now damaged I will be taking this so far. Because there is no way I will be accepting my phone damaged by Carphonewarehouse. I can prove how it was when sent and should I get anything less than that I will continue and push my complaint as far as I can. I will report to watchdog. The ombudmans. Trading standards. I am not being treated like this.

Screen burn...liars. seems to be the standard excuse for carphone warehouse to avoid payment. Poor company. Who runs a company like that should be beyond embarrassed. How can you treat people in such a way. How do you sleep at night.",0

"I ordered my daughters main Christmas present from carphone warehouse/Currys (iPhone 13 pro) this was a upgrade from Iphone 11, this was ordered November to be delivered before 23rd dec, which I was told would be the very latest it would arrive at my local Currys store. I then recieved 2 emails on the morning of the 17th dec from carphone warehouse and dpd with the time my phone would be delivered to store then a later email with the picture of my delivery being delivered, that same day I received another email from carphone warehouse 8 hours after it had been delivered to store to say my order had been cancelled. I then went to the store frantic as it‚Äôs less than a week till Christmas to be told oh we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happened to your order it‚Äôs just cancelled. To the manager absolutely shaking with guilt didn‚Äôt have anything to tell me other than ring customer service even when I showed email with photo of my phone in their store he didn‚Äôt even say I will check to see if it‚Äôs in the back because he clearly knew where the phone had gone I then rang customer service while at the store, where they told me someone at the store must have it and they must of cancelled your order manger still denied this. Customer service then said we have done are part and delivered to store it‚Äôs upto you to take it up with the store. I have never dealt with such unprofessionalism in my life to say both company‚Äôs are a absolute joke. I have suffered serve stress because of this which is having lasting effects on my mental health. I feel physically sick and I have no idea what to say to my daughter as this will probably be the last year in believing in Father Christmas surely no manager of a big company can get away with stealing other peoples delivery‚Äôs and just get away with it, I‚Äôve spoken with a friend who worked with carphone warehouse and they have said orders sometimes get cancelled a short time after ordering due to being out of stock but never a Order being cancelled once the phone had been delivered, and the only explanation for this is that someone in the workplace has the phone and the manger being the only person with authority to cancel it on the system!

I was very wrong!! The new phone was delivered, and then I received the packaging to send my old phone in.

I replied immediately as one of the options was to have the phone returned. However all emails were ignored, around 5 were sent and the phone turned up five weeks later. I powered up the phone and it works perfectly, no faults at all. I therefore complained but my emails were again ignored until I contacted Curry's customer service. Several more emails but they are not much help and quite abrupt.
CAUTION is advised if using this service, they can say what they like and offer below market price, with little or no accountability.
Shocking customer service and very slow to respond if they actually do at all.",0

I tried to upgrade at the end of my current contract and it has been a complete and utter nightmare!
I have spent literally days on the phone to numerous people who are all lovely but havent got a clue why my broadband won't work. Turns out it was cancelled and keeps getting automatically cancelled.
I have been without Broadband for 2 months and it looks like I need a new contract now which is proving a very lengthy process. I give up and wish I had never gone with Vodafone in the first place.",0

Absolutely joke I had 5 contracts with three I have been with them 6 years two of my contracts were ending so I requested to move 2 of my contact numbers over in September we are now at the end of December and this hasn‚Äôt been done I have spent hours on the phone nobody speaks English nobody deals with the problem just try and sell you new contracts. I‚Äôve cancelled the direct debits hoping somebody would ring me but this didn‚Äôt happen I called customer service and asked for the transfer they told me I would need to move to pay as you go to transfer the number over and it would take 30 days which I did(never heard of this before usually just get a pac code or get the number transferred over anyway after the 30 days my contracts transferred over to pay as you go so I rang up to ask for the numbers to be transferred over they told me it would take 48 hours so I was told in order to use my phone I would have to as it would stay as pay as you go for 48 hours topped up both mobiles ¬£10 each then my line got cut off and I lost the ¬£10 credit I contacted customer service by live chat as I couldn‚Äôt face speaking to them they then told me the number no longer exist and then they told me the transfer was in progress and to wait 48 hours this was on 22 dec the transfer still hasn‚Äôt gone ahead my line is still not got any service my other number hasn‚Äôt transferred over i was told to wait for a replacement sim for my number I‚Äôve received two new sims on 28 dec with new numbers one on pay as you go and one has no service I called back up and went mad asking why they have sent these sims they are now saying wait 3-5 days for these sims to work I told them no cancel the contracts they told me I will need to pay to leave three the amount is over ¬£600 I said is this a joke and they said no because we have done everything we can for you! Honestly they should be paying me I‚Äôve got no active SIM cards even though I‚Äôm paying for 3 contracts I‚Äôve had my number cut for after 6 years and they have admitted this was there error lost the top up money as they cut it off and wasted hours and hours with this joke of a company to be told I need to pay to leave or basically keep paying for something I haven‚Äôt got I‚Äôve had to go and buy a new sim as I couldn‚Äôt have no service any longer hower they wanted me to wait for 3-5 days for these new sims to work even though they are not my contracts I‚Äôm taking this further all contact now it online so I can record the chats,0

"No internet for the past one month.

I have got no internet for the past one month and have been constantly calling Virgin media customer care! Who have been worst and have not yet resolved my issue! I tried emailing them and each time they have said the internet has been fixed. But I still do not have internet access. I have checked all the wires and restarted my hub serveral time. They also said that it is an outside issue and they have to run a cable but nothing has been done! The engineers have come several time but nothing has been done. Worst customer service!! Very dissatisfied as my role is critical I had to work using a Vodafone MiFi device!",0
Great company and my order for an iPhone was shipped out really quick.,1
"Ordered a reburb phone mid December - should have been dispatched within 10 days. Still waiting for my phone 2 February (34 working days). I have ordered from QMF before, the products are cheap and OK quality but they never deliver on time. They never offer compensation they just says a generic 'sorry' and now 'sorry it's late COVID' - but they do reply by email which is something.

Broken promises, next week, now next week... when will my phone arrive? I have cancelled my order (2 February) and now am being told I have to wait 14 working days for my money back. However I am reading plenty of reviews that say they are even slower to refund so watch this space.

TIP: If you order from Quick Mobile Fix use a credit card or paypal so you can use chargeback if they fail to deliver.

Will I order from them again? Not if I can help it!",0
"Sean sorted out an issue getting my credit back after leaving Shell. He dealt with it faultlessly.

The continual credit build-up coupled with increasing DD payments (that I could not reduce) was the key reason I left Shell. I suspect they are using their customers for interest-free credit! Not any longer for me!",1

"I've been a Vodafone business customer for over 20 years, and a ""one net"" virtual landline customer for 10 years. they used to provide a decent service but has gone seriously down hill in the past few years, no just a bit but so far down hill the business team is now underground in hiding somewhere, I could go on but in a nut shell, you used to get a dedicated business manager / team and now you get patched through to a call centre somewhere around the globe, spend hours on hold and never ever actually speak to anyone who can do anything at all, repeatedly. I need a virtual land line service so if anyone knows of any other providers that can do this please let me know, I'll be off in a heartbeat!",0

UPDATE‚Ä¶..Just received the message below and when you contact the ‚Äúhelp desk‚Äù you are given the run around again. I stand by my original post. These guys really couldn‚Äôt care less about their clients. The people who pay their wage. Shocking service. What a bunch of absolute clowns. Been with these for over 20 years and in the last 6 months I‚Äôve had to contact them every month because the monkeys they are hiring as call centre staff cannot seem to get their heads round my standing order payment. The last few months I‚Äôve had a text saying that they cannot process the SA and I will be charged an extra ¬£5.00 on my next bill for their balls up. So I phone them up again to be told I need to call back on 21st a December and they will see if they can refund the ¬£5.00. I understand people make mistakes but 4 times in 6 months is taking the P and also affecting my credit rating.,0
Horrible!! They are doing planning work but not inrorming us in advance and we are without internet more than 6 Hours!,0

Argos are totally ignoring UK consumer legislation. I took a PC monitor back to store for a refund as it was not performing as it should and as described under product information on the Argos site. This was confirmed by Huawei who said that had the monitor been supplied direct by them they would have arranged an immediate refund upon return of the goods. Not so with Argos - 2 stores refused point blank to refund. A customer 'care' telephone adviser at Argos suggested that I take it to another store to see if I was more sussessful there! She could do no more as she was not trained in such matters. She then said that I should make a complaint to Argos - this is now in progress. The reason given by Argos for not refunding was that the monitor had been plugged in. I fail to see how I would have known about the problem with the monitor had it not been plugged in! Perhaps the Argos counter staff have some divine insight. Product purchased on 07/11/22. Attempted claims for a refund made on 11/11 and then 12/11. I used to rate Argos very highly - but not at all now. Please beware of this company.,0

"Update to my previous reviews: still no contact from Quick Mobile Fix at all. Sent numerous emails, facebook messages, live chat requests. Absolutely. Nothing. Has anyone else ever actually received their refund? Or are they just a bunch of crooks?

Update to my previous review: apparently Quick Mobile Fix are more interested in replying to these reviews than they are to my actual emails. And even then they don't read the review properly. I have already said that I have contacted them multiple times over the last 73 days through all avenues (email, formal complaint via website, facebook, live chat) and I get no reply!! The only reply is via my Trustpilot review which only says to contact them.... surely they must be joking?!

Really truly disappointed with the service offered here. Ordered an iPhone X which after a few days started glitching and freezing most of the time. I informed Quick Mobile Fix who led me through their returns procedure. They confirmed receipt and said I should receive a refund within 14 days. All very straightforward and I remained hopeful...

It has now been 73 days and I have heard and received nothing. They haven't responded to my emails, messages and contact attempts. I have no idea what to do.

Advice to potential customers - don't go anywhere near them.",0

"spent 90 minutes trying to connect to BT to talk about upgrading my mother-in-laws broadband and land line. no joy, so I gave up. She's been paying over ¬£70 per month for non-fibre and a phone line - completely ripped off by BT. Different generation; not tech savvy or using U-switch or comparison sites, they rely on firms like BT to do the right thing and advise them when they are not on the best package. Instead BT have been ripping them off for years, and now wont allow us to easily transfer to a lower cost and faster package that they offer to new customers. They won't even provide an updated router to replace the one that is 7 years old, and tried to charge us ¬£60 for room-repeater units that we don't need. Shocking customer service, and we are considering complaining to OFCOM and trading standards",0

"I have no problems with the TV service. But when my family decided to watch mostly Netflix programmes, I cancelled my NowTV passes.

3 months later I checked my wife's online account and saw NowTV payments. I raised an online company. The said I must have another family member who has an account. I gave them all the email addresses we have. But they didn't recognise any. And kept repeating the same email statement about checking with other family members.

So I asked them to tell me the name of the email they are associating with the debit card on the account.

At this point they stopped emailing me. Silence...Because they are lying con-artists.

So I contacted my bank and put a stop on all future payments to them.

I emailed NowTV and told them this and suggested they stop lying and stealing money and get a proper customer service policy.

I will NEVER use these lying con-artists again.",0

However, Sunday afternoon we received a message from a charming and approachable man, who left a number for us to call him, which we did. The job had been posted wrongly but once clarified expressed he would be able to help us. Retuning our TV set up. And a date for yesterday was made between 2 and 3 pm. We are not young, and our principal is LIFE is too precious and indeed short too waste our time waiting. At 3.25 I called his number to ask when to expect him. Not the friendly affable man of Sunday, but a stern 'I am on my way'. What did I do? What manner did I address HIM? Always polite my parents taught me well. WE are still waiting suspect he had missed the last flight from Scotland. NEVER again will we attempt to use BARK! Cruel and nasty. All he had to say was 'I AM NOT COMING' to save us waiting. Unforgiveable behaviour.",0

"My LG OLED Screen developed a fault within the guarantee period and to be fair to them Team Know How collected and replaced the OLED Panel very quickly.
The problem is that they have damaged the TV in the process.
When I have phoned it states emergency only due to COVID so I did the right thing and emailed them with all the details , 4 times actually over the last 2 months. Each time I get a response saying they have received my email and will respond within 6 days.
I had no reply over 6 weeks so sent them a recorded delivery letter , that they have received but continued to ignore me .
2 Months is an absolute joke.
I understand that things are difficult in the current climate but this is more than unacceptable.
I have been more than patient and if they had at least replied to me to acknowledge the issue then I would of happily waited till the COVID situation was over to sort it out.",0

"Shocking all around.

I bought a PC last December, had it delivered on the 24th, everything was great. Around 4 weeks later it stopped working, wasntold it was a GPU issue. I arranged an RMA to get it fixed. This was a pain as the only courier they use doesn't do collection outside of working hours.
Had it picked up and returned without much in the way of comms about the process.
Turned the power on and nothing much happened. Sent it to a local PC repair guy as I thought it was a cabling or some other minor issue. Was told the power unit was broken and it would cost ¬£279 to fix. After just having it repaired for something unrelated and being told it had passed all checks and was fine.
Went through the RMA process again. Was told the motherboard was broken, which for something brand new shouldn't have happened.
A pain to get collected and despite numerous failings there was no movement on making it easier for the customer. Had it returned but they've kept the power cable so now I can't check if its actually fixed or not.",0

"So bad! Endless security checks and it's borderline impossible to watch what you paid for. For goodness sake, let us sign up, pay and watch our shows!!!!!",0
Great place to order from. Have nearly all parts would ever need for most jobs even have videos too. Really quick delivery. Only thing I would think would help would be certain parts need other parts too. So some sort of package deal would be great. Many thanks again,1

"Swapped to BT as previously with talk talk for 15 years, thinking we might get a bit faster WiFi.

We have been with BT 6 months and it is terrible. Far slower than our previous broadband.
Every month we attempt to set up a direct debit to pay but Bt don‚Äôt actually do it then cut our WiFi off a day after the bill is not paid and then try and charge us a reconnection fee although they were the ones not setting it up. It happens every month, they then tried to say it was the bank not giving authorisation after 5 months, even though they have never said this was the problem previously to which they had plenty of opportunities to explain.

The signal fails every few days which means that all our devices disconnect and don‚Äôt reconnect when it comes back on and I have to reconnect it manually every few days which is rather irritating. We bought a box to connect to our router that should kick in and cover low signal periods from BT to stop this happening but this also doesn‚Äôt work as the broadband fails and devices still disconnect.

When streaming anything it buffers almost every time or the picture is bad.

Customer service is pretty challenging and whenever there is problem which is all the time it‚Äôs not their fault or try to sell us something else to help their poor service.
I‚Äôm really disappointed as I imagined BT to be very good. I never had to call my previous provider and I have learnt my lesson that the grass is not always greener.
As soon as our contract is up we will be returning to my previous broadband provider who were cheaper and very reliable.

Edit- the only positive thing I can say is that once our service completely stopped as there was probably with a cable up the road somewhere and the engineer that visited was lovely and really appeared to know what he was doing, his communication skills were very good.",0

Who the hell is Ryan. If only he had a proper way with words in his replies. They all seem to reel off the same excuse if any thing has gone wrong and then he is happy to offer apologies and offer to help.

"BUYERS BEWARE - If you are porting\moving your business numbers - PLEASE READ THIS FIRST

We arranged with THREE Business - the porting of 4 of our main business mobile phone lines on 28 June 2022, and agreed a port date of 12 July 2022. The 12 July came and went and on 13 July - only one of our numbers was ported from O2, leaving behind our 3 other numbers that were not re-connected leaving us helpless without the possibility of continuing our business.

After numerous calls, emails and online chats which have all proven to be useless, without apologies or any explanation other than passing the buck to either the Tech Department or Porting Department , I have no other option than to write this truthful, factual review, without evasion. Today is 17 July 2022 and we have been without our business phones for 5 Days. The amount of new business lost and the inconvenience of being unable to be contacted by phone has cost us dearly.

Mr Robert Finnegan CEO are you aware of how your customers‚Äô businesses are suffering at the hands of your incompetent staff? My Agreement with THREE has been broken.

Is there anybody out there that can help us rectify the situation we find oursdelves in.

EDIT 18 July - Thank you for response THREE but tried that 20x - no help whatsoever to date, no-one has been able to actually do anything positive to get my lines working - I sent email to your CEO who answered and he sent details to your exec dept at 9am morning - its now 3pm, 6 days without phones and still nothing !",0

"Talktalk has the worst customer services I have ever experienced. My wife's contract came to an end in July and they offered a choice of 3 new ones. she chose one similar to her old one a little more expensive at ¬£19.99 p.m. They then started charging her ¬£33pm claiming she was out of contract and the contract she had chosen was not available. After about 14 hours of telephone calls over 4 weeks, where you are transferred from one person to another to another they finally admitted that they had made a mistake and the contract was available, but that an error message on her account would not let them change it. They agreed that as it was their fault she would be refunded the overcharges as it was not her fault she was out of contract. On the 18th August after another 2 hour call, they suggest that we open a new account and cancel the old one. We do this under my name as my wife has become ill having to deal with them. This is done based on them agreeing to refund what they have overcharged, stopping charging her on the day the new account opens and not charging us for delivery of a new router that we do not need. Simple you would have thought. What has actually happened is they are still charging her, they have refunded nothing and they charged me ¬£9.99 delivery for a router plus a misc. charge of around ¬£1.60 that has no description. These people are absolutely useless cretins. I wrote to the CEO and of course did not even get a reply.",0
"am disgusted with how i have been treated with this company there customer service is diabolical, avoid, still have a phone i am unable to use after paying for it.",0
good communication and delivery exactly when stated. delivery guys were helpful. all good,1
"Why stay with BT?
At the end of November, Community Fibre offered me a very competitive broadband deal, and I signed. Within 24 hours, an engineer was working on my street, bringing the cable to my property. Within another 24 hours, another engineer was back at the property, installing a box by my front door. The final engineer appointment was due a few days later. On 2 December I called BT to say I wanted to terminate my contract, explaining that I had been offered a great Broadband deal by Community Fibre - cheaper and faster than BT.
Well, the BT representative managed to convince me that I should stay, offering me a deal which was not quite as good, but stressing the service that only BT can offer... And I gave in, cancelling the Community Fibre contract (which was still within the 'cooling-off' period). That was my greatest mistake ever!
Since 2nd December, I have been given various engineer appointments, week after week, for almost two months now, but every time no engineer came, and no explication was given, except that they don't have enough engineers!
Stay away from BT! Go to Community Fibre if you can!",0

"Horrible to deal with, won't match the market on offers when outside of minimum term and make it as difficult as possible for an existing Three number to be transferred to another Three account.

In this scenario it is really irritating that Three will accept a Three PAC at the time of committing to a Three contract but then tell you later that they cannot/will not transfer the number (unless you go through a protracted process which will take 30+ days and conveniently leave you outside of the 14 day cancellation period for the new contract).

Three demonstrate on other forms on their website that they are able to validate PACs so it appears that they intentionally choose not to validate at the point of committment in an attempt to lock customers into contracts.

I would encourage Three to act with greater integrity and transparency with their customers.",0
"Cancelled service online for the sports pass, which was confirmed on the site, then days later they took another payment. At the time live chat was still operating, where they offered a credit on the account, which was accepted but never received. Terrible customer support who don't follow through on what they say they are going to do and a complaint system, which seems to automatically close without any resolution to the problem. Stay well clear of this company!",0

Ridiculous situation, no idea if I‚Äôm going to get my money or not. Will trade in with Apple next time even at reduced rate.",0
"Tried taking over 4 lift emergency phone lines with BT. Seemed straight forward. Now being chased for overdue bills for at least 9 different numbers I can work out so far.
Complaints team were no help and have not resolved the issue.
Never come across such useless customer service and so much switching between departments as know one can tell me what numbers are active and why they are charging for so many lines.",0
"I bought a hob early December, not delivered. Three phone calls with uninterested staff who claimed they had resolved the issue and were sending a new one. Refund was given after Christmas, after a dinner I couldn‚Äôt cook in place of the hob I ordered",0
"I have been with different internet providers over the years as I always shop around for best deals and TalkTalk is the worst broadband provider by far.
Their customer service is non existent, when you put complaints in and want to speak to the manager they do not stick to the policy and even when you quote Ofcom policy they don‚Äôt want to know.

I work from home and I have been with out broadband for over a week now, they just don‚Äôt care. They don‚Äôt check any notes on your account, they don‚Äôt offer resolution and when I waited a statement from ofcom regarding compensation for losing work they just don‚Äôt care.
They are quick to take your money though and when your 18-24 months contract expires they put you on the most expensive plan with even letting you know.",0

However when the iPhone XS Max I paid 600 quid for, was mysteriously not available and I‚Äôd have to wait I decided to give up after a reasonable length of time. Only to discover they don‚Äôt like refunding money. They like to make you wait 14 days. After 14 days they inform you due to covid..... blah blah blah. I had to contact my bank and get them refund me. Avoid this company at all costs.",0

First of all, they don't look after their older or disabled customers as in a huge superstore there are no available seats or places to rest.

Filed a complaint and somebody from management were supposed to give me a call back within 24 hours. Been over a week now and still no contact. The engineer turned up yesterday (who was friendly and professional), but the muppets in admin over the phone, didn't listen to me and actually write down what was needed (a new oven door!) so the engineer couldn't complete the job and has to order it. He explained I'd get a call in an hour. Surprisingly, I didn't get a call... but I received an automated text to say the part was out of stock and they would be in touch once the part had arrived. So basically, I'm without a cooker. Not entirely sure what this Care plan is for now except to inject money into the business and not get anything back efficiently. Am I being treated fairly as a customer? Absolutely not.",0

"I have been a Business customer of BT for the last 35 years. They used to be a good company that cared about it‚Äôs customers, but sadly not anymore. I took out a contact with them 11 years ago when we moved house. I took out their Business Featureline and one plan plus all inclusive call package and put my other phone line on call forwarding and unlimited broadband package. The price was costly but it was good and all worked nicely for my business until this January 2021 when I noticed that they had changed the layout of my phone bill. Since then they have been charging me usage changes which are spiralling out of control. When you call to get it sorted they just want to sell me a useless cloud phone which wouldn‚Äôt work in the village where I live. They keep telling me that there‚Äôs nothing they can do . This last week they have sent me to the brink of insanity. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend BT if it was a matter of life or death. Awful company only interested in the shareholders.",0
"So we ordered an integrated washer with ao installation - they came, they installed (sort of as it still bounces around the kitchen) and they damaged the kitchen cupboard door - they drilled through it. Moores Kitchens had discontinued the range so they tried to match - impossible as it is a high gloss finish which is almost pitted - failed to match - wont replace doors, wont wrap doors so all match - instead want to just replace the washer for a free standing one!!!!!!! I didn't choose my kitchen with integrated appliances for them to damage it and then not offer a reasonable solution!!",0

If I could give zero stars I would! Worst experience ever. We have been a customer of three for years and we opted for the 5G box. It stopped working and threw assured me within 7 days someone will contact us to resolve this. 7 days later nothing and still no internet. I work from home and it‚Äôs important to us have it working. Called threw up but they refused to speak to me because it was in my partners name bearing in mind my partner gave permission before and said to put me on the system too! Of course they denied help.

"I just bought (amongst other items) a MSI motherboard. When I started a build with it I found the motherboard was DOA (dead on arrival).
I got in touch to arrange a refund and after sending some requested pictures of the CPU socket was told in no uncertain terms that there would be no refund as I should have known the CPU socket was faulty!!
I'm a customer of many years and have spent thousands with eBuyer over the years and can't believe they'd treat anyone so shabbily.
When I buy a brand new item I assume it should work straight out of the box.
To be told the item is defective and it's my fault is no way to treat a (up to now) loyal customer.

UPDATE - So it appears that whatever I say to eBuyer it's still my fault that the motherboard arrived damaged and for the sake of ¬£58.08 they're going to lose a loyal cutomer who has spent thousands of pounds with them over the years.
What a way to run a Company!",0
Easy to order and very efficient delivery service. Had to change delivery date and had no problem at all. Item came 20 mins into tome slot. Courier very helpful.,1
"After ordering a Google pixel phone online with a ¬£100 exchange deal, I'm still yet to receive the ¬£100 more than 6 weeks after the purchase. This means that I exchanged my old phone for ¬£8 only. The deal itself is a scam with other people complaining about it also. I will be following this up by contacting the advertising standards authority. You would think a large company such as Currys or carphone warehouse should not be able to get away with this. Impossible to find support online or on the phone. Things keep getting delayed and they bank on people giving up trying to get their money back. I will never use this company again. You should not either.",0

Constant updates on build progress followed and delivery was bang on time and very well handled. Packaging was excellent and product arrived in pristine shape.

Firstly, I was informed that credit on my account won't be utilised, even if I switch my monthly direct debit option to direct debit based solely on my monthly usage. Then, I was told, that the only viable option for me is to use 'pay by cheque', which will prompt bill being issued first. I'm still not 100% convinced if they'll use credit I have on account.
Still better experience than my previous supplier Avro",1

When the call was answered I got through to someone in Manilla who was obstructive, unhelpful, gave wrong information, put me on hold for over 10 mins (I gave up at this point as the call had already exceeded 45 mins and to be honest I think he probably just cut me off because I said I wanted to raise a complaint).

"A week ago, after my Old Washer / Dryer started seriously to leak water, I went to Curry- PCWorld, Coventry, to buy a new one. I carefully chose the model only to be told they were out of stock. The assistant could and would do nothing. I persisted and eventually a more senior assistant said the order could go ahead. I gave full information about gaining access to my kitchen and then paid the bill plus charges for delivery, etc.

On the appointed day the van arrived. The delivery men examined the staircase to my Third Floor flat and refused to move the machine from the van on the grounds of Health and Safety. I learned that they had to carry the washing machine by hand. When I asked about lifting gear, all said none was provided for their use. Twenty years ago my similar Washer / Dryer was placed on a special trolley and delivered without difficulty.

A long, expensive telephone call to TeamKnowHow promised that the Machine would be delivered again by a different duo and with a ""trolley"". But with identical results. No equipment was carried on the Van. Delivery Failed, ie. not attempted.

The four workmen complain that moving the Machine up 3 flights of stairs is hazardous. I'm sure it is - if there is no equipment to assist them. It is the duty of KnowHow Management to provide it, and to train their staff to use it safely.
Similarly, it is the duty of Curry/PC World to employ subsidiary companies of integrity and reliability. Instead of that, both firms wash their hands of any responsibity, leaving the customer abandoned.

In the block of 12 flats where I live, there is no indoor clothes-drying facility. So, nearly all residents buy Washer/Dryers because the balconies may not be used for this purpose. The kitchens are too small to house a Dryer separate from the Washing machine. (One would need to Jettison either the Fridge or the Stove!)

Meanwhile, my Old Washer-Dryer continues to leak and I think it will expire soon. And nobody is offering any solution to this problem. Clearly these are NOT the trustworthy firms that I should be dealing with.",0
"The call centre based overseas is so utterly pathetic it beggars belief.
Literally such utterly useless call centre support.
I explain that I followed the instructions on Vodafone website to activate WiFi calling on my Samsung S22 Ultra and that the setting doesn't exist there as shown on website.
20 minutes of pointless questions, put on hold 3 times for 3 -5 minutes each time. Guess what he sends me...
A text to the link on the website that I told him I had gone to 20 minutes earlier and that the setting as shown doesn't exist.
In short... I tell him the problem and 20 minutes later I have to tell him the same thing all over again!!!
Jeez!!!",0
PCS kept me informed of every stsage of the build of my laptop and its shipping. I have had trouble with Windows 11 and was able to talk to real people who knew what they were doing and sorted the issues.

"Shocking service with some advisors, when you are paying for a service each month for Team knowhow which covers support and care as a customer you do expect to get good professional service, you do not expect unprofessional, negligence, cant be bothered staff saying ' I am not in front of your TV I don't know, read your manual, I can't help you, absolutely disgusting!
The wait time is diabolical and we fully understand due to Covid-19 reduced staff are operating but your wait times have always being exceptionally long.
Team Knowhow some of your staff need to show more professionalism and improve on their custom care skills and only referring to some of the staff, particularly an arrogant man I spoke with on 10th November 2020.

I certainly would not recommend your services and will be cancelling my support cover with Team knowhow.",0
"Ordered a washing machine which arrived with a very short hose. Delivery guys advised that they would arrange for a longer hose to be delivered the next day. Delivery was then scheduled for 3 days later for an 8am to Midday slot. At 1pm I phoned and was promptly told the order was not going to take place and the part wasn't available. I was told that I should have been advised earlier that morning. The order was actually showing as complete when I checked online. Person I spoke to had a very strong regional accent, talked faster and faster, and became more and more unintelligible. I asked her to slow down and she got offended. She couldn't give me a date when the hose would be delivered, she said she had no idea. She refused to transfer me to her manager and said she'd arrange a callback which never happened. The order wasn't reinstated that day so I have no idea what happened to it. Instead of waiting to find out I drove straight down to Currys store, spoke to the manager who was helpful and he was bewildered why Team Knowhow couldn't just organise for me to pick up a hose from the nearest store. He found one immediately, and also provided me with a ¬£20 refund for the installation which we did ourselves in about 5 minutes. The in store experience was fine, probably 3 or 4 stars but the massively useless letdown Team Know Nothing service really exposes Currys to all this online criticism which is entirely justified. No doubt this latest feedback will generate their standard response on here which is that they're sorry to hear about this experience, blah blah blah..... just adds insult to injury really so don't bother replying to this. My main gripe is that the person I spoke to at Team Knowhow (and amazing that I made human contact at all really after the lengths you have to go through to get connected to an actual person) not only couldn't care less, but should have been trouble-shooting but wasn't trained to think outside the box and ultimately was just reading from a set script. Buy from Currys if you can take the goods away from the store the same day but if it involves a delivery then think twice before your purchase.",0

"Recent experience borders on unethical practice. Had problems cancelling. Then an unexpected addtional charge on the credit card for using help.

The chronology is as follows:

Firstly, had difficulty cancelling monthly pass. Tried a couple of time, the cancel function did not come up. Secondly, checked the ""help"" feature to find out why the cancel function did not come up. Thirdly, don't know how, noticed the cancel feature appeared from no where.

"I have spent most of the day dealing with Vodafone - I have either spoken on the phone or on their chat facility to a total of nine people. Yes, NINE people. Basically my phone is on the way out, I rang them and I was offered a deal to replace it, upon making enquiries I realised it was a rubbish deal and decided not to proceed. I then found a much better deal still with vodafone but via a third party and decided to go with that. So now vodafone want to charge me ¬£141.34 in early exit fees for a sim only contract as punishment for not accepting the rubbish deal they gave me this morning, and for the privilege of staying with them on a better deal via a third party. Go figure. Best of all, when I reached the point of mental and physical exhaustion after being passed from pillar to post for the last five hours, I informed the last person I dealt with that I had had enough and needed to look after my mental health and please could the notes that were supposed to have been made during the phone call (including instructions how to avoid paying exit fees which I complied with) and the text of the various online line chats that followed, be passed to a manager with a request for the manager to ring me tomorrow. Their response: We can't call you back. Yes, you read it right; a phone company who can't or won't call you back. Even though a few years ago they kept ringing me asking me how they could make my experience with them ""perfect"" (their favourite word). Well vodafone, if you want any chance of me updating this review positively and want to be perfect, then get a manager to ring me tomorrow and learn to treat your customers particularly vulnerable ones with respect instead of passing them around in endless circles like a plate of canapes at a party. I will never forgive vodafone for the stress they have put me through and I will never use them again once it is all over. My advice to anyone considering using vodafone is to avoid, avoid, AVOID.

UPDATE: in response to reply below, I am not on twitter or facebook. In desperation I got back on live chat this morning and finally got to speak to someone helpful (Neil) who has arranged for me to get a phone call from vodafone. This was at 9am this morning. Will continue to await your call!!!

FINAL UPDATE: I didn't get a call back predictably, so I rang again and spoke to person number 13 at least got a decent human being a lady called Nesma who spent a considerable amount of time trying to sort this out for me and speaking to a manager, anyway one hour and 18 minutes later and listening to the same song 20 times unfortunately she got absolutely nowhere. Her efforts apart I am disgusted with vodafone's incompetence, greed and feeble excuses for not doing the decent thing, I will never use them again. My last word: if you are thinking of joining vodafone - DON'T.",0
"Just awful.

The NowTV Stick even though is sitting 8ft from the router constantly argues that there is a problem with the WiFi even though everything else can connect and use the internet just fine.

It spends 15 minutes booting up, then tells me there is a problem and to try again, the apps crash out when it does decide to work and god forbid you move past it when you finally get it to work as the slightest breeze near it will cause it to freeze then tell you there is no internet available and it is all your fault.

DO NOT BUY! Avoid at all costs unless you want to spend 2+ hours to try and watch a 5 minute YouTube video.",0

Found out today that you can't take your existing (Vodafone) mobile number to your new (Vodafone) phone. I was amazed! Vodafone will not do this! An existing customer has to keep the number of the new phone and cannot keep existing! Ridiculous! Never heard of this before with other providers. There is no way I can change my existing number as my contacts are far and wide. I will be ditching them as my mobile service provider as soon as I am able to. Don't even think of going there.,0

"Utterly appalling customer service. I am trying to get Virgin media installed, originally given an install date of 16/11/2022 - guys come out to run the fibre only to find they need to dig up my drive.

My install date has been pushed out to 12/12/2022. I am now on attempt 4 to get the fibre run with just over a week till my install date and they won't even confirm when it will happen. Previous planned dates have passed with no-one showing up or calling to advise the work has been cancelled. No-one takes my comments to pass on regarding suggested improvements to their process when signing up new customers. I have no faith that my install will actually happen on 12/12/2022 and am incredibly close to cancelling it all. On top of that, every time I call I have to ring multiple times as I get cut off without fail every time and no one rings back! Utterly fuming at this stage and I feel compensation is owed!!!!!",0

"Unacceptable service. Impossible to get a refund!

My new dishwasher purchased from Currys online in December has never dried completely and Currys aren‚Äôt giving me a refund despite my consumer rights.

My repeated calls to customer service result in me being hung up on when I request a refund, or told I have to get some special code by calling another number. As the customer it's not my job to process my own refund...

The local Currys store manager was unable to help. I have written the Chief Executive and not received a reply (almost 4 weeks of no response). Come on Currys, this is isn't good enough for a national well known retailer. Three hours of my time used up and still no refund or updates from you on how you're going to resolve this.",0
Reasonable price. Gd product and excellent delivery service,1
"Disgraceful. I wrote this email and discussed it with their customer services when I still hadn‚Äôt received a response. They said they would give me ¬£20 as a gesture of goodwill which is nowhere to be seen and escalated complaint. They said that I would hear back from someone but I haven‚Äôt!. Absolute jokers!

I purchased and paid for a dishwasher in store at Stratford upon Avon at the Maybird on 26 November 2022. I was told by the young gentleman that served me, that I would get a confirmation text message to say when my order was going to be delivered. I got the text message that said it would be delivered on 3rd December which is when I had booked it in with the gentleman in the store. I have had to pay a callout fee for the plumber who was coming to plumb the dishwasher that day. It just went from bad to worse. When I received no further texts or updates, I called on Saturday morning to find out what time the dishwasher was going to be delivered. My partner had taken the day off work unapid(!) to wait in for the delivery too so he lost out on pay. I spent 40 minutes with the customer services lady over the phone only to be told that my order had been cancelled and that she couldn‚Äôt give me as reason as to why it had been cancelled. I was extremely disappointed to not have received ANY communication to that effect. When I asked for a refund on my card, the lady said I would have to drive to the store in order for this to be processed! I spent a further 2 hours travelling to the store and petrol money in order to get there in order to get a refund! It‚Äôs absolutely absurd that I had to get in the car for this!

My family and I have been using Curry‚Äôs for years, so I feel extremely let down by poor customer service on this occasion. I spoke with the Manager at the store on Saturday and she agreed that it wasn‚Äôt good enough either and that I should have been told that the delivery had been cancelled. She gave me your email address to write to in order to secure some sort of compensation. We are moving house and we told the young gentleman that we would be back to buy more white goods and a television so you have lost out there I‚Äôm afraid.",0

Vodafone broadband and customer service are the most rubbish service ever. My broadband stop work in less than 4 months of me using it(new contact) and when I called the customer service team was so rude to me and also it took 1 week for them to send me an engineer.

"What an absolute joke of a business!!!
I have been over charged for some 20 months on 2 BT Sport products (2nd box and HD) both of which I didn't even have or had access to view.
As these were small charges of ¬£6 and ¬£6.50 i hadn't noticed them on my bill which also has other BT products like broadband on it.
Upon noticing and disputing this with BT, they have only reimbursed me 4 months worth and refused to refund the rest.........!
I have tried over 7 days and 9 phone call to speak with a manager to sort this case out and at every call (which I have had to make as every promise of a call back didnt happen) I was told that 'the manager' wasnt available and he will 'pick it up when he's in'.
SO a business the size of BT has 1 manager to sort refunds apparently!

I'm now 1 week in, 12 hours down and over ¬£200 out of pocket...... what a joke this service is from an actual shadow of a company that tries to pass itself off as being 'customer focused'.

Give Sky back the rights for sports, and stand down from trying to being a honest business - your reviews alone are telling you what you're doing now isnt working!!!!! - Treat your customers well and with honesty and maybe you will have better customer experiences and reviews to show this!!!",0

"Morning of Oct 4thOctober without any warning Bt decided to replace the telegraph pole that connects 15-20 houses.
They couldn't get the old pole out of the ground,resorting to snapping it off so they now had a 4ft jagged stump to remove ,unsurprisingly this did not make it any easier to remove.
10 pm and they were finally re-connecting us.The fact it was pitch black and the ""engineer"" was using a head torch to put those fiddly wires in the right place did not fill me with confidence.
We were offline until the 6th Oct, however instead of the 49Mbs Bt guaranteed speed we were now getting low 20's sometimes lower
What followed (46 days later it is still going on) was a sorry excuse for customer service.
In response to my 3 complaints i have had 3 more visits from engineers,20 texts,11 emails,+2 engineer no shows.
While shopping for a new supplier I note that Bt have dropped my guaranteed speed of 49Mbs and gone with a more achievable minimum speed of 32.And if I was a new customer I could have this for half what I am currently paying.If I move to another supplier they will be using the same cabinet/cable/telephone line which will have the same fault so I am staying until they fix it,compensate me,and give me a reduced monthly fee",0

"I bought a phone from a store in Cardiff on Friday 11th December and was told it would arrive the next day. Received an email from CW to say my phone would not arrive until the following Monday. Needing a phone straightaway, I cancelled my order by telephone and the Customer Service representative told me that my credit card would be refunded with 3-5 working days. I waited and the refund had not been processed. What has followed since then has been, without doubt (and I am Virgin Media customer so have some experience of poor customer service, sadly) the most abject, inept, confusing and contradictory customer service experience I have ever had the misfortune to endure. CW decided to process my refund as a cheque which would take 14 days to process. I repeatedly told CW staff that I did not want a cheque but wanted my credit card refunded. Over close to three weeks, a dozen or so telephone calls and I still have not been refunded. CW staff have either been inept, incompetent or are working to a company script that deliberately obfuscates and avoids the quick and efficient repayment of a refund. In successive calls on the same day, I have been told the cheque has been sent; the cheque has not been sent and will be cancelled; the credit card refund has not been processed and then the credit card refund has been processed. When I have asked to speak to a manager, the excuses why this is not possible include ""either you have a refund or speak to a manager. You can't have both"". Then they put me through to a manager who stated that they would process my refund.

Now, after three weeks, 15 phone calls lasting, with hold times included, close to three hours, I have been told my request for a refund has been processed and show on my credit card today. Then I was told that it might be Monday. I await a call from a manager but feel that like my refund, it will take a while before that happens.

Oh, and before you ask; yes I have lodged a formal complaint but doubt very much if anything will come it not will things change for other people in the future.

My advice, borne of recent painful customer experiences with CW staff, is to avoid this company if it is at all possible. Certainly don't buy a product if in the future you believe that you may have to rely on competent, reliable and/or honest customer service staff. If that is the case, go elsewhere. Anywhere. It really was awful in all ways.

Update. After posting my review, I received an reply from CW asking me to get in touch with further details. I did so by email and included details, dates and times of my contact with CW staff. My reply was evidenced, fulsome and left no doubt about the stunningly awful customer service experiences. Naively, I thought that CW would improve their response and waited for the refund to appear on my credit card after 3-5 working days. Sadly, and all too predictably, the refund still has not been processed and when I telephone their Customer Support team, I was told that the refund would be processed within 3-5 working days with effect from a week later than originally promised. Please be under no illusion that the Customer Service provided by Carphone Warehouse is at a level so poor that it defies appropriate description but I shall. It is, simply and completely, either by design or accident, the most incompetent, ineffective customer service experience I have ever had the misfortune and misery to have had to endure. I can not, in any way possible, recommend having anything to do with this company be that on-line or in store because in the event of needing assistance that is honest, and effectively managed, you will be hideously amazed (not in a good way) and abused by their idea of customer service. This whole avoidable episode, not yet concluded, has been utterly and uniquely terrible.

In summary, there is nothing this company can offer that can't be provided at a cheaper price and delivered with much a far superior customer experience, by a large range of other companies. This is the case either on-line or when the shops are all back open. I only wish I would have read the reviews before I spent money with this company. And, don't expect that any response to your comments on this site by the CW Customer Experience Team will actually have any bearing on the issue that is raised. CW responses on this site are insincere and no action is subsequently taken. Like almost all of their Customer Support staff, there is no hope of being honestly, quickly and effectively treated.",0

Nowtv won‚Äôt do anything because it was purchased via amazon, even told me they can‚Äôt remove the membership! They then told me to contact Amazon, who also won‚Äôt do anything as the purchase wasn‚Äôt made via my own amazon account. They can‚Äôt trace the purchase.

I recommend you stay well clear, clearly have significant security issues and are unwilling to resolve it.

hugely disappointing and wont be using their service again, dont offer a service if you cant provide it properly and when your customers are giving you thousands of pounds for a product, keeping them well informed is not to much to ask.

a cancellation and refund has been submitted. i'll buy my laptop from someone who cares about their customers.",0

"Im a long term member of TalkTalk (over 10 years).

They sent me this parcel and said an engineer is coming to upgrade my broadband telling me the date and time the engineer would come.

Then they kept sending me emails saying that I had asked for the appointment day to be changed when I hadnt.

Finally the day arrived and noone turned up. I sat in all day. No texts no emails no phone calls.
Then 2 days later I get a letter to recycle my old equipment. In the letter is a threat that if you dont send equipment back in the post you get a ¬£50 fine.

I contacted customer support and the person in technical support live chat said that their screen showed no information about the letter talktalk had sent to me, the appointment they had informed me of or about the engineer. They kept trying to talk about August when I was telling them it was January 5th. But that they have a 'dedicated team' that has a different screen that shows this information.

When I spoke to the ""dedicated team"" they couldnt understand what I was saying and told me if I dont unplug my current router and put it in the post I will get a ¬£50 fine. I spent 90 minutes before they finally understood why I couldnt send them my old equipment.

Its not rocket science..if the engineer doesnt turn up..there is no old equipment to send back. It took them NINETY minutes to comprehend this.

UPDATE - I have spent 3 days talking to TalkTalk representatives on Facebook. They just send the same robotic automated answers. Saying pleace contact us. Please PM us. Please do livechat. Then when you go to do those things you just get copy and paste responses to go to the website. I have sat at home for one whole day and then spent 3 days trying to get answers to a few very simple questions.

Its not very cost effective for TalkTalk if their employees have to spend 3 days talking nonsense to me and pasting endlessly automated messages saying that they care - when all that is required is a 5 minute conversation with someone who knows what a full fibre upgrade is and why I cant get one at my address.

If Talk Talk turn a 5 minute conversation into 3 days of exchanging messages how is this good business? If you can turn a 3 day conversation into a 5 minute one..why do you make everything so long winded?

DAY 4 Facebook conversation 930am
TalkTalk-Hiya, when accounts are cancelled, return bags are automatically dispatched, so there will already be a note on the account üôÇ

You sent-so you are canceling my account now?

TalkTalk-No, sorry, that's my bad, it's a term we use inside of TalkTalk, I'm really sorry for the confusion - with the upgrade being cancelled, is what I meant. Really sorry about that Michelle.

Update 16/1/22 another 3.5 hour conversation on livechat I was transferred from better value to resolutions to better value to FTTP then to FTTC then to order management. The conclusion is that there is no record of the letter they sent me, the appointment with the engineer.",0

Do yourselves a favour and do not shop here. Shop from reputable compamies that don't buy TrustPilot reviews. Just read on online forums or reddit about the horror stories about refunds, rma's and customer service in general for this company.

"Total time spent on this parcel: 3 hours on chasing Yodel, 2 hours with their customer services.

eBuyer got my address from paypal for delivery despite I entered the delivery address. Their system was not able to get the full address from Paypal and the first line of address is missing, which is the apartment number. Yodel refused to deliver of course, but it is extremely difficult to communicate with Yodel. They didn't call me and their hotline is all automated. I have to wait 30 minutes for a web chat, and the associate just keep on asking me to use their app. It took me more than an hour to get another associate to understand the scenario and change the address. The delivery kept on delaying and I had to contact eBuyer customer service to get the date fixed.

On the day of delivery I stayed home all day to wait for it. They said no one is at home and they left a card! I can't find the card at my doors too. This is very rediculous. I talked to eBuyer again and the eBuyer associate did not wish to help. It took me literally an hour to get her senior to talk to me. The senior was able to move things quick, but I have already spend a good amount of time with Yodel and eBuyer.

Definitely no next time - If you decide to buy with eBuyer, good luck and I wish your parcel will come on time.",0

"Honestly have had one of the most stressful experiences dealing with Argos - issue went on for over a week after my item was charged multiple times on my account, gift card balance taken and nectar points removed, yet no order confirmation. Finally got someone to reserve it physically at a local store, but had multiple customer service agents say it would take 48 hours for my gift card balance to go back on‚Ä¶. it in actual fact took 168 hours, and I was told the wrong info. Probably spoke to around 8 different agents and I have to say Clara was really unhelpful and I would say made the bad experience a lot worse.

"So my broadband gone down on 18th Friday and using the mobile data going on their webside to report, which keep refering me to that AI chat box, so I have no other chose to answer that AI chat box, after sometime, I finally got a real person on the other side, so they say they will send out an engineer out and will come on 21st Monday. Engineer come out and say there is a fault on the line outside my street, he cannot fix it without special equipment, and he will be back in 1-2 days to fix it, so ok we waited and on the Thursday still nothing, so I call again asking them what happen, now they say they cannot fix it until 12th the next month, which is 25 days after the problem was reported.
Great service Vodafone, I been with Vodafone Customer for more than 10 Years and this is the level of service I am getting. I am leaving and don't think I will ever come back for boradband again
Edit: And I guest 25 days is an acceptable time frame for them, and the engineer say it will only take a few hours to fix the issue, so I have no idea why they drag us time, just come and fix and they will have a happy customer and 1 ticket close without losing any money.",0

"Well, quite the journey I‚Äôve been through with vodaphone‚Ä¶ it all started when moving house and myself and my partner went to the local vodaphone store in South Shields to set up our internet. It all went well (how very wrong I was), they sold us our package at ¬£22 per month for broadband. So the date was set for our new Broadband to be installed by open reach! Excellent I thought as having no internet is kinda annoying, as you may be aware. Open reach turns up and says there‚Äôs a fault with the line, no problem I thought a couple of weeks and it‚Äôll be sorted. 4 missed appointments later from openreach where in they never show and every time I phoned vodaphone mistakes were plainly being made on vodaphone behalf. Not setting up appointment with open reach, vodaphone giving times which didn‚Äôt correspond with openreach‚Äôs times then to be told my order has been cancelled and I need a new account and a second router to be sent to my house, I stupidly agreed thinking that‚Äôd be the end of it all. Well the final appointment was set, no show again. So I phoned vodaphone once again, with the intention of cancelling all together only to be told to take the routers back to the shop I made my first order from, I did so and was told (by the same person who sold me the original contract, who by the way looked rather stunned at myself returning this equipment) that both accounts were cancelled no payments there will be no money withdrawn from my bank. I confirmed this a week later by talking to tobi, then a real person who confirmed indeed I will not be charged for any services and none were ever set up. Fast forward to today, I‚Äôve got a new provider working straight away no fuss and they sent open reach out without a fuss, I have received a notification that ¬£32 was withdrawn from my account via vodaphone!!!?!@!¬£& well my partner has phoned immediately to be told we were charged for internet and a 3 second overseas call? The dates provided show that when this call was apparently made, we didn‚Äôt even have a telephone line installed and the previous owner ( don‚Äôt get me started on that) had cut the telephone lines prior to moving out. Vodaphone somehow had our account registered at our old address as well which we never gave details about, turns out they only cancelled one account and the other was still live.
All in all if you want a company who surely must communicate with themselves and other companies via a series blind carrier pigeons then this is the company for you.
Another little add on from vodaphone to the reason I stayed probably longer than I should, I was promised from the first day that the broadband could not be installed I would receive ¬£5 a day compensation and would receive this when the broadband went live, well according to them I‚Äôve went live? So where is this compensation and how am I being billed?

It was fast and easy. Selling the phone at a price they presented on the site :) Recommended!,1
I am aware that Talk Talk often has complaints lobbed at it - and I suspect perhaps with some justification. I can only speak for my own experience as a customer since 2006. It was truly awful in the early years but I'm glad I persisted. The change has been remarkably for the better. I just renewed my contract and had a truly good experience with a young lady called Wendy who helped give me a contract I was willing to sign.,1

"Mr Memory have been my supplier of choice for memory needs. They only stock genuine OEM items such as Corsair, Kingston, etc. and are very reliable in sending out orders for next-day delivery. I have made several purchases in the past year for our business laptops and servers and have not been disappointed with any of them. Their prices on RAM are generally very competitive (very rarely Amazon is cheaper but not recently) and I love the fact that you can search for the correct RAM chips by laptop model or by RAM spec. The CEO Kerry Harnes is always available in case of any problems with orders but happily I have never had to raise anything. The company also regularly offers discount codes for savings on future purchases. I would highly recommend Mr Memory to anyone looking for computer memory on short notice and at great prices.

Thanks very much to the Mr Memory team!",1

"I decided to leave BT Broadband as their service was so slow - we were lucky to get 23mbps download speed and a 'full fibre' company became available in our village, with download speeds up to 750mbps. Was also going to cancel my landline but the chap at BT convinced me to stay, as it would retain my BT account and, should I move back to BT in the future, I would still be a customer and benefit from the discounts that would entitle me to. The cost was ¬£8 more than the VOIP system I was looking at but I agreed to stay - less hassle. But 3 months down the line, I was informed that they had made a mistake on my new 12 month contract, the cost of the line rental was going up by another ¬£11.50 per month! As they were now increasing my line rental costs by nearly 100%, I asked if I could now leave without penalty (yes, I could - their mistake which they admitted to) so I have gone to the VOIP provider. I shall be saving over ¬£25 per month just for my phone calls, ok I had to buy a VOIP compatible phone but that was ¬£80 - I'm still quids in, with a nice new shiny 'phone. BT seem to think that customers have no choice like the good old days and will simply swallow the price hikes they introduce. Uhhh, no. We do have a choice, so I shall now NOT be paying anything at all to BT (after being a customer for 50 years, seems a pity to leave them completely but their pricing is ludicrous!) The reason for the hike? Apparently because I have internet with someone other than BT, so they basically try to punish anyone who leaves their fold. Bad business idea - and a darn sure way to lose customers.",0

"If you want to get many of your days ruined and be robbed, go for TalkTalk. Since ending my contract (after the contract finally run its course) I have been struggling to get money refunded from this incompetent broadband provider. It took a seemingly random amount from my bank account after my contract terminated. When calling it insisted this was an pre-generated bill, but that it would be refunded to me once the final bill was raised. This bill should be raised within 10 days of the account closing.

10 days later - no bill, no money. I was told the bill should be there in a week.

7 days later - no bill, no money. I was told the bill should be raising ten days later.

10 days later - no bill, no money. I am told the bill might be raised within a month.

Aside from this frustrating mess, I keep receiving promises of being called back by the 'case manager'. They do call, but never at the times they announce. It's a bit odd to be called at 14:00 when receiving a message you will be contacted between 16:00 and 18:00, or to be called at 10:00 when receiving a message you'll be called between 12:00 and 14:00.

Whenever speaking to a 'case manager' you have to suffer to hearing about all the many charges TalkTalk could inflict on you on terminating your contract, even if they are completely irrelevant. You will be assured that if you are charged more you'll receive a refund once the final bill is raised. Yet never in any of the five conversations I have had to have about this, I have heard anything on when my money will be refunded to me. In any other circumstance taking money wrongfully and refusing to return it would be called theft.

My time with TalkTalk has been an absolute disaster from start to finish. From connecting my account to the wrong address, to fining me because an engineer doesn't know how to park in London, to refusing to return money they unrightfully took. Literally take any other provider",0
All good and very efficient process throughout,1
"üò°üò°üò°üò° RIP OFF WARNINGüò°üò°üò°üò°
I purchased my new phone from Carphone warehouse and part exchanged my old phone which is an IPHONE 7 PLUS 256GB.
I was told that if the phone was in good working order I would get ¬£200 for it (subject to slight change). My phone was immaculate in very good working order with not a scratch on it. So imagine my surprise when I get an email saying that, I had said my phone was in good working order, however when they had received it the screen was broken and they could only offer me ¬£60!! Now I know my phone was very well Packaged before I sent it back, so there was no way it could have been damaged in transit. I‚Äôve rang and emailed numerous times and basically been fobbed off. Eventually I was told I could either have the ¬£60 or my phone back. So I asked them to send me my phone back.
I have received it back this morning. And to my amazement the envelope is marked that the screen is cracked. However on opening the package my phone has no mark what so ever on it and I‚Äôve turned in on and it‚Äôs in perfect working order.
So my conclusion is Carphone warehouse are trying to rip customers off. What other conclusion can I come to.
üò°üò°üò°SO THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU DO A TRADE IN WITH CARPHONE WAREHOUSE. üò°üò°üò°",0
"Thank you cards were printed with wrong information on the back of them, now they cannot be used.",0
"I liked the courteous service of the staff i placed the order with, the prompt delivery and the politeness of the delivery staff.
I must admit i was not a great fan of such an early delivery 7:15am.",1
"I‚Äôve been waiting for a parcel for 13 days. They will not refund, will not send out a replacement until the courier return the item. They want me to wait a further 10 days before then even consider a refund‚Ä¶ after pushing back 3 times the finally agree to send an item. This is not customer service it‚Äôs a fight",0
"If I could give 0 stars I would. Pair of GHDs ordered a full 2 weeks before my daughter‚Äôs birthday (today) and they still have not arrived. No movement in delivery status in 8 days. Get your courier company sorted, GHD! Ended up ordering from Amazon 2 days ago and they arrived yesterday.",0
Terrible service and poor communication. Took almost an hour to return an unused phone. The staff didn‚Äôt care one bit. Last time I visit this dump.,0
Amazing quick service even on back holiday,1
"Helpful with the order,delivered when said you would and happy will use you again Thank You.",1
"I recently received a letter on Tuesday (15th Mar) about the upcoming huge above inflation price increase of over 9% for a company that is already making a profit in the billions. I was not happy when I received this letter and the notice given (Mar 31 price increase). This is especially embarrassing for a company that is supposed to be a communications company.

If this is not pure greed I really don't know what is. Furthermore, It seems that its not possible to move without a significant penalty of ¬£145 which quite frankly I find quite astonishing.

I actually put in a formal complaint about the amount of notice/price increase provided by BT. What actually happens is that a friendly call centre chap rings and in a very nice way tells you how it is and then asks my permission to close it - I actually wanted to complain to the ombudsman about this but it seems it won't go further. I'm actually surprised that its not possible to switch companies when such an extortionate price hike is imposed - I would have thought this would be restrictive practise but I was clearly informed there would be a circa ¬£145 penalty charge - I'm truly lost for words. I will be moving from this organisation when I am able to and will be staying away for as long as possible - I would encourage other customers to do the same as there are very competitive deals out there. It seems the only way to send a message to these organisations is to switch regularly and I would encourage this as you will be saving a significant amount of money. The moneysavingsexpert website has some very good advice on how to switch - it is very easy to do and if you've had a similar experience, it would be beneficial to share this as widely as possible so people don't risk spending more than they need to on broadband. A quick search on switching sites (E.g. moneysavingsexpert) will give you an idea of how much money you can save. Don't forget, this is YOUR hard earned money - don't let a simple search that takes minutes stop you from switching and saving you money.

In summary, I would say the best way to get the best value for money is to switch regularly and if enough people start doing this, perhaps these restrictive contracts may change. The best way to achieve these savings is to regularly remind customers that switching saves you money - it's your hard earned money - don't give it away for the sake of a few minutes of searching on the internet - There are some great deals out there.",0
"Needed a calendar for a present, it‚Äôs so easy to personalise with your own photos. The quality is so good and delivery excellent. Wouldn‚Äôt use any other site have always been satisfied with my purchases.",1
"I ordered several items, most of which were fine. One mug however was printed upside down and photos went off the end of the mug. I contacted snapfish via the chat function as the phone number on the website says it's not a real number when you call it. I was promised a replacement mug, and I checked they knew which one I needed. Sure enough the replacement arrived - THE WRONG MUG from my order was replaced. I went to the chat again and was told a supervisor would email that same day to resolve the issue. No email. Chat again - promised an email again - and still no email or useable mug (intended as a gift).",0
Great service and very competitive price.,1
Took 10 days to receive using their courier then claimed device was scratched which it wasn‚Äôt (took pictures) and offered 50 pounds less. Disgraceful behaviour,0

I am sure they will not be coming due to the weather . My family member stayed in the new house from 9am to 4:35pm now but they still not showing up, they just wasting others time and I dont believe they will be coming by the day.

"Have had an awful experience on my first time using carphone. Ordered the iphone 11 oncontract, dpd failed to deliver it 3 days in a row due to incomplete delivery adress provided by the carphone team. This has led to an exhausting back and forth for 4 days now between dpd and carphone with the result being that the phone is going back to carphone and i cant even cancel the order of contract due to their system apparently being down, typical excuse as both the live team ive been speaking to and dpd live team have passed blame the entire time and have got to no resolution. Its up in the air as to wether im to pay for a phone that i havent and probably wont recieve, dont use this company, in my experience its not worth the trouble. ps. There phone lines are shut on weekends and live chat ends at 6pm, so if youre a working man like myself they basically dont want to deal with you, theyve lost any current and future business with me.",0

"Carphone warehouse is a complete scam. I called up up about getting a new phone and I went through the whole process and bought the phone on contract. I was told that I would receive the following day. I waited and DPD sent me a message stating that my phone is being returned to carphone warehouse but since I did not receive a direct message from carphone warehouse I thought this may be wrong. I then went to call up carphone warehouse and was told several excuses by several people about why I wouldn‚Äôt receive the phone such as fraud and verification checks.
This did not make sense to me as I did a verification and credit check over the phone.

They stated that they are going to give me a full refund but the thing that has angered me the most is the fact they have carried out a hard search credit check which has bought down my credit score. I have asked to be compensated for this and they have basically stated no.

The customer service was appalling whilst I was trying to get the problem rectified. Carphone Warehouse wasn‚Äôt even the ones to tell me that they cancelled the order. They carried out a hard credit check, which I was told I passed. I was also promised I would receive a phone. Also they didn‚Äôt even cancel my contract with the mobile network.

So I would advise all to avoid this company.
No wonder EE and 02 have discontinued their contract with them.",0

Most people with a brain might pass an email, maybe even a note, to call back, but no. They have now been charging me for nothing for a YEAR! And because I called before claim they wont refund.

Perhaps the tablet doesn't even work at all!!

CEX - FYI - the Tablet appears to have a some sort of micro usb-c power input! Why have we received a micro mini usb plug with the tablet?

I cannot believe that the order was placed on the 23rd of November and here we are still having to sort out issues! Not good enough CEX!",0

Not a single agent was able to help and simply passed me from one department to another, often waiting up to an hour before anybody responded. Worst customer service experience ever. Even trying to cancel my contract and close my account - which I decided to do after realising I was getting nowhere - proved a complete headache.

"Kirkcaldy store, Clare the saleswoman was knowledgeable and terrific. Delivery & installation of washing machine was a MAJOR disappoint-ment. Machine brought into house, water pipes hooked up, but electrical plug-in not done as cable would have to snake inside, and behind a cabinet to reach a plug. They said they don't do anything ""electrical"" and left. Hubby and I--two 70 year olds--then left to figure out how to plug machine in. Ultimately, we cut a hole in sidewall of cabinet and threaded the cable through down to the plug. We then had to maneuver the washer, and the dish-washer (which had been pulled out in order to snake the cable in back of the cabinet) back into the allotted side-by-side space. Washer was not levelled and it was not tested if it worked or for leaks before they left. So what did we pay for? We PAID for delivery--which they did, so no problem. We PAID for installation--which to our mind they did NOT do. The paperwork we received when we bought the machine said that everything would be done so we were ""satisfied"" -- and WE WERE NOT. Since then, we have heard from various neighbours and friends about the problems THEY had with Curry's, and in story after story, service had fallen short. WAKE UP CURRYS--you're losing your sales base with crappy service, and Appliances Direct looks better and better to dissatisfied customers...",0

"Rubbish. I booked the installation of a gas cooker through these clowns, and paid extra for a specific delivery slot. They still hadn't turned up half an hour after the end of the delivery slot and hadn't bothered to contact me at any point to let me know what was going on. When they did arrive, the technician had put his back out and was unable to install (this I can just about accept, things happen).

The technicIan was however able to survey the site and say that they would be able to do the installation, and booked it in for a later date. On that date another technician turned up, took one look and said he would not be able to do the installation as it was ""company policy"" to replace steel pipes and he would have to knock down half the wall to do it.

Customer complaints refused me compensation on the grounds that monetary value can't be put on inconvenience.

I got a proper gas engineer in to fit it in the end, someone who actually knew what he was doing.

Uncommunicative, incompetent, tight-fisted and completely lacking in customer service skills. Have I left anything out?",0

"Ordered Now TV broadband as a cost saving exercise when Virgin Media announced they'd rather see us go than negotiate a better price than their proposed ¬£77 a month for landline and internet.

Sure, the headline speed is slower, but NowTV were honest from the outset as to what speeds we could expect.

Had originally ordered Vodafone fibre but cancelled the order after they were incapable of sending a contract with the correct price on it.

Line was installed right on time by Openreach, number transferred over fine, broadband live the same day and has been faster than estimated, and absolutely rock stable.

My partner and I both work from home, involved in multiple Teams video conferences daily, we stream 4K Netflix, and have multiple smart devices connected.

Everything works flawlessly, WiFi range to every corner of our three bedroom house, no drop-outs, no disconnects, no slow downs, no buffering on Teams or streaming services, I'm really, really impressed.

For ¬£21 a month including 80mb FTTC, anytime calls and a dual band Wireless-AC router I am really chuffed.

NowTV clearly have a very solid backhaul / network for the fibre to perform so consistently.

Keep it up!",1

"** LATEST UPDATE ADDED AT THE BOTTOM **

Atrocious company.

04-02-2020 Submitted a trade-in order online.

08-02-2020 Finally received packaging to send phone to CPW.

10-02-2020 Posted parcel at local post office. Provided with confirmation and tracking details.

12-02-2020 Royal Mail attempted delivery to CPW warehouse in Newark. Tracking stated ‚Äúpremises inaccessible‚Äù?!?

12-02-2020 Called customer services (in South Africa!) Agent escalated to find out why ‚Äúpremises inaccessible‚Äù. Advised I would receive a call within 24/48 hours.

13-02-2020 No call from CPW.

14-02-2020 No call from CPW.

14-02-2020 Royal Mail tracking confirms parcel delivered to CPW @ 12:55pm 14-02-2020.

18-02-2020 Still no contact or confirmation from CPW.

18-02-2020 Called customer services (in South Africa).

During the 40 minute conversation I received 4 different responses - from ‚Äúthe warehouse hasn‚Äôt received it‚Äù to ‚Äúif you want an update call into one of the CPW stores‚Äù (NO!) to ‚Äúthe phone was received at the warehouse on 14-02 but it takes 3-5 working days for the trade-in to be processed‚Äù. INCORRECT. Process states ‚Äúphone checked and trade-in value processed within 24 hours. Appears in account within 3-5 days‚Äù.

Advised to wait another 48 hours before chasing again. Another escalation submitted by the agent (which won‚Äôt be followed up) and a complaint, which also won‚Äôt be followed up.

All reviews regarding trading in a phone with CPW are pretty accurate - appalling and a con.

"Bought a new laptop in December for my daughter to be able to take part in her schooling from home from their online store. Straight from the start the laptop would freeze randomly. I thought maybe it was a one off or needs updating etc, tried all of this and then even did Windows reinstall few times. No logs in the event log so was pointing towards a hardware fault.

Tried to contact them online for a return but was unable to get through on countless occasions. Finally after a week or so (mid Jan) managed to get through to them only to be told I need to take the laptop into a local store as that was the process..

Took it to the Beckton store only to be told I should have done it online.. Then after pressing them about the countless times I have failed to get in touch and then being told to bring it in store they decided to take a look, at first they could not find the order in the system, so I had to spend ages out in the freezing cold only for them to come back to me asking for me to forward them my order details. Finally they agreed to take it in for repairs under warranty even even though I wanted a replacement or refund, when I pressed on this they said it was a HP matter and that they will be the ones to repair it under warranty. By this point it was almost an hour so I gave in to their demands, however they then started accusing me of being difficult when I tried to hand the laptop in the box it came in, even the Manager Shaik? got involved and was shouting at me, this is the worst customer service I have received in my life.

Got a text message the night before the expected collection date saying my laptop is ready to be collected.. I am just waiting for the store to open now to go get it.
But having read all the horror stories on here I am not holding my breath that they have actually done anything.

I will update this post once I have picked up the laptop. Funny thing is they have not even got in touch since dropping the laptop telling me what was done with it (if anything) and I am not looking forward to dealing with their rude CS staff in store either. wish me luck...

Update - Went to collect laptop today. It had scratches and a chip on the tracking pad that wasn't there before. I raised this with them and they said that apparently it was already there before. I stood my ground as asked to speak to a manager. The report said the Windows install was corrupted and out of date, even though I did a clean install and updates already?? Also apparently they decided the laptop had to be opened up and the heatsink needed cleaning and also a few screws were tightened to stop the issue happening again!! This is a laptop that is less then a month old, only used for about a week.

Anyway long story short they were unable to replace it for me, even though now my daughter will be without a laptop for even longer and miss out on her live lessons. I guess I should be happy they even decided to refund me. I now know to stay clear of Currys, better to pay more and buy from a more reliable retailer.",0

"No fuss, no trouble.

"PC Specialist was a pleasure from start to finish

Not only did they build my PC with the best cable management I have ever seen but they was the best on price for a top quality build! I spoke to the team on the phone more than once and every one of them was great to talk to.

I want to thank the whole team for a great PC at a great price and a special thanks to Dylan Ho for going the extra mile to get my PC to me for my 40th Birthday!",1
"Absolutely shocking service. Integrated cooker installed incorrectly, waited over an hour to speak someone to be fobbed off that they will call back the following week. Surprisingly no call back received, manage to get a response via twitter to be told it will be another 3 weeks for the issue to be rectified. Not even offered a refund for the cost of installation and now we are without an oven with a baby due any day. Wouldn‚Äôt bother using these clowns for any installation, repairs etc.",0
"Really really good. I really hope HMV grows back to how it was in the 90s

"Nenad was able to answer my questions and update the details of my account. He did this politely and efficiently. I called 30 mins earlier with the same request. I spoke to someone else who said she couldn't do it and put me on hold for over 20 mins. Great that Nenad could help, but why was his colleague unable to deal with it?",1

"I bought a phone for ¬£99.99, the amount was confirmed in the basket and in the purchase confirmation e-mail.

Yet they took ¬£499 out of my account.

I received a cancellation e-mail and expected the pending transaction to disappear but instead the full amount was taken from my account.

One customer service rep denied to customers that any extra money had been taken and said we would only be refunded the ¬£99.99.

Other customers having the same issue as me have been lied to about when their refunds were processed.",0
I have been with three for 13 YEARS. I‚Äôve had a contract with them for my current number for 3 years and not once have a received a good deal or any gratitude for being a loyal customer. They are expecting me to pay ¬£15 so that I can use my normal allowance for 7 days abroad. On top of this. I‚Äôve asked them TWICE if I will have any extra costs when I go abroad and both times they said NO. company is really bad. Avoid. As soon as my contract ends I will be moving to o2 and will never recommend three to anyone,0
"Excellent service by phone and in person from Ben at the Plymouth store. Ben was extremely helpful with the purchase of a 4K recorder and subsequent assistance to source an, unrelated, TV connecting lead.",1

"Great service, ordered and dispatched same day.",1
They look great! Brilliant quality and completely accurate. My daughter was so pleased with her birthday invitations - thank you!,1
Don‚Äôt bother 6 weeks of being fobbed off. Pushed from pillar to post 3 engineer call outs less than a week‚Äôs worth of internet use in 6 weeks and no one knows what they are doing. Still being charged for internet usage when you have none. Having to wait a week at a time for an engineer call out. Pathetic company and pathetic service.,0
Disgusting that you pay monthly for this service and it shoves adverts down your throat even before you watch a film. I can't wait to delete this app for good.,0
"Easy ordering process and quick delivery. The dresses I ordered were of good quality and as described on line. However, I did return two as they did not suit me.",1

Great service and personal contact/advice. Why buy anywhere else?,1
"So I purchased a 2 month movies pass and redeemed this on the 28th August, I cancelled the pass so after the 2 months I'm not automatically charged the standard rate per month. It is only letting me have 1 months viewing though. Says I can only watch until 28th September! I got on live chat and the guy basically said it's my fault for cancelling too early before disconnecting me. I have no idea how this is fair, I've paid for 2 months but I'm only being allowed one. Absolute joke.",0
BT and open reach Absolutely not fit for purpose and shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to trade. Nearly 3 months in to try to get service with fibre DP on pole outside my house and cable already into property. Everyone in the chain is lying to everyone else with zero accountability. Utterly disgusting service -BTS customer service are nice but pointless as they get incorrect information from open reach which they just tell you and say nothing can be done -how they put up with working with open reach is astounding-if these companies actually had to survive on the merit of their work rather than a monopoly on infrastructure (which is going to stop) they would not last a month -utterly shambolic service,0
Just started used the app but I have found it super easy to navigate and the missions are keeping me occupied too,1
"The print quality was horrendous, ordered thank you cards for my wedding guests , also there was a print error. This could of been easily seen on there printing,

"I have been with Geeksquad (now Team Knowhow) for as long as I can remember and not once in all this time have I not ended the call by feeling really glad I had called them. All the agents are very knowledgable, polite, go out of their way to help and have always resolved my problems without making me feel stupid. In fact, I can‚Äôt praise them enough and don‚Äôt know what I would do without them.",1
The condition of the game box was great and the game in general is amazing and I was glad I got it,1
Reliable and efficient service.,1
"After finding the perfect appliance I was able the choose the date I wanted it delivered which is what I really liked.
Notifications on delivery was great and delivery driver was friendly and professional and helpful.
Will definitely buy from Marks Electrical again.
A stress free experience.",1
"Where to start?

I‚Äôve left several complaints verbally and had no response. I was told my complaints were being elevated and had no response. I‚Äôve written two formal complaints and had no response. I then left a review 6 weeks ago and got a reply on here which told me to email their Trust Pilot team email address. Would you believe it, I‚Äôve had no response to that email either!
My initial complaints were written last year...

Don‚Äôt waste your time trying to get anyone to review complaints because it won‚Äôt happen.

They‚Äôre undoubtedly the worst company I‚Äôve ever dealt with. Thankfully I‚Äôve managed to warn a few others from using the company and saved them the pain.

Stay away!!",0
"Just so clunky and terrible. I find it bizarre.

Also not compatible with google chromebooks anymore which they don‚Äôt tell you while creating an account and paying...",0
Still waiting for a response from contact page as still no parcel arrived,0
There was a button to press for better quality photos for free. After clicking it they looked the same so I continued with the order but unfortunately the pictures on the calendar look underexposed and over saturated. I would have left this box unticked had they shown how the pictures would be altered.,0
Took over a week to turn up! And came with no accessories! Disappointed to say these least,0
"On the 27/02/2020 I had sent my phone off for a repair via store no. 73**. On the 09/08/2020 I recieved the news I was waiting for in regards to my repair from the Knowhow team. My phone was not repairable and I was issued an upgrade. I was told the store would recieve my phone within the next few working days. A few days had passed and I had not heard from the store so I decided to call the Knowhow service number that I had been given, this was on the 15/08/2020, the lady I spoke to advised there is no reason the phone shouldnt be in store. On that day I decided to pop in to the store and upon arrival realised it was closed. The Next day,16/08/2020 I popped back into the store and after a long wait, I was served, the Branch manager confirmed the phone has not yet been delivered, which was quite confusing, as it shouldve been. Whilst at the store I called the Knowhow team again, and this time the lady I spoke to told me the phone I was upgraded to is no longer avilable and I'll need to be upgraded again, so I agreed and was told the Phone will be delivered to my home by Tuesday 18/08/2020. 18/08/2020 - I wait the whole day and no delivery so pop back into the store to make sure its not been delivered there instead. I'm told that it has'nt been. 19/08/202 - I was advised to call in by this day if the phone is not delivered. Calling the Knowhow team I am told the delivery has been successfull but to the store not my home address, I ask the colleague to confirm that it has definitely been delivered to the store and she aggrees to find out and give me a call back. I am not able to attend her call back and so the managee leaves me a voice mail, which i have saved, confirming that the phone is in the store and awaiting my collection. I arrive at the store and the customer consultant, Jos*** who is at this time serving another customer, gave me a funny look and passively asking what i want, so frustratingly I tell him that apparently the phones been delivered to you and so he responds in a passive and aggressive way describing that it hasn't and accuses me of swearing at him.Thereafter I immediately called Knowhow to understand what is going on. To***, Branch Manager, after around 10/15mins of me standing and waiting to be served, decides to go to the back to check if the phone has been delivered or not. In the meantime the knowhow lady on the phone tells me that she is holding 'my phone' in her hand and will have it delivered tomorrow to my home address.

The following day I wake up to receive a notification that the phone has been delivered by DPD. However this item was not delivered to my home.
Worryingly I call up know-how to find out what's going on, I ask them to confirm the address on the parcel was correct and they did. So now I'm even more confused and worried, the lady tells me you'll have to do the running around and find the phone yourself with no offer of any sort of help. Upon delivery DPD take a picture of the lower half of the house door, walking around my street I manage to find a house that's identical, I knock on the door and after a whole load of hassle I receive my phone only to see that Know-how provided the incorrect address to DPDüòê.
I have been offered a mere ¬£15 as a good will gesture for all this hassle which I still haven't received.

Complaint 1 - Outside the store the closure time stated the store closes at 8pm and I arrived around 6:30pm to find out the next day that it closed at 6pm.
Complaint 2 - 15/08/2020 - why didnt knowhow look in to what the issue is that i had to wait for the kind lady the next day to check and tell me.

Complaint 3 - The way thee customer consultant treated me. Are these the types of employees carphone hires??

Complaint 4 - A complete lack of communication in-house causing so much of this hassle.

Complaint 5 - The lack of help know-how was willing to offer after their incompetence of almost losing my phone. What would they have really done if my phone actually went missing??

An uttermost terrible experience",0
Very pleasant and helpful- made every effort to solve my problem without making me feel stupid.,1
The transaction was very smooth. I was kept informed about delivery and time when the product would be arriving. No complaints.,1
"The order for collection was cancelled by company without consulting me. This was a birthday present for my son, 8yr old disappointed. Store had the product but wouldn't even let me have it.

"Ordered a very large screen TV in store for next day delivery. TV was delivered to my property WITHOUT a box and wet on the bottom as it had been placed on the ground outside during delivery. On further inspection the bracket housing for the TV was damaged. The delivery men stated to my son that ‚Äúit was the policy‚Äù to deliver large TV‚Äôs without packaging or a box even if I hadn‚Äôt requested it (which I hadn‚Äôt ) I have since complained to customer service, contacted them again to cancel my order, and told them to remove the TV, which they have now done.
Won‚Äôt use Curry‚Äôs again",0

So I needed a high end SACD/CD player and at first they let me take an Arcam player home for a trial which unfortunately was no better than my old player. The next player up was a Marantz 30N at considerably more expense. Callum managed to get hold of a demo player from another store and after a trial in my system they had a sale. I was going to get a brand new one but they offered me the demo player at about 20% off MRP with a full warranty. Brilliant customer service earned a sale and I am delighted with the upgraded sound in my system. Perfect retail experience.,1
"It's a shame you can't award zero stars to BT. Truly terrible service. They didn't start my BT TV service when they were supposed to. They cancelled my wife's mobile phone contract ""accidentally"" and this wasn't rectified for nearly two weeks. When it came to renewing my contracts, they didn't dispatch the order/the order failed due to faults at their end. When I called to resolve it, they refused to offer me the same price. The price had increased. The order failed to dispatch a second time. I raised a complaint and they refused to compensate me for the problems. In total, I have probably spent a full working week on the phone to BT (mostly on hold) over the last 2 years and when I raised this as an issue, I was told it wasn't their problem. I've left BT and moved to another provider. It costs me ¬£20 a month more but it's worth it not to be treated so poorly.",0
Order arrived ahead of time and in excellent condition.,1
"I ordered a Vodafone sim and received it on the 22nd of June, but the contract didn't allow me to make any international calls, (I need to use the telephone for work). On the 27th of June, I contacted customer service to cancel my contract (you have 14 days ) and they replied ""the request has been made, it takes 3-5 working days to cancel. You can dispose of the sim card.""
On Monday 28th of June, I contacted customer service again, as they haven't canceled my contract yet. Apparently, they forgot to work on my request. I'm literally stuck as I cannot contact my customers and at the same time I cannot switch to a new provider as it requires me to change my number. It's very frustrating as no one can do anything.
I asked to speak with a manager as I want this to be resolved immediately, but they just sent me the bill.",0
"Enquired about replacement remote for DVR and advised one would be delivered as we had 6 year cover on product.

"What an awful company. I placed an order almost 3 weeks but still no sign so I filled out the online form with all relevant information. I then get an email back saying they can‚Äôt deal with my enquiry as the need the information I‚Äôd just given them!!! This happened another 5 times and I gave up. I suspect they do this purposely so they don‚Äôt have to deal with complaints etc. Called them today and all my items are now either out of stock or have gone up hugely in price. Never ever again, no wonder they almost went out of business.",0
"I have broadband and TV with BT and both are unreliable - with the TV typically failing 2/3 times per week (""signal weak or lost"") and the broadband dropping out regularly. Due to this, and even though previous experience of trying to talk to someone at BT told me that trying to get them to do anything would be a painful process, I spent about an hour (70% of which involved listening to awful hold music) arranging a visit by an ""engineer"". When the guy turned up (yes, a couple of hours late), the extent of his ""engineering"" and problem solving was to make himself comfortable in my armchair (without any invitation to do so) and tell me that based on a graph on his phone, my service was fine. He then got upset when I told him that his stat's of the last X days did not mean anything as the problems that I had experienced also happened over than period - as apparently its rude to talk when an ""engineer"" is spinning a story. In summary, I struggle to see why BT allows you to waste your time booking and ""engineer"" and then waiting for them to turn up if the person clearly has no intention of doing any investigative works when they finally arrive. All told, that is about 5 hours of my life that I will not be getting back, and I have nothing other than frustration to show for it",0
Always get what I'm looking for at a reasonable price. Delivery was quick and it's easy to navigate the website.,1

"FORCED into BT when I moved into a new property that had 'full fibre' and BT were the only company in the local area that provided to my property. Ended up paying ¬£11 more than the contract I'd signed with Plusnet for this allegedly amazing, much better product.

The internet frequently disconnects when my son is playing on his XBox (three times already this morning), I have tried 2 different internet boosters at my expense and having been through BT customer services (ON THEIR PREMIUM LINE!) the only option they could provide me with was to hardwire the XBox to the router....despite them being on different floors!!! When I said they were on different floors it was reiterated that this was the only option she could see.

Tied into a contract for another 15 months but I already know I will NOT be renewing when the time comes and if it keeps disconnecting with no further help from BT I will be contacting OFCOM and seeing what avenues I can go down as at present they are failing to fulfil the contract of providing me a useable service.",0
"Easy ordering and good speedy delivery, good service all round, I would recommend them.",1
"Very bad service
Very bad customer service
They never give a solution they always promised and never do what they promised",0

"I had the AirPods max for less than three months I started to have issues with Bluetooth connectivity I brought them to the curry's aintree,Liverpool store to have them sent to apple for repair as they are under guarantee with apple they were in brand new condition as I kept them in the apple case and also had covers over the earphones to protect from damage, i was told not to include the case or covers as they would normally don't come back which baffles me, it took nearly a month to find anything out of where my repair was I was informed a couple of times that they didn't have the parts so i would have to wait, I did not hear anything for another two weeks so I went to the store to get some sort of update as had no contact to which I was told after 30 days I would receive a replacement pair ironically that day I received a message stating they have sent back to the store not repaired with a explanatory note, I then returned to the store I was served and was told that they had replaced the headphones so I left the store and checked the headphones in the car in the car park of the store to find they had not replaced and have sent them back stating to my shock they are water damaged absolutely untrue and to my own research have found out these headphones suffer from condensation build up as they are made from metal and poor design. They also have deep scratches on them which were not there as they were less than 3 months old and protected and the ear cups which are ¬£75 are missing. The manager at the time seen all the damage and can confirm but would contact me within 48hrs which has past I have heard nothing since. I have been left with to be honest ¬£550 headphones worthless which would leave me to seek legal action as no care was taken with the so called ""repair‚Äù from apple. I have been contacted by team know how on there feedback on experience even then I heard nothing back, appalling service and company I will be seeking legal action against them.",0
"Great service, very quick delivery",1
"We have had MONTHS of Internet drop out from Virgin Media, unable to work efficiently from home. So we decided to buy ourselves out of the broadband contract and go full fibre with BT which is FABULOUS! Same price as well. Three people work from home and we have no lag or disconnection anywhere in the house unlike Virgin Media which was like going back to dial up in the early 90's. Worst thing was when my husband rang to cancel the contract, the Virgin Media agent just kept babbling on about sending out an engineer. THREE times after being told we had moved to BT, we were kept waiting with long silences (must have been their crappy virgin broadband connection cutting out), she came back with ignoring my husband's request to end contract and kept going on about sending an engineer!!!! which would be pointless as we told her we were now connected to BT THREE TIMES. So I grabbed the phone and said ""LISTEN to the customer, customers are what keep YOU in a job""....to which I heard laughter....ignorant and ill-mannered doesn't cut it. Businesses would do well to realise that they ONLY survive if the people working for them carry out the jobs well and the customers are happy with the service. They can easily be knocked off their high and mighty pedestals! Don't put up with shoddy service and being walked over!",0
I got the parcel very quickly so dotty I had to send it but the staff were very helpful,1
Huge let down with bt services still trying to get my money back after 28 day still no joy,0
Excellent service and fabulous product thank you,1
"I had a Tracker fitted in December 2021. I found out by chance the Tracker was not tracking my vehicle until July 2022.
I contacted Vodafone in November 2022 to renew my subscription. The Vodafone operator blamed a partner business, Hyde Park Corner LTD, for the error. After speaking to both Vodafone and HPC about the matter, it turns out Vodafone contacted HPC in March 2022 to rectify the problem, and it took until July for HPC to contact Vodafone for the subscription to commence.
It was refreshing that both Vodafone and Hyde Park Corner Ltd were open and honest about what had happened.
I feel fortunate my car was not stolen during this seven month period, as my insurance states I must have a tracker fitted and working.
I'm posting this review hoping that it reaches other customers of these two businesses detailing my experience. There are other customers out there who will be unaware the Tracker they had fitted was not commissioned correctly. My advice is check the date your tracker subscription commenced. If it is later than the installation date then you have also been exposed to the invalidated insurance like myself.
Vodafone and Hyde Park Corner Ltd now say this problem has been rectified, and I can verify my Tracker now works correctly. My mistake was not to test the Tracker worked on installation, and trusting the two businesses involved to provide the service I had subscribed to.",0

"I have been sent in circles with this one. On the 1st of January I was given a quote for my old phone worth ¬£110. It wasn't until the 12th of January I received the packaging to send my phone off to Carphone Warehouse, however I did this immediately. It has been 10 days since the quote expired, they have received the phone and are still yet to pay me. I have spoken to customer services numerous times and they have assured me that the quote will be honoured due to the postal strikes. Today I received an email from the trade in team, saying that they have revised the value of my phone and are only willing to offer ¬£55. So according to them they have halved the value of the phone due to the quote expiring. I have asked numerous times to speak to a manager on the phone and they have refused to do so stating that ""the systems are down"" and the managers ""are available but unavailable"". The customer service is absolutely shocking and in the current climate with the cost of living crisis, selling an old phone can be a big help. They are taking advantage of their poor policies and regulations. I am still battling to either get the original amount or have my device sent back to me. Please do not use this company, I can't stress that enough. They can not be trusted.",0
"Been with BT for a very long time, service from their EE mobile all the way to broadband and tv is excellent, I definitely 100% recommend.",1

Don‚Äôt ever get anything from Three. Last month i took a phone on contract with them and they had the audacity to send me a refurbished one after i confronted them about it they told me to send it back to them and they will cancel the contract i did as they said but over the next 3 weeks i kept asking them why the contract hasn‚Äôt been cancelled yet aswell as the direct debit they kept telling me that they will take both of them down in the next 24 hours until the direct debit date came and they took my money.,0

The process from booking a repair to the repair guy coming out and inevitably the vouchers being sent to me was extremely efficient. Booking a repair was very straight forward and easy. One thing need to sort is the contact us page on the app does not work and it is impossible to contact the repair team by phone. There was slight confusion with the dates of the repair with the e ternal repair company but Luckily the service was good enough I never needed to contact in the end.,1

"Just been stuck behind a delivery truck (number plate ended in DLD) for fifteen minutes whilst the two guys casually went about delivering a fridge freezer. I wouldn't mind this normally. They have a job to do and had to clog up the one way road in order to complete that job. What annoyed me was that there were three cars waiting to go by, and there was not one look of acknowledgement from the van crew, not a wave, a quick word to say how long they'd be- they just acted as if there was all the time in the world. Then only because the owner of the house said they had better move, they decided to go, again, without acknowledgement of the fact that three families had waited 15 minutes, and just drove off. A few common courtesies wouldn't go amiss. A training need here I think!!",0

"I am so sick of 3 that I feel like crying. I had a bill for ¬£93. My contract is for ¬£10.00 p.c.m. unlimited. When I queried it oh it is because you called directory enquiries hence ¬£26.00 for that 40 second call. . No i didn't. The number I called was my accountant. Oh it must be a premium number. No, it isn't, it is a landline number. ""you must have called the number via directory enquiries"" Why would I do that when I've been with the same accountant for 5 years and have his number logged in my phone. If I was to explain everything here about 3 I would need an A4 size paper. They are absolutely appalling. They cannot even update my address even though I've told them umpteen times that it is not my accountants address but my home address. I couldn't call my son yesterday who also has an account with 3 because apparently of my spend on my account. It has taken me at least a dozen calls when I initially set up a 3 business account a few months ago and have had nothing but problems ever since. One of my sons left 3 a year ago because they ripped him off and it seems they are now doing the same to me. I am gobsmacked at the appalling service. 3 you are loosing a customer soon, ME! You know who I am as I've spoken to you twice today and once last week and many many times before. UPDATE; Had a reply from Ankita in response to my review of yesterday. I entered the link she gave me which went to 3 live chat. After spending 3 hours on the phone today I didn't hold my breath that the live chat guy will be any more helpful than 3 staff from various departments on the phone. I was right. Glasgow office told me I have a personal account with them not business so they put me through to India for a PAC code. A lady in India put me through to Adam also in India. Adam told me I am not a customer of 3 and that I have left them in April 2022 so he cannot give me a PAC code. Here we go again, yet another call. Glasgow answered when every time you have to go through security questions only to be put through to Ireland. Emily cannot give me a PAC code either as my account is open and my account is under investigation. The issue was reported a week ago and it's still under investigation. According to Adam in India I am not even a customer of 3. And now in response to Ankita's reply to my complaint she gives me a link to live chat and lo and behold they cannot help because they cannot access an account with with my mobile number. I do not exist. To some departments I do not exist, whereas others are saying I am a personal customer and some say a business customer but nobody wants to give me a PAC code. I have wasted 4 hours today of my time and haven't got anywhere with anybody in 3 various departments and yet they will be charging me ¬£93.04 next week. If I cancel the DD my credit score will be affected. I am reporting this to rip-off Britain and will be contacting Which legal team. Ankita don't bother sending me links which are totally useless and do not tell me I used directory enquiries or a premium number. It was my accountants landline no., how many times do I need to repeat myself? p.s. 3 have been charging me each time I called my son and his wife who are also with 3. Appalling abysmal pathetic service. They just don't know what the left hand is doing from the right hand. I have recommended that one of my sons leaves 3 who has been with them for 20 years and who was just about to change to a business account. After seeing the problems I've had I am sure he will take my advice.",0

"Absolutely appalling experience! Ordered a washing machine from them on 28th May for delivery and installation. They delivered it 15 days later and as soon as we turned it on, the drum won't spin. Called up the installing team but they didn't pick up. I then called up customer service and after 5-6 phones calls (they made me shuttle between manufacturer and their own customer desk for a uplift number) explaining the issue, they gave me a date 3 days later for delivery. Guys come down with a delivery and tell us that they are only for collection & delivery - not for installation. They were booked incorrectly. We are booked again and given a date 15 days later with no access to washing machine of course. We receive a text a day before that the machine will be delivered next day between 2pm to 6pm (on 2nd July '21). No one calls & no one turns up. I call up customer service again and told once again that they booked us wrong. They booked us for service. Now, we are being given a new booking reference of 4 days later. Steer clear of them! This is the worst experience and customer service I had ever to deal with. Going by rating here, I am not sure if they are keen to improve.",0

After replying to say I would like a new set, I had to call again- 5 days later- to ask for an update. The girl, said she would email me a postage label right away so I wrapped up the parcel to return.

"This review in regards to EE but BT are joint company so it's show to all Nar customers how bad the company gaint have treated me shocking

Dear both parties in this email senior management of EE plus BT .

First of l my please accept my apologies for emailing when you're staff can't do there jobs correct and now given on being in hold Nd trying to sort this out .

Time line leading up to making this formal complaint today with CEO for both EE and BT .

Yesterday being 23 July 21 phoned up EE sales and got to speak with someone in Wales contact centre I explored my offers and what's sort of plans I would be looking etc .

I had to provide card information and direct debit information which is pretty much standard .

The account was accepted with an upfront of ¬£100.00 refund in 6 months approximately I believe.

Then went on delivery which I was told ¬£9.98 for Saturday I object to paying this amount because of my commitment Monday to Friday.

One of the opportunity was to go in to store this has caused problems which I moved on to in this complex email later on .

After leaving the call with sales I phoned customer service for EE an spoken with someone who I didn't provide me is name he also didn't record my account because I didn't give or he asked for information for the account.

Some of agents comments were not acceptable too .

He also said about the 6.98 charge for Monday to Friday by dpd which the sales agent didn't talk about at all .

I then phoned back again again and asked to raise a formal complaint I got in touch with Ireland's call centre she advised me approximately 2 hours this never happened at all .

This morning I phoned my local EE store couldn't get in touch at all this was also to find what's information I need also if phones available.

I couldn't reach the store .

When I went in to the store today at Stockport waste of my time saying I need photos I'd of which the ones they require I don't have at all .

EE should of advice me correct and I wouldn't of wasted my time at all .

This evening I phoned up about this spoken to Kelly I believe in Ireland she went to review phone call never came back so I ended the call.

This my reason for emailing you both .

Please can you acknowledge this formal email and get someone to reach out to me .

I do look forward to hearing from someone soon .

Also thanks for giving me the great experience I an sure you're happy with what they given me .",0

"They delayed my repaired Laptop delivery an extra week, all the while assuring me it'd ""arrive tomorrow"" or similar on most of the prior days up to the Friday it was actually delivered.

They give me a specific (yet quite wide) delivery window for the Monday to make sure to wait for the delivery, and nobody even shows up.

Then told it'll be delivered the Wednesday morning and absolutely nothing. Website updates to Friday delivery and at this point I'm not willing to waste even more time talking to people who seem to enjoy sending you back and forth between their various departments.

Customer service hangs up on me multiple times during all of this when I'm trying to find out where my missing laptop is, especially when they can't figure out what to do.

Now I'm being completely ignored by their complaints department through Twitter. Radio silence. Any time I get any progress on the phone, they hang up. The quality of their phone lines is also atrocious, which seems to be by design to make the experience of getting any help as difficult as possible.

Their complaints form online is non-functioning. They've kept me away from work for 4 extra days than they initially mentioned, which I'm now going to start the process of claiming for.

The kicker? The repair they've carried out has now yielded completely different and unrelated issues, they didn't even seal the laptop up properly! The rubber on the outside is peeling off, such a simple thing to get right which was ignored which can only speak to me on the quality of the repair done.

Going to have to go through all of this all over again for the new issues. Absolute joke service, steer well clear and never use, my mental state is remarkably worse off as a result of having to deal with these people, it's like they enjoy stressing out and ridiculing their customers for sport!

I don't like putting negative things out into the world but the contempt I've been treated with by your staff is remarkable, especially considering how polite I've been throughout this whole process. I make a point of never being rude to retail or phone staff, they're just doing their best to do what can be a difficult job, I've been there myself, but the unwarranted rudeness I've received makes me rethink my philosophy entirely...

Not about to let these people walk all over me again. Go to any other shop. John Lewis, Amazon, even a car boot would probably give you better aftercare.

Judging by the amount of similar low quality reviews this is a company-wide issue, so I will be pitching this as a news story to some of the national newspapers, evidently KnowHow think they can get away with walking all over their paying customers but real journalism is all about holding people like this to account.

Really not looking forward to getting a response saying ""We're sorry our service is awful, feel free to go ahead and call us on the service you've just been complaining about"".

If KnowHow can actually offer a solution to my issue (a courtesy laptop to use while they fix this one again) it'd do something to restore some goodwill but I'm not hopeful, I'm expecting someone from Knowhow to comment below asking me to get in touch through their redundant phone line or their social media who are ignoring me.

If I get a response along these lines-

""Hi Akash, I'm very sorry to hear of the issues you have experienced when contacting our customer service team. Should support still be required at this time then please do get in further contact over the phone or via social media and we will be with you as soon as we possibly can to help. Thanks""

-then it'll be evident that this company isn't interested in making things right, but just saving face.

Will be updating this review with everything that happens from here on out, and if anybody would like to get in touch with similar experiences to report as a part of this story then please do.


To update, this was never resolved and the Laptop is out of the coverage period as of April, so I'm stuck with all the new issues from their last repair attempt.

Can't say I'll ever buy anything from these stores again after all of this, I will happily go out of my way to recommend people against taking any kind of plan with Knowhow or shopping at their affiliated stores.",0

I asked to speak to the manager and what she said to me that the earliest I can use my phone again is on the 21st July.

"worst experience ever will never use them again.



1 item was missing from the order, and the gaming chair that did come was covered in Mold.

Called up for customer services adviser to claim she is going to help me, and I would just need to send a picture of the box and gaming chair.

After waiting a week still no reply, so I email her, 2 days later still no reply so I call up again.
Another agent said they will email us and ask her to contact me.
Waited another few days so no reply, called up again another agent took over the case and helped me order a pickup for the Mold covered gaming chair and help put a replacement for the missing item.

They messed up the collection date for the chair, so I took a day off work for no collection to be done, I had to call up again to rearrange another collection.

finally got the chair collected, I had to then wait another 1.5 weeks for them to get the chair before sending me a new one. New chair finally came (I had to take another day off work) for the replacement to be then coved in Mold as well.

I had to then arrange another collection for a refund. They once again messed up the collection date another wasted day off work. Then had to call up to sort another collection date.
Once the chair was finally taken. I waited 2 weeks still no refund, I had to call up once again for them to see their collection company can't locate the chair and I would have to wait another week.

Called up a week later for them to finally refund the chair



In the end it took 2 months from the delivery date to get all the issue sorted before they could refund.

delivery date 14/11/2022
Date I got refund 09/01/2023

"They don't have the 'Knowhow' - or just don't care !

I paid to have my laptop returned and a fault investigated.
Over the last 10 days I have spoken to many staff and spent many hours of my life on hold - frankly I don't have the time to be on hold for 40mins + waiting for Knowhow to answer. (Even when they text me asking that I call a specific number as they ""want to talk to me"" - I call over 20 times but they don't answer and the line cuts off after several minutes ringing out !!)
I do hope somebody within the senior management of the company cares about profits we customers putting in their pockets - if not customers will find products and services elsewhere !!

Life is too short - don't even contemplate trying to contact them - please !

Prior to the response from Knowhow, they have sent me 4 separate text messages telling me they will deliver my Laptop 'between 07.15 - 11.15 last Monday - needless to say, despite being up early an waiting all day, nothing has turned up.

"Where do I start....
I was without Internet for over 3 weeks, I work from home so Internet connection that works is extremely important.
They said they would send out an EE hub as the promise to keep you connected the following day after I'd replied to their text messages offering assistance and that someone would call me, they never did. I called them and they confirmed I needed an engineer but they couldn't access the appointments at that moment, and that they would arrange and come back to me... this never happened. I never received the hub as promised the following day, I had to call again and they confirmed no hub was sent as they only send when an appointment is made. They then confirmed no appointments were available for two weeks!! Reluctantly agreed as well I need it sorted, the hub did arrive 2 days later and was less than useless... could not use this for work or to stream anything on the TV!
Had someone from BT come to the door to explain that there was a major issue in the area and they had all engineers working on the issue and hoped it would be sorted that day... that did not happen and the day the engineer was due to come they called to say that they were not coming as it needed an open reach engineer and that would happen 2 days later.
The engineer never turned up!
I had to call BT again, the hold times are horrific! Eventually did get through to a very helpful person who sent an engineer the following day and after a phone call it was all up and running... a phone call!!! It is shocking how terrible BT are!
I wanted to leave BT but after arranging a new connecting with an alternative provider at a much competitive price and a faster speed but when they tried to connect us, there is only one port available which means I can only have terrible Internet which doesn't cover the whole of my house with BT, I've tried raising a complaint but it's been over a week without a response! I think I just need to go directly to the ombudsman now.",0

"Terrible customer service. After being passed to many customer service departments it's taken 3 weeks to resolve a phone number & data issue on a new contract.
In this time it has cost me an extra months rental on my previous contract phone & 4-5 hrs in wasted time telling the same story to try & get this sorted.
I'm sure the customer care teams are reading off the same card when they apologise for the inconvenience it has caused.
The connection team promise to get back to you but again had to call several times to sort this.
Think before you use CPW.",0

Today i have shown them proof that the money has left my bank but they are denying knowledge that they have received it and gone to cutting off my services due to non payment.
What more proof do you people need? I don't do direct debit because you lot take it as and when you want not on the date it states, even if the date falls on a weekend you are meant to take it on the Friday...that's never the case!!!

"Received an email from Team Knowhow stating my subcription to their cloud was up for renewal. States on their website if you do not want to renew you have to phone them. 28 minutes later I spoke with one of their representatives and explained i didn't want to renew. He said he didn't have the option to stop the renewal but I could cancel the contract today. I said there's a big difference between cancelling a contract and not renewing one, he stated this was the only option I had. So basically if I didn't cancel today I would have to phone again on the 1st February, as renewal was on the 2nd Feb and cancel it then! To be honest I cancelled it then, don't trust them not to take the money out early. What a joke and a waste of customers time.",0

"Had a sim only 12 month plan which was setup in a Vodafone store by Vodafone staff. I had my daughters phone added to the plan... It took the staff in the Vodafone store 2 hours! to completed this on their in store systems. I was told everything had been setup and that a monthly direct debit would automatically come out for both sim plans. After 3 months I get a letter saying that I'm in arrears and will be changed to pay as you go unless the arrears are cleared. I login to the rubbish vodafone web portal and see that my daughters DD is not being paid. So I pay the outstanding balance. The very next week my number is changed to Pay as you go! even though I cleared the arrears (which was not my fault, the Vodafone staff in the store should have sorted this out!). Call customers service (after navigating 10 mins of 'who do you want to talk to?' automated questions). And get blame for not paying my bill! the only thing they can do is move me back to sim only plan which is a new 12 month contract...

"I contacted carphone warehouse as i wished for my account to be closed down and wiped from the database plus to put an end to the marketing emails im still recieving.

My contract was bought out in march 2020 due to covid 19 and my new supplier took over everything however as its due to end the emails are still coming to my email address.

I spoke to one sales advisor and he sent a message across to customer services, placed in a queue and was informed of wait times.

The customer service advisor couldnt pick my name up properly or read the message that was sent to her. I had to re explain these details several times and still no further forward!!

Since her incompetence filled me with anxiety at the fact that two simple, queries can be actioned, i asked to speak to her supervisor or line manager. I was then put on hold for a further ten minutes and an automated message came through to discuss repairs!!

So i called the customer service number again..... I spoke to another sales advisor thankfully he helped me out due to his ten year experience of being an advisor although he was still unsure of a few questions i wanted answered. I was then made aware that customer services is in south africa!!! Not even in the uk!!!! So baring in mind these questions i had were to do with uk gdpr rules and regulations she wouldnt have a clue anyways!!! All she could say was go online and do it yourself.... How can i when these are queries for you to do as you have the systems to make the changes happen but nope!!!

Thankfully im no longer a customer of carphone warehouse however basic customer service cannot be handled and objectioned handled properly!!!

Avoid at all costs!!!",0

I've never had any issues previously so this is a shame but will avoid using them in the future if this is how they deal with returns. They can't even tell me how much the refund amount is so I don't even know how much I'm entitled to. I'll probably log a complaint on Monday and take it to the ombudsman if necessary.

Spent two hours trying to tell them I wanted to disconnect, they eventually accepted this.

One month later, no action, they said they had no proof of call. I sent them the log of the whatsapp conversation. They kept responding without reading it.

Then they phone to discuss the complaint with no knowledge of the complaint, no access to the emails, no clue whatsoever. Try and fob me off with incorrect information.

In response to Virgin's reply, you phoned me about the complaint without even reading it first and then took a while to understand the issue even though it was all covered in the emails. Guess a customer's time is not important to you!",0

I have now decided to raise a disputed payment claim with my card provider as I have no faith in this company Wish me luck in getting my money.
Success!!!! After going to the Small Claims Court they paid up.
I also took a number of other measures but I put getting my money back down to the Small Claims Court. It is an easy process all on line and very quick.

I guess that the return label would enable me to do this anyway, but I don't want to cause a wasted journey for my very reliable local Evri agent. Is there any reason for the change of options?",1

What should have been a simple process has turned into a complete nightmare. Washing machine stopped working 3 weeks ago and an engineer come out to do a write off. Waited for a voucher that arrived after having to chase up for it. I had my machine for over 10 years with the care plan so must have paid ¬£100‚Äôs since then. Machines value was under valued so disputed this. Was told someone would contact me but never did. Waited a week and finally agreed that I would get an additional voucher to cover my installation and recycling. Been another week and have been chasing them and keep getting told 24hours. Wanted to make a complaint yesterday and again told that they are too busy to take my complaint and someone will contact me in 24hours. This is a joke I must have called them countless amount of times and there seems to be no customer care or urgency to help their customers properly. I have taken coverplans on all my appliances and this is the last time I do this. I have never been at the receiving end of such bad service and been left with a broken washing machine for 3weeks due to a voucher not being issued. Really poor and unacceptable!!!,0

Constantly chasing them. Nobody would have told me an engineer wasn't going to arrive unless I hassled them again. Speaking with a ""robot"" on live chat. Total and utter waste of time, money and effort.",0

Any concerns raised to the customer service never closed. The customer service team lack experience to address issues. These includes simply enabling the online account access - which hadn't been addressed since the contract. There are a number of issues pending over many months and cancelling the contract is not easy either,0
"1 star is too much. I've been with BT for many years and encountered many problems. Why i'm still with them? I dont know to be honest. From what I understand all these suppliers are as bad as one another. And ultimately BT own all the lines anyway. Still, I should have left years ago.
My story is so long winded there isn't even enough character space here to list every issue i've had with customer services and the general service quality of their internet over the years. I had typed it out and run out of space to finish.
In short, I had some disconnection issues most saturdays (my peak use times) between 10am-3pm AFTER my contract ended in Dec 21. Not one time in contract over the 24 months did it happen. Coincidence? You decide. Apparently they narrowed the fault to the hub after an engineer tested the line into the property. Problem persists so I contact BT again. They suggest replacing the hub or enter a new deal which will replace the hub anyway and fix the fault. No good enough deals offered so I leave it and look at other suppliers offering the same service for almost half what i'm paying BT. Later did some haggling and agreed a deal (after being told im on their best price previously, it's all lies) substantially cheaper per month with the same speeds. All of a sudden all my fault cases in My BT section had been resolved/closed by customer services stating that I had told them it was fixed. No I didn't. Why would I tell BT its been fixed while i'm sitting looking at my hub light up like a xmas tree turning itself on and off, disconnecting me from internet use? I'm still clueless as to what the actual problem is but yet the issues have disappeared since I agreed to a new deal? Was there an issue or was it because they wanted me in a new deal? Again, make up your own mind. Anyway, my new deal started today and no new hub has arrived so I contact customer service to see when I can expect to see it, only to be told no hub is being sent with your new deal. Excuse me? That was PART of my deal! Part of fixing the fault I have. But no fault, no hub required right? Miraculously, My OLD hub now has no issues since I agreed to a new deal. How convenient! Is it a coincidence? Again, i'll leave that for you to decide. I was told an engineer was visiting the exchange and an agent booked an appointment for that. As soon as my new deal was agreed that appointment was cancelled and when I queried it, I was blamed for cancelling it. Why would I cancel and engineer going to the exchange while the fault still existed? Here is another for you. On live chat I was informed my complaint case had been closed also. Who closed it? BT. Nothing has been resolved, nobody has been in contact with me even though I was sent an email stating someone would be in contact within 48 hours. 4 days on, nothing. This same advisor encouraged me to be passed to her manager. I had run out of time to chat and asked if someone could call me to which I was told - we will only be able to call you if you speak to my manager. That to me sounded like blackmail. Absolute rubbish. If it can be done after I speak with them on live chat, it can be done before. I cannot believe I was expected to believe this nonsense. All lies. I feel so stupid having put the slightest trust in BT to begin with as I was 75% out the door to another supplier before I was offered their best deal. Further to that, I always request the transcript for these live chats are sent to me, i've never received 1. Something to hide BT? Promising the world and not delivering so hide the evidence? Its ok, I've taken screen shots of everything your lying agents said when signing me up to a new deal. Especially about a new hub. It was a promise!!! (Their exact words) hahaha how i've been fooled. Shows not to trust any of their customer service agents. I wish I could post the screenshot here for everyone to see.

IF YOU ARE FROM BT READING THIS, do not even bother to tell me to get in touch with your team on social media as you've done with others, I can't get any sense from people who are in customer service as it is. You want this resolved, you contact me. Preferably someone with a track record of honesty. This is your problem being made to be mine. I've been chasing you lot around for weeks and got absolutely nowhere other than to be lied to. You really think i'm going to chase you anymore? Absolutely not. If I dont have my hub within this week, i'll be taking advantage of my 14 day cooling off period and cancelling the order. Never in my life as a consumer have I been tempted to go seek consumer advice. I'd really be interested to gather more information to backup my case here. Empty promises, lies, manipulation, greed. What more reason do you need to stay away from BT. 88% 1 star reviews out of 10500 people tells me enough. Then there are the disgruntled people who didn't leave a review. Overall, I think the company is a mess.",0

Many times the network status symbol showed good coverage even some times with 5G, and when I tried to connect to the internet it just kept waiting waiting then dropped off. The worst experience was when I was using it for some banking matters that got timed out! Too bad I have a contract for two years and I wonder if there's a way to discontinue and switch to another better network!",0
"I have had TalkTalk Fibre 900 for a few months now. Zero issues with the broadband itself, but the customer service... ooft. I have had to call TalkTalk literally every month since signing up with them.
1. TalkTalk didn't set up my direct debit on account creation, resulting in money not being taken on the agreed bill payment date. This resulted in a late payment charge on my account. I called to have this removed and the direct debit activated.
2. Received an email from TalkTalk stating that an engineer would be arriving to set up my internet... as I had already been using TalkTalk internet for over a month this was somewhat confusing, so I called and was assured this was just an email sent out in error.
3. Received two Eeros in the mail a few weeks later! I called again to discover an additional account had been set up for me, including an additional monthly fee. I was put through to cancellations to cancel the newer account.
4. Newer account wasn't cancelled. Original account was cancelled. It's important to note here that the original account was set up at a nice introductory rate, while the newer account (set up by TalkTalk in error) had no discounts applied. Of course, it's the original discounted account that was cancelled! So, I received a bill for the second account and called them to rectify. Unfortunately, I was told TalkTalk's computer systems were down that day, so they couldn't amend the account. They discounted the bill to the original price but advised that the next bill I received would be at the higher price and I would have to call to rectify this again. I was told an 'escalation' had been raised to ensure this issue was dealt with promptly. I did not hear from TalkTalk until the next bill was generated.
5. Bill arrives the following month at the higher price as expected. Called TalkTalk, and the call centre worker read through the notes and immediately discounted the bill to the original price (I have never paid the higher amount; TalkTalk have always rectified each individual bill when I call). I asked them to rectify the account details to ensure I was billed at the correct price in future. I was told it was not possible to amend the account as it was less than 90 days old. I have been with TalkTalk for more than 90 days; it's this new and erroneous account that's less than 90 days old. I asked them to override it as it's a TalkTalk error. She didn't have the authorisation. Said I would have to call back next month. Again.

I asked to be put through to cancellations. At this point I'm just tired of having to call every month. Cancellations were happy to cancel my account but informed me of a potential early cancellation charge that may apply. I asked that this be removed considering the circumstances. He said he couldn't, he couldn't even give me a final bill amount or date, or even an exact date that my service would end and just said that I would have to call back when my bill arrived next month. Seriously?! Why do this company want to speak to me so badly every month?!
I told him not to cancel yet and asked him to put me through to someone with the authority to tell me what my final bill would be and to remove any cancellation charges. He put me through to someone who hung up on me (I do believe this was accidental though).
6. Called back immediately and spoke to a very nice woman who convinced me to let her try one more thing before cancelling: she has raised an escalation and has assured me someone will contact me within 3-5 working days with a resolution. I'll believe it when it happens.
In the meantime, I'm looking at other broadband providers so I'm ready to activate when TalkTalk inevitably do nothing, and I have to call the again next month.

Highly highly recommend that anyone reading this stay away from this company.",0
"I wanted to change this phone which I bought 2 days ago, to buy expensive one bigger from Argos. Never used phone with all stickers tags in place at Luton Sainsbury's . They refused to return. Which was a shame when Argos says return s are accepted and everything was according to their returs policy. They should remove from website that once bought, cannot be changed or returned. I was buying every little thing I needed only from argos. I felt heart broken. Will never buy anything from Argos.",0

"as a user I found Bark is easy to post jobs and seek for professional, however, the interface let all traders can see my phone number is disturbing. My house need full refurb therefore I searched for traders in mybuilders.com and bark , i did met more then 20 traders most from thebuilders.com and the experience is bark got more cowboy traders, many of them only got few reviews even they got 4-5 stars but experienced of working/quotation with them are unpleasanted, some of them took a job and keep delaying to show up for the job which caused lots of issues. On the contrary, thebuilders.com can get more professional in standard and they never show your phone number to traders until your approaval.

*** Updated on 30-Dec 2022: Don't go to Barks for traders as lots of scams and under standard traders, I found one roofer to fix some urgent issues, the problem occurs again after 2 months 'fixing"" . I want to leave bad comments but found the trader already disappeared in barks. I wonder if there's any selection /qualification need to provided for traders to open barks account. Customers without any protection at all. I will NEVER use Barks to find traders!!",0
on my account was offered free passes i did take up offers then cancel before the end of date have email confirming had been cancelled. they take money out of my bank account charding me for the passes!! when go to online chat told they hadn't taken any money out of my bank account just be careful check your bank statement,0

"Vodafone appears to hold their paying customers with nothing short of contempt.

the delivery was much better than i expected as i had read reviews that some people didn't receive their order.

"I ordered a new, high-end PC from PCSpecialist a couple weeks ago and was super impressed with how quickly it was built and shipped. I paid slightly extra for it to be shipped within 5 working days, ordered it on a Friday, and even with a bank holiday following the weekend, it had arrived by Wednesday.

The PC itself was exactly what I had ordered, very well put together with excellent cable management. One of the smaller case fans wasn't fully connected to the motherboard so wouldn't turn on at first (easily fixed, probably could have been slightly dislodged while shipping and really not an issue). PCSpecialist runs each new build through a quality control process to ensure they work as expected, so I haven't been concerned at any stage of the build.

PCSpecialist gives different options to pay, one of which involves splitting the cost of the device, paying a deposit, and if the rest gets paid back within 12 months you only pay a ¬£29 fee (which is a lot better compared to interest/paying back monthly!) - I highly recommend this for people who require that extra flexibility.

Obviously the PC is still relatively new, parts have yet to fail (though I wouldn't expect them to!) so I haven't required any customer support service yet. I'll update this review if it's necessary, but I doubt it will be. Good stuff!",1
Great game choice. And fast delivery,1
Very poor customer service. Trying to get answers and the call centre staff were incompetent. They have a script. At one point asking me for my partners phone number for id. Partner responded but they would only accept it if I said it (ludicrous do i have to repeat it)! This is before the substantive issues of no bills and wrong tariff. Nightmare getting anywhere.,0
Professional as always. Curtis steered us through the maze of LED OLED Q-OLED etc. and helped us choose the perfect TV within our budget.,1

"Worst experience

My boyfriend called for the third time to ask why our download speed is so low and it‚Äôs not the same like in the contract. That guy started to raised his voice saying that he doesn‚Äôt have anything in the history about this, in the time that my boyfriend said that being calm. And after checking the download speed on the phone was bad and on the PC was good but when you started to download a game it‚Äôs not that speed even if is no one connected on the internet. And the computer with internet is connected by wire. That guy started to say that is because for example the Steam has to many people downloading the same game in the same time (something that it‚Äôs not true, is not like those are connected on our broadband) or the computer it‚Äôs bad.
The result: no answer why is so low and he hang up. I am changing the internet from BT. If I have to call so many times and still the problem is not fixed it‚Äôs not worth paying the money.",0

"If I could give no stars I would!!!

Order number: MPD101221681

I made the order first week January.

I did not receive my order for 2 weeks and was told to be patient there‚Äôs delays. Clearly after 2 weeks when something is meant to be next day delivery there‚Äôs something wrong.

They refused to send me a new device. I asked for a refund and they are telling me I have to wait 7 days for this to be processed. It‚Äôs been 21 days.

No refund and no have the mobile network taking ¬£67 for my account.

Customer service is horrendous telling to simply just wait for the refund. WHEN I HAVE BEEN WAITING DOR NEARLY 1 MONTH.

I did not receive the other and therefore have nothing to return. For all I know the order was not even sent out. If the delivery company has lost my order that is not an issue on my side.

Waiting for my over ¬£200 refund.

Discussing company, surely you have insurance to account for these situations.

Again I did not receive the order.

Avoid them at all cost.

"Absolute Clowns - You couldnt make it up

Back in May i left a review - copied below which includes my BT complaint number..

Disgusting jokers who just want to feed the coffers.

No WiFi for months so call customer services who promise to send a tech out.
No tech and they close my complaint.

I‚Äôm left paying for wifi I haven‚Äôt got so ask them after numerous texts and 2.5 hours on the phone to shut my account.

They‚Äôre very happy to close my account and instead of reimbursing at least three payments want to charge me a fee to settle the account

Robbing scumbags who should be wearing a mask

Just to waste my time further, here‚Äôs the complaint number and you know where you can shove it


Diabolical, disgusting service and no attempt to reimburse just quick to mention further charges to close an account for a service I‚Äôm not receiving.

So today 22nd August

I recieve a letter stating
"" You stopped your service on 11th August"" demanding ¬£88.21 as a final bill

"I moved home, did everything online and got my go live date. Annoying that it takes 2 weeks in this day and age but waited patiently. On the go live day, I receive an email after 6pm stating my order had been cancelled. Tried to call this telecommunication company but no customer service available after 7pm. I spend hours on a Saturday talking to Sean from Cs. I ask him... ""if I continue with TalkTalk and wait a further two weeks for this new date, what assurances can you give me that this won't happen again?"" he said "" I see my cases from beginning to end and I have sorted it, sit back relax. I have sent you paperwork"".
12 days later (2 dayd shy of going live) ... TalkTalk call... Your order is cancelled but we'll give you a discount and next available date to go live is in 2 weeks. I ask to speak to supervisor. Christopher (the supervisor) comes on. Tells me I should have gone online to check it was all okay. I said I have no access to your systems to do that besides I was assured it was in hand. He tells me that if I open a bank account... Do I not check it? I hang up at this point but Christopher phones back somewhat irate . He's not done telling me I could have checked everything on the TalkTalk app. That evening I signed up for bt broadband. Still not online almost two months into my move but BT hasn't cancelled on me... yet. Any way, talk talk sent me a text saying I would receive ¬£5.25 of my next bill as an apology for failure. They have the cheek to bill me...are they going to me back my money for almost 2 months of Netflix, Prime and other online services I've paid for and unable to watch? For the days I've had to buy hotspot wifi to do my work? The audacity of even considering sending me a bill.",0

"Well what can I say?! If it hadn't of been for my mum, Studio would have completely ruined my Christmas. Be aware, they will close your account down and deem it inactive if you do not order anything withing 12 months. It was made inactive without any warning, and didn't even have the common decency to email me asking if I would still like to keep my account open. Yet other people I know, were asked after 6 months. I was told I would have to create a new account, which would have had a starting credit limit of ¬£100, rather than the ¬£1950 limit I'd accumulated. So still wouldn't have been able to order what i wanted. I only ever use it at Christmas, as its easier to pay through the year, rather than worrying about paying for everything in cash at once.

"The first text I received said we would have WiFi from the 15th September. I rang and said this is not good enough as we have given notice and require WiFi for work.

The 5th comes around and still no WiFi by late afternoon, i then ring again to see what the problem is to be told that there was a fault that would be sorted on the 6th/7th September. I then wait again to reach the late evening on 7th with still no WiFi. When I ring for the 3rd time I‚Äôm told that there has been an issue which is currently being resolved by open reach and should be completed within the next 24/48hours very annoyed but just happy it‚Äôs being sorted I end the call and start the waiting game again.

I ring again to be told the 15th it will be live, as you can tell how this is going the 15th came still no WiFi but I did receive a email that evening of the 16th saying it‚Äôs live this gave me some joy but then to walk to my talktalk box and it‚Äôs flashing amber with still no WiFi.

I changed banks and added my new card but 2 months running this awful company didn't take the money and cut off the phone and broadband. I had to stand in the snow for 40 minutes as no mobile reception in my house to get reconnected. If to want hassle and heartache then use them.,0
The engineer was friendly and knowledgeable,1
"I placed an order for a new contract deal where I get ¬£365 back for my old phone. They promise a next day refund. I returned the phone in their packaging special delivery to ensure it arrived quickly and safe at my own cost. The phone was and I hope is still like brand new in full working condition. However, 4 days after they received my phone I decided to chase up as I had heard nothing back from them. I am concerned that after making the effort to send the phone back next day special delivery, that it's been lying around somewhere and might have been damaged (I hope not). After speaking to someone today, I found out a payment for ¬£240 is being processed. This is ¬£125 short of what I was expecting. Further to that the payment will take another 3-5 working days. So the NEXT DAY marketing material is a lie. I am now having to wait another 48hours to find out where's the missing ¬£125.",0
Delivered promptly. Easy to set up and works very well.,1
"Needed replacement dishwasher quickly and Marks offered the best price for the model I wanted, and had it in stock. Delivery available within a few days and everything was great. Arrived within the 2 hour time slot provided and Simon and Josh couldn't have been more helpful.",1

"Not even 1 star. Worst TV package ever. Ordered nowtv stick a week and a half later it hadn't arrived but nowtv took 3 payments from my account??? When I tried to contact them about this, they didn't have a telephone number for queries, only if you wanted to join. What a joke! I am a single mum lost my job recently
and wanted some decent TV to watch, instead I am 3 bank transactions down and still no TV package!! I advise strongly not to subscribe to nowtv. Unfortunately without a refund I will be looking elsewhere",0

I bought iPhone 12 pro and I should receive it by 23/10/2020 but I don‚Äôt receive it than I cancelled from 23/10 still I haven‚Äôt refund money back ?!,0
it's very good service and customer service.,1
Brilliant service. Over and beyond what they offer.,1
Brilliant item and under 24hours delivery!,1
Received a courtesy phone call an hour before my item was due to arrive which really surprised me as I was just expecting a text message. Delivery team was very friendly and professional. Will definitely use again. Currys & team knowhow.,1
"This was a while ago now but still can‚Äôt believe this happened... We called customer service regarding my mothers account to help with the internet that was constantly dropping off. When calling they declined that it was, refused to help at all and was so very rude it was unbelievable! With one member of staff, I said something along the lines of ‚Äúhonestly mate it does drops off‚Äù and they reply ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your mate, don‚Äôt you dare call me that and I‚Äôm not helping you with something that‚Äôs working fine‚Äù (it wasn‚Äôt fine). They then of course refused to provide their name and hung up on us... the next person to answer wasn‚Äôt as rude but still failed to help (did not call the next day as promised). After constantly calling we eventually got through to someone that sent maintenance over and fixed the issue (maintenance guy was great). All I know is that this was their Newcastle branch in the UK which were rude and unprofessional. Very happy we are no longer with BT, Vodafone‚Äôs 4G wifi has been much better and rectified one small issue instantly!",0
Only a small item but swift and efficient service,1
All items delivered quickly. Very happy.,1
"Do not buy from GHD!! I ordered a hairdryer at the end of November. Dispatched beginning of dec. Not arrived by 20th dec so contacted the company. Updated to delivered on 28th Dec by Hermes (it wasn‚Äôt). A further 5 contacts later and they finally respond. No meaningful apology, just fill in this form to promise that you haven‚Äôt had it!! This has now been dragging on for over 6 weeks!! Customer service is appalling!! Can‚Äôt comment on the hairdryer as haven‚Äôt got it",0
"Excellent communication throughout, prompt delivery and product as described",1
"Avoid at all costs. Now tv changed our WiFi installation date on two occasions without consulting us meaning that we missed both, then they cancelled our contract when we didn‚Äôt ask them to. Ordered it again and once again they sent an engineer on a Wednesday when the Tuesday was agreed. Lost out on a days work as I had to wait in for the engineer. WiFi was supposed to come on at 00:00 and didn‚Äôt so we called again and they said an engineer would visit the next day between 08;00 and 13:00, no engineer shown up and still no WiFi after months. Also nearly impossible to get through to customer service",0
"Great company, very helpfull Staff. Good Job Iwona, thank you!",1
This is the second phone I have bought from them as I think they are good value for money and it works well. What I should have done was join there loyalty programme,1
I was impressed by the competitive price and prompt delivery of my order - will be happy to shop with this company again. Well done!,1
"I have just signed up and I have already received a welcome chat that included support for questions, concerns, and feedback. I already have missions to complete and linking my social media accounts could not have been easier.",1
You sent us a dishwasher with 4 dents and the side panel looks like it's coming off. You were no help what so ever you said because I didn't have a credit account I couldn't get a replacement I would have to pay for another one until 14 days when I get a refund. This was not my fault yet I'm without a dishwasher now .this will be the first and last time I use your company very discusted.,0
Never received my item? Contacted customer services and didn‚Äôt get back to me,0
"Their customer service on here will post a response apologising for the inconvenience and asking for details, but that‚Äôs all they‚Äôll do. They will never actually look into the issue/complaint. This is a total pretence. The same goes for their twitter messaging @currys and @CurrysServices, where their reply will state that it‚Äôs been 24 hours since their last response, therefore they need you to share your details again to be able to look into the issue. But they never will. Instead, they‚Äôll just send the same message again and again, regardless of anything you post. Calling them will take you through many steps to be able to talk to someone, they will apologise for the inconvenience, take all of your details again and tell you that it‚Äôs being looked into. But nothing ever happens. Clearly they do not care about customers whatsoever, otherwise they would actually do something about it and action complaints.

I called them about my TV repair to check on progress, because they didn‚Äôt show up after I‚Äôd received a text telling me it was being delivered (the night before). I‚Äôd taken the morning off work to be home for it, but then got a text mid-morning saying that it was still at the repair centre waiting for a part. I also called customer services and got hung up on twice, asked to speak to a manager twice and was told none were available but I could have a call back from a manager. Never received any calls even after having two scheduled call backs. Another time, I suddenly received a text saying that they would be with me in half an hour. The guy showed up and said he was here to pick up a TV, not drop mine back to me ‚Äì absolutely shambolic. It‚Äôs now Christmas, and I still don‚Äôt have a TV after 3 weeks, with no idea when it will come.

December 28: As per below, I emailed the curry‚Äôs email address given (contactsocial) with the code advised and have received no response whatsoever. These are generic responses and insincere apologies given by Curry's, with no intention of ever acting upon them.

January 10: Still no TV after more than a month, and no idea when I'll have it .I received a call from a guy who said I would get a voucher if not fixed within 28 days, but then got a call from someone else who said that was wrong. Apparently the 5-year guarantee doesn't give a time limit for the repair, otherwise I could have had a voucher instead. The guarantee agreement isn't worth the paper it's written on, nor are any promises made by any Curry's staff especially callbacks. I had been expecting a call today about progress but again absolutely nothing. Curry‚Äôs you may have apologised for the appalling customer service, but have failed to fix the fundamental issue - which is that I still have no TV after more than a month, or any idea when I‚Äôll have it. Followed by more bad customer service. This situation is absolutely unacceptable. I‚Äôm at the point where I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, and may need to look into legal action or other avenues to get the situation resolved.

January 13: Told by online twitter message, @currys services, that I‚Äôd be receiving a voucher within 72 hours, but then told by someone else from repairs by phone that they were still waiting for a part for the repair, and that a request for a voucher had been cancelled a week ago. So was it the @currys services lying to me, or the repairs team? I immediately messaged @currys services back telling them this and they just asked for my details again and didn‚Äôt respond. That is their pattern. Still no idea if and when this will be resolved. But in theory, Curry‚Äôs 5-year guarantee having no time limit for the repair, means that they could potentially indefinitely hold my TV until the end of the guarantee without ever resolving it, so I would never have my TV or money back. I'll need to look at other legal avenues now.

Avoid using this company at all costs, there are much better and more deserving companies out there with better customer service.

Update January 19: Curry's have finally resolved this issue with a full refund for the purchase price, thankfully.",0
Excellent service and value for money. A*,1
"This company makes me sick!!!!

"Wanted some seperates but 1 not in stock at the Southampton branch according to the website.
Gave them a ring and had a good discussion with Ben who checked and it was it stock and put them to one side.

Wanted to pay by card but whe ringing its a bank transfer thats sent, a note for next time. However, I could get to the shop by leaving work a little earlier and paid by card in full.

Arranged to collect them the following week which was today.

All staff were polite, courteous and helpful. As I was collecting Rob brought 1 box to the car which was a short walk away.

Nothing but praise for all at the branch.",1

"Similar issue to a prior review. I purchased a screen repair from Quick Fix in early February which I subsequently cancelled a day later. Two months later, despite assurances that I would be refunded, I have not received my refund and therefore I have now reported them to Trading Standards.

"I ordered invitations the 27/01/2023 because it says invitations arrived the next day of delivery. Its 01/02/2023 and the currier doesnt even dispatch the card yet because its EVRI company and it will take around 3 days instead 1 bussiness day as the website says. TERRIBLE DELIVERY SERVICE. please dont trust in what Optimalprint says about 1 day delivery. Moreover, I saw other reviews having the same issue",0
"There was a time when eBuyer was my goto store for computer parts, but their service has slipped remarkably.

My monitor died on me and so I needed a new one urgently. I placed my order, paid for next day delivery and waited.

On the day of delivery it still hadn't been despatched. No communication from the company as to why this was - I had to go and chase them.

I try not to buy everything from Amazon as we will regret it when other buying options have closed down, but my choices were Amazon or eBuyer. Had I gone with Amazon, I would have my monitor by now but as it is, I am going into the weekend without.

eBuyer - what has happened? Are you wanting all of your customers to shop elsewhere because that is what is happening due to your unreliability.

I was let down last year when I bought something from eBuyer and that wasn't delivered and so I thought they must have improved and so I gave them a second chance. More fool me and there will not be a third chance.",0
"Easy to sell , post off and receive payment",1
Quick clean and simple to use website and purchase journey. It would be a nice improvement to see something similar to MFA or 2FA as my account holds my personal details however I can not see a way to retrieve my payment details so this at least appears to be protected. I was kept informed of each stage of my purchase via automated email and the delivery company that was used was courteous and friendly and time from ordering to receiving was a great turnaround (Same week),1

"This company is one to stay as far away as possible. I purchased a phone in February 2020, it arrived with scratches all over it so needed to go back. I sent it straight back and they confirmed receipt of it's return a few days later. All sounds ok so far!!!!!
I was advised it would take 14 days for my refund, but it may take a little longer due to the current conditions. I accept we are in strange times and didn't push them to hard for the refund.
After 4 different promise dates of when I will receive my refund I am still waiting. I have just been given another date which I don't believe for one minute. Seven months+ is not an acceptable time scale for a refund in my opinion.
Do yourself a favor and DON'T use this company. They will rip you off and you can't even speak to anyone.
I will NEVER use this company again due to the lack of respect shown during our email conversations.
Apparently my name is Hotmail!!!!! even though I've told them several times my actual name.
They have replied to this review asking me to contact them through their support section!!!
I have approximately 18 emails through their support section, it just does not work. Time to bring in the credit card company.",0

"Big isn't beautiful. Virgin internet service is poor and inconsistent, often unable to deliver promised speeds or with an unworkable quality of connection. Long contracts with expensive cancellation terms are unreasonable and monopolistic. The new software for the TV service is clunky and imprecise to time-scroll back and forward. The hookup with O2 compounds the problems. Insufficient network investment means UK signal availability is worse than in 3rd world countries, and 5g is a complete joke both in terms of availability and reliability. Virgin and Sky are almost a duopoly in TV distribution and they take advantage of their position. Avoid if you possibly can.",0
"Perfect , quick delivery and worked very easily. Would thoroughly recommend!",1
It was awful experience first one person on the phone said part has been order rang the next day someone said it hasent been. Had no hot water or heating. Then all my accounts had been transferred to my sister account which I did not understand why they did this. I fell like the people over the phone did not know how to carry their job correctly. Whilst speaking to one of the ladies she cut me of no body bothered to ring back etc. asked to speak to a manager still not heard from them been few days waiting for my phone call. Back.,0

Buying large domestic appliance online from Argos turned out to be a horrible experience. There was an offer for delivery with installation, recycling and removal of packing, at fairly competitive price and in stock. After entering all details and pressing pay, the website froze for a couple of hours. Eventually the system came up and I finished the transaction. The order then was dutifully delivered but the driver was only set up to deliver and these were his instructions. I called the busy customer services and online chat to request recycling as soon as possible and/or some money back. I also did the installation myself which took 3 hours, but I complained and asked for compensation. The agent wanted to help by putting me through to her manager, but the manager refused. I argued and eventually the manager came online, with the attitude that I was a trouble-maker, and she wanted to cancel the order and collect and destroy the perfect new machine, leaving me with dirty washing and my broken machine taking up space and having to look elsewhere and go to launderette for weeks as well as eventually pay more (by this time argos's price had also risen). I said this wasn't right, the company had made me buy on false pretences. I asked for a more senior contact to e-mail or call and she refused, suggesting I wrote to customer services. Then she got annoyed and unprofessionally put the phone down on me. My conclusion is that Argos have both a dangerously unreliable online system which fails to record orders faithfully or keep a history, which isn't unusual, and a systemic lack of emphasis on correcting problems via human assistance when something inevitably goes wrong, which is so unusual that I've never experienced it anywhere else. Even though the agent understood and needed help, their manager was trained to stop this from happening when they should have been trained to find lateral solutions and use their additional powers to prevent loss of reputation like this. The manager's job is to help with SOLVING extra messy stories, due to their selection as being clever and customer-oriented. They should not act to further the harm to the company's reputation. I have contacted the credit card company who explained that a section 75 claim seems a very strong entitlement and they are now working on it. If I had known the order would be messed up, I wouldn't have reserved the whole day to wait in either, and then perhaps another whole day for another supplier! I would also have been able to order from another supplier before wasting 3 days to place my order and 1 day to protest. I also had an angry household with nothing clean to wear and my professional activities and peace of mind blocked for many many hours. I am also out of pocket, because there was no price reduction for non provision of the services - the full original price had been charged, dishonestly, due to bad planning for website crash (possibly the only way they can update the system) at same time as an order was being processed, and due to changing prices at same time as or even during a crash. Ironically the new website has a radio button for recycling which cannot be untoggled, hence I can't tell how by much I was cheated.
It should not be necessary to write to complain (and wait a couple of weeks) to sort out a technical mistake, which in any case required an interaction to piece together and provide visibility rather than denial of the facts. I wish I had photographed every
stage of the ordering process on the screen as evidence, but one tends to assume that a reputable company does this themselves, and the agents can raise a query, but not so at Argos!",0

"Did a phone trade in. Sent 25th October, all tracked and recieved. Downgraded the offer to alleged screen burn. Accepted the revised offer and still haven't been paid. Their terms and conditions state payment to be made in 3 working days and it's now 14th November so they are in Breach. Rung them and they were unable to give me any clear answers and to wait a further 3-5 days for payment. They also don't reply to any emails nor does the call centre let you speak to the trade in team. I'm not hopeful I'm going to be paid so I'm preparing to report them to trading standards and the consumer Ombudsman have effectively stolen my phone. Do not use them, choose another trade in company, even if they offer less as your time will be spent chasing them and not getting paid. Very unreliable and operating as thieves as they do not pay you for your phone. Do not use.",0

My experience :
26-8-2022 Phoned to give months notice of leaving BT.Told I was in a contract until Feb 2024 - I am NOT in any contract. After spending 45 minutes on the phone this was verified .Email sent to say my ""complaint is closed""?? Nothing to indicate what this email relates to and cannot reply.
27-8-2022 Email from BT - my services will be stopping today and I would be billed in excess of ¬£450 after I clearly told them that I was NOT in a contract and will be moving on the 19-9-2022.
45 "" telephone call to clarify that I will not be billed ¬£450 and my services will run until 19-9-2022.
Email sent from BT to put this in writing.
28-8-2022 Email from BT to state that all my services will be closed 2-9-2022???
Yet another 45"" call to BT , was told to ignore this email as it was sent by a computer!!
I now have my home phone disconnected , TV films & sport disconnected - I am still being billed for these items . I did not have any info from BT that they would stop these services . At least I still have broadband for ¬£75.00 a month.

Promises of return call to mobile not kept, or problems with connection being resolved. Received text message, stating should now be reconnected, but not. Email sent stating complaint now closed. Told only way to fix is by digging up established garden and drive for new cable, not having that. Cancelled BT due to frustration and lack of phone and broadband. Told would be subject to a month‚Äôs notice to be disconnected from a connection that isn‚Äôt working. BUT, BT still expect the bill to be paid. For what? Absolutely disgraceful. No point going to another supplier who would be using BT‚Äôs outside connection because there isn‚Äôt one! Looking into other options of which there aren‚Äôt many. Thanks BT for nothing!",0

This company is appalling! The customer service must be the worst I have ever come across in my life.They fail to rectify problems do not contact you at arranged times I have actually asked if they have an obnoxious training program for the staff as they are the rudest Cs agents I have ever come across. Have been experiencing constant broadband dropouts and they Insist there is no problem with the service the router cannot connect to a TV that is not even 20ft away as apparently it is a range issue also has trouble connecting to a TV that's 4ft away asked for a pac code to take my mobile to another supplier and spent nearly an hour on the phone with a member of retention team who blatantly lied to me promising to change a new contract price and duration which turned out to be a total pack of lies all in all a very disappointing experience and not handled at all well by the Cs or even by the supposed directors office apparently you can email the ceo and they are happy to provide an email address but he will ot read or respond its done by the same Inept incompetent agents who have there hands tied behind there backs. There is nothing in there remit that is actually of any benefit to the customer. They ask what they can do to rectify the situation but every avenue that could help is blocked by there protocols and nobody else above is available to discuss it with.BEST ADVICE IS STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY,0
Placed an order to have fibre optic installed. Was told we had to wait 6 weeks. 6 weeks later we were told they hadn't processed the order and we'd have to wait another 4 weeks.

Quick and painless. The process straight forward and phone was sold with cash paid into bank - start to finish less than a week. Impressive,1
"Testing of product was bad,so I recive my item with low battery life",0

"Appalling repair service response

After spending hours trying to contact knowhow repairs, and having my calls answered then put down, The treatment and frustration due to the lack of understanding and ignorance of how they are actually operating at the moment, taking for granted people‚Äôs custom, they need a sharp shock and realise people will not accept this when this situation is over. Right now they are using this current situation as an excuse for diabolical service!

I have a business account and have spent a fair amount of money in Currys over the years and had planned to going forward. I pay for two laptops insurance cover and up to now have never made a claim.

However, now when I need help it just isn‚Äôt there. I have been let down massively and am absolutely raging and disgusted with the treatment I have received.

I understand businesses are all trying to work through this situation but whatever Knowhow are trying to do with regards to the repair service, it is failing miserably!

I have a laptop that desperately needs repairing, I have paid my insurance policy and yet am nowhere near having my situation resolved. I simply don‚Äôt have time to spend days on the phone hoping those working from home will actually do what they‚Äôve been getting paid for.

One day they won‚Äôt have the monopoly and when a genuine competitor arrives god help them!

Just terrible

Update to my review and a message for Ryan who seems to be the responder to all complaints
IF YOU ACTUALLY READ THE REVIEWS YOU WILL REALISE THAT OUR CALLS ARE EVENTUALLY BEEN ANSWERED, THE PROBLEM IS WE ARE ALL BEING CUT OFF BY YOU OR YOUR STAFF (ARE YOU THE ONLY ‚ÄúHUMAN‚Äù WORKING AT KNOWHOW) SO STOP SENDING PATHETIC EXCUSES WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE CONCERNED AT ALL!
Hopefully once the store re-opens everyone concerned will get the chance to voice their complaints in stores for everyone to hear, cancel their agreements and take their business elsewhere in future!",0
"Appalling service

- with the Royal mail strike, I asked on the phone if I could transfer my contract onto my pay as you go sim that I have bought at the local shop. Nobody understood me. Customer service is all abroad.

This is a basic way around delays in the post. I also want to be able to fully utilise my colling off period having been able to take the SIM on the road to see what the network is like on long distance journeys.

I might call in at Three's shop (which I shouldn't have to do when I'm busy) and hopefully get somebody with a decent command of English as I can see your customer services is going to be a major reason why I wouldn't want to be three. The language barrier and equipment within the contact centres for call quality is extremely poor.

----‚Äê----

Followup

Called in at Manchester Arndale Three store, was told that this was possible.

I was made to wait 30 minutes and then told it wasn't as it wasn't ""Three's policy"".

I found an Email pointing to the reply below from Three, this took me to Three's standard webchat where they also said it was not possible to transfer the contract onto a three sim i already have in my possession but that I could go into the store.

I've since read all of the other reviews on here warning people to run a mile and so I'm telling Three they can shove their contract where the sun doesn't shine.

I should say they offered me ¬£5.00 compensation, then when refused, ¬£10.00.

Sorry - once bitten, twice shy. AVOID THIS NETWORK.",0
"I used CEX's Drop & Go to sell an Oculus Quest. I was quoted a good price for the item online and I dropped it into their Gloucester store on the following day.
They took the item, but no payment was received within 3 days, so I chased for an update using CEX's online contact form. Customer service emailed me to say they were contacting the store in question for an update.
The following day, 4 days from the date of dropping the Oculus into the store, I receive an email saying I will be paid almost ¬£100 less than quoted, then another email saying payment was cancelled, and then ANOTHER email saying I will be paid even less!
CEX have failed to follow multiple of their own rules stated on their own website: They did not properly process the Drop & Go on the day, they did not contact me in any way to confirm the substantial drop in price or grading, and payment was not made within 1 working day.
Of course there's no way to get a response from CEX immediately, so I've had to submit another online contact form to try and resolve this issue.

shame on this company for deceiving their customer",0
"Absolutely atrocious! Sent them my fully working iPhone for a trade in, only for it to be returned and it won't turn on! I upgraded my phone because I wanted a better camera, nothing actually wrong with the phone itself. Got a good price quoted online so sent it off (after waiting almost 2 weeks for the returns pack so my quote was almost out of date). Emailed the day the quote was due to expire to check that the price was still valid as phone had been delivered 3 days previously but this had not been acknowledged, only to get an email back advising that they had been unable to wipe the phone and the value was zero. Phone had been reset prior to sending. Not sure what they have done but am very unimpressed.

Extremely disgruntled with team know how. I‚Äôve been ringing for the past three days to report my faulty fridge freezer and every time I‚Äôve been told they have a technical fault. I rang this morning and was told to ring back at 4pm. I tried after a good number of times before I finally spoke to this lady who gave me the same old excuse of system failure. I‚Äôve had to go next door to my neighbour to keep my son‚Äôs antibiotic in her fridge. What‚Äôs the point paying for a service you can‚Äôt get when you need it? Highly Unrecommended.,0
Prompt despatch and if somethings wrong then let them know and it is sorted.,1
"Although the part was out of stock when I placed the order, eSpares kept me uptodate on the progress of the order (Thank you).

We then discussed my billing information and options going forward with regards to my monthly bank debits which have now also been updated. A big thank you to Ada.",1

"Criminals - why?
1) New customers get better deals than existing 'elite customers', 'elite customers' also get charged a set-up fee.
2) You get told to get lost when you complain.
3) Customer services supervisors and managers are too scared to talk to you on the phone so nothing gets resolved.
4) When they cancel your contract in the 14 day cooling off period, they charge you for an additional 30 days of service.
5) When I asked for a manager/supervisor to call me back the next day, guess what, no phone call because they are too scared.

Don't take any service out with these clowns.",0
"Required a phone quickly and ordered through carphone warehouse on line. Purchased phone and was guaranteed next day delivery. Received an email confirming delivery 28th December.
At 1am on 28th of December receive an email from DPD saying 29th December. I know one day doesn't seem a lot but that's why I bought it as they could do next day and I needed it on the 28th December. Also disappointing that the notification it was being delivered a day later came from a third partner.
I had saw the bad reviews but I had never had a problem before so went with my experience . Sadly after this will not be using again

Update. Despite the reply on this site from carphone warehouse blaming their delivery company, I can confirm I received a text today from carphone warehouse saying parcel would be delivered today, I also on checking with DPD the package was always to be delivered on 29th and not the 28th as promised. I know it's only a day but when you require it for that day you expect it delivered when promised.
Several emails have been sent with no reply.
Please consider using another company that's more reliable, I have sadly learnt that their trust pilot ratings low for a reason",0

I happen to know that Weston super mare staff will be stood around on the retail park at 9.30 am with NO customers so why is it so hard to answer a phone?

I don't believe they even know I'm calling. System clearly doesn't work.

Waste of time! lost my business!",0

They went on to say that D & G should have contacted me to advise me of this but I have heard nothing.
I was under the impression that the cost of ¬£150 would be refunded if the repair was not possible but I have heard nothing other than the No Reply email requesting the Review.",0

"Our internet connection over the last 9 years with previous companies has always been rock solid with consistent speeds connecting at between 35-40mbs.

Regrettably having recently fallen for a cheaper deal from Now with money back, we have now have the most unreliable connection we've ever had!!..... if we're lucky we get a few hours each day connected at our usual speeds and disgustingly for the other 18 hours we're lucky if it's connected at 3-5mbs..... As I'm writing this we're only getting 1.6mbs!!!!. Their line checks show all is ok !!!
They manage to arrrive at this conclusion as it is connected at the correct speed to Openreach,but when you actually need to connect to the web it then needs to use Sky/ Now equipment which clearly isn't working correctly and which they don't measure or take into account on their tests.

Luckily I've actually managed to cancel within the 30 day cooling off period & am going back to our last provider PLUSNET who miraculousy manage to provide everything that NOW clearly don't think is important :-

a.) A Reliable connection
b.) The speeds promised
c.) Good quality customer service",0

Please don't ""promise"" something you cannot fulfil & then have extremely high wait times so I cannot call to attempt to chase my order.

I was able to renew my contract at a lower monthly rate. The assistant was very helpful and proficient.,1
"I still haven‚Äôt received my order‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know where it is and Hermes can‚Äôt give me an answer.

Please can someone get in contact with me and let me know what is going on.",0
Rude and argumentative telephone support staff. Tried to explain that Virgin Media failed to give me new pricing information in sufficient time before my 18 month broadband bundle deal came to an end. They emailed new pricing less than 30 days before the end of the contract period. It was a huge price increase so I immediately cancelled but they continue to bill me past the end of the contract period. They took another month and a half to make a disconnection for which they are claiming ¬£35! Never going back to Virgin Media.,0
I love using the app to unlock points and badges!,1
Halid S handled my query promptly and was very helpful. Thanks,1
Item arrived damaged due to poor packaging and customer service very poor when emailed. Certainly won‚Äôt be using hmv online again.,0
Very professional and safe site to sell your old phone. As soon as they received the phone in less than 24hrs I received the payment.I suggest to all my friends to use a safe site than selling private in order to avoid scammers.,1
The part I ordered for my cleaner was great,1
"Was quoted a great price to sell my PS4 Slim. Dropped of at an Asda drop off point and after a few days I got paid the money.

Quite impressed with the service",1

Shout out to Craig D and his colleague ??? Credit to your company,1
Super fast delivery and the phone was just as described. Very pleased with the service thank you.,1
"I used these to deliver a washing machine, I stupidly paid for a time slot and they arrived late.

seems like they have done away with any form of customer service to make it impossible to complain because there are apparently a lot of people that need to.

whatever you do dont pay for a delivery slot with these if you're lucky it will actually arrive looking at previous reviews.",0
"Bt has gone downhill with broadband, and each time they send an engineer out, the problem does not get fixed. The internet keeps dropping. I have been on the phone trying to resolve, and I get fobbed off. BT are quick to blame their customers for faults. BT keep trying to tempt me into contracting with them for broadband are declined. Never again.

An update, BT are trying to re-contract me and will never be doing. A weight has been lifted finally.

My final and last update about moving on from BT.....

I cancelled BT after being fed up with my line not working. Luckily I am out of the two-year contract. The bad boys wanted to check that I was out of the contract before applying the leaving bt process.

BT are charging me an extra month fee with no working phone line that was supposed to be fixed on Wednesday after reporting on Friday. Bt says now the problem should be fixed on the 28th of July 2021 I asked what did the engineer do on the 21st to resolve it. OPEN REACH established a problem and said there were no more notes. So all I know is they came, assessed and went to Macdonalds. BT fraudsters tell me the problem should be fixed, and I am in the minority few who have a problem with BT.

I will be happy when I am rid of the stupid false company who rip you off. BT tried to get me to upgrade to fix the problem. STAY CLEAR OF THESE LOSERS! Before you are locked in HELL!",0
"I wait 2 weeks to come engineer, and when came , stayed 10 minutes, told me can‚Äôt to help but I will come in 2 hours with another engineer. Yes ok , I will wait you . Is 6 p.m , I called him , I let message, nothing. I called at Bt customer service, one lady ‚Äúoh no, he will come late ‚Äú when late , at 10 p.m ? Today I called again , they to make me another appointment 18 October! Why 18 October, when you should go send emergency on 3 October because not was my problem, you have unskilled workers!!! If you not resolve this problem until 5 October, I will cancel this contract!!",0
"If I could give less than one star I would, I cannot even put into words how much I hate NowTV.
The stick constantly crashes, the remote always stops working, it always says it can‚Äôt connect to the internet even though we can connect our phones and tablets to the WiFi, I‚Äôve had to reset the stick about six times this month alone, if someone was trying to provide a service which was gonna infuriate people, this is how you would do it.",0
"Even though there was a postal strike it all went really smoothly, I was notified as soon as I took the phone to the Post Office and then received notifications until the money was transferred",1
I checked and double checked with the online chat operator that I was getting the correct piece for my oven. They were wrong!! So I had to pay two call out charges. They apologised for sending the wrong part but no compensation despite admitting that they had got it wrong. I wrote to the director of the company and didn‚Äôt even get a reply. I would NEVER use them again. Be very cautious about using this company.,0
"Joined NOW TV on August 2022 in their 21¬£ monthly super fibre plan. This tariff was for one year. I moved house on 30th September and also moved my Now broadplan plan. Got my 1st bill in my new home on 18th October and they have changed my bill to 35¬£.
Also the home movement experience was very bad. The engineer visit was supposed to be on 6th October but that happened on 14th October. I was not informed of the delay and had to call them multiple times for updates",0

"I‚Äôve used deliveroo a lot, I‚Äôm baffled how a company and their riders can consistently get it wrong and offer absolutely no courtesy or compensation. they‚Äôre incompetent from top to bottom and they don‚Äôt deserve any business. Not to mention restaurants have to hike their prices for deliveroo because deliveroo take such a big cut of the profits. My advice is to never use Deliveroo and just order privately from restaurants.",0

"0800 800 150. I'm on my mobile 'phone listening to the awful BT on-hold music, and worse still, it's distorted though my 'phone's speaker, so it sounds like the music is playing under water, beneath crashing waves. It's the kind of noise that would warble out of a tannoy system in hell to torture the souls of the damned!

I'd call BT on the landline but the landline's reception is worse still, and anyway the allegedly unfixable landline, which crackles and fades to the point the caller's voice becomes inaudible, and has done so for decades, is another BT saga. No, this story today is about my home hub delivery that BT repeatedly dispatches to the wrong address.

Gratefully, this week, I've only notched up three hours of conversation with BT call centre staff, interspaced with wobbly wait music, (and that's relatively low time wasting ) while, predictably, yet another employee in BT f**ks up again and again...and so it goes... on and on.

I swear I do try to be respectful and polite to them.

You see, my problem is that BT can't send a home hub to my correct home address despite my paying them 60+¬£ per month for the service. Six weeks , after placing my order, I'm still making 0800 800 150 'phone calls and repeating my delivery details to different staff.

Back to the current call. The music has finished and I'm now repeating my postcode to yet another BT guy, who pretends he suffers from chronic dyslexia, as once again, he asks me for my delivery details. This is the FITH time today he's done this.

Dear readers, at this point, some of you must be wondering, do I perhaps have a speech impediment? I assure you that I do not.

So, could it be that my house is difficult to find? Nope. Amazon deliver here , as do Royal Mail, regularly, and they have zero problem in comprehending where I live, proving you don't need a brain like Alan Turing's to decrypt my location from my delivery details .

This is agony! The BT call centre worker is now pretending to be a complete idiot; he must be playacting, because for the SIXTH time during our conversation, he's asked me for my home address and postcode and when I double-check to see if he's entered it correctly, he keeps getting it wrong

Now, here's the thing these call centre workers can't be this stupid, and I have gradually come to believe, over hours of conversations with many different , seemingly incompetent, clueless BT workers, that they are in fact bored, and they are taking out their workplace frustration on their customers.

Or, it could be that BT staff are rather cunning, and it's an attempt to drive me to utter exasperation. So, what do they expect me to do? Maybe, that I drive the 50 mile round trip to the wrong delivery address and retrieve my home hub, along with all the rest of the hubs they claim to have sent there? Perhaps I will kindly take these other misdirected home hubs to the nearest post office and post them back to BT?

Well I'm not doing that.


Whatever the reason, here's a curious BT organizational/behavioural rule: ask BT call centre workers to perform a simple task (like correct a wrong delivery address), and their staff will invariably do the opposite of what you request.

This apparent problem with simple comprehension and retention of information, could be organizational and systemic, and, if it's not a cunning strategy, then I suggest that it has it origins partly in human nature which experiences working for BT as soul- crushing call centre boredom, and partly in how BT as an organization demoralizes and dehumanizes their call centre staff, because as I wrote, human beings individually can't be this stupid... because otherwise they would require support and care workers to help manage their daily lives.

Wasting a precious hour writing this? Nope. Good practice for the full and edited MSM article. Gruniad stuff-of it is.

And, please do ignore this John 'bot's' replies, it's all bulls***t. If I contact BT on his advice, I'll be chatting to maybe three more people again, for another hour, none of whom will be able to correctly take down my address details. Why should I waste yet another precious hour even attempting to get any sense out of them?

Oh, and many thanks for the 'direct' links to your helping colleagues on Facebook and Twitter, John. Of course, the Facebook link just takes me to the generic BT page, and I'd have to spend hours searching for the right person. Good laugh for you guys, but then, I've come to imagine one section of hell is probably a giant, pointless call centre, just like BT. And one consolation, I'm not the one trapped inside it.

Update. 3 Days later : Despite hours on the 'phone to BT call centre staff, and numerous promises from them, did the home hub ever arrive, at my address? Of course it didn't! I didn't expect it to. Soon it's going to be 2 months, ¬£140.00, and no service.",0

I'm not loving Windows 11 but this is what I chose. Service was great as it always has been.",1

"Absolutely terrible experience. Been with them for 5 years now. Moved house which required a technician for installation. They missed that appointment and did not provide any update. After rescheduling they booked in the wrong date and then told me the originally planned date was no longer available. It has been 2 weeks already and I still don't have internet. If any other company offered such speeds I would not have chosen this sorry excuse of a company in the first place. If you would like to pay an exorbitant amount of money in exchange for the worst service possible, go with virgin media.",0
Literally appalling delivery and appalling customer service to add. Ongoing complaint screenshots sent of my account and yet you can‚Äôt find my account. You deliver my goods when I had rearranged the time and that‚Äôs my fault?! 2.5 hours to wait for my delivery the times had been put back 3 times so I had to rearrange as I had to go out. New time confirmed and you delivered when I was out and said I couldn‚Äôt have a refund! Never use this service again!,0

"I ordered and purchased my latest setup through PC Specialist and loved the experience - right from how easy it was to understand the website layout to post delivery service. I got email notifications of every step of the process of my PC being built, checked and delivered. The delivery was in a very secure and timely manner. And the customer support promptly answered a couple of questions I had after I had checked my system. Through that, I learnt they implemented user feedback regarding the back legs of the case I ordered to prevent damage. Great service, would use again in future when I need to upgrade my setup.",1
"Bought GHD straighteners, they got to 2 weeks outside of the warranty and they are now not working.

"Faulty router needed to be replaced, told it would arrive on a certain date. It didn't. Called back, they blamed DPD and Queens death.Turns out they never sent it due to a technical issue. Apparently it can't be fixed so they had to request to cancel that request and put through another and wait 48hrs. After 48hrs turns out they made an error on the request so it didn't go through. Another 48 hours, the back office team ask if I received the item, bear in mind the replacement was never sent and they should already know that or could have easily checked, so back to waiting another 48hrs just to cancel a request that is stuck due to a technical issue they are aware of. Pretty poor service for what should be a simple resolution.",0

A few months ago my wife and daughter were pulling out of a retail store car park when a Deliveroo rider rode straight across the front of the his bike hit the front wing he was riding on the pedestrian walkway opposite to the flow of traffic and came from behind a bush which was obscuring the view He then stood up and gave the most foul abuse to my wife and daughter and kicked the rear wing causing a dent and smashed her wing mirror off the car. I reported this to the Police but they said local cameras were insufficient to provide any help.
I reported this to Deliveroo but suprise suprise they cant identify any rider that was in the area at the time I have sent many emails with descriptions and pictures and exact locations as requested but they keep asking for order number and restaurant involved but this was not involved They are obviously ignoring the situation hoping it will go away.MY WARNING TO YOU IS IF YOU USE DELIVEROO IN ROMFORD YOU MAY COME UP AGAINST THE SAME PSYCO THAT WE DID AND IF YOU COMPLAIN TO HIM ABOUT YOUR ORDER LATE ETC WHAT WILL HE DO!!!!!!!!!
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT DELIVEROO WILL DO NOTHING
PLEASE SHARE THIS TO WARN OTHERS",0

"My 5 Star Review is for Sidney in the Customer Service Department, not for Shell Energy itself. Our supply was transferred to Shell Energy in Sept 2021 from a smaller company which collapsed. We were emailed by Shell to confirm that we didn't need to take any action and that the handover of the account would all happen seemlessly. Months went by and we still hadn't received details of the new account, despite our chasing customer service and being told it was in the pipeline. More months went by and we still hadn't received a bill. Eventually someone admitted that the account hadn't been set up properly. We were then assured a bill would be generated on the next cycle. It didn't happen. We were then assured it would be generated on the next cycle. Again it didn't happen. Eventually, the lovely Sidney took ownership of the issue and, after several weeks, our account is set up properly and the first bill has been generated - it only taken 15 months!!! Sidney has been wonderful but our experience of Shell Energy hasn't been great, so far!",1

"I bought an OLED from Currys about 18 months ago for ¬£1499. It started to show a fault in the display (solid rectangle box in the centre of the screen which had nothing to do with burn-in. a quick google search noted it was from faulty production line). It came with a 5 year warranty.

Having used Team Knowhow in the past and being less than impressed with the service received, therefore I took no great joy in sending it in for repair to them.

I made the call and was in a queue to be heard for about 15 minutes. After the wait the operator was well versed in asking what they needed to know and answered all of the questions I had.

It was to be collected on the Monday and arrive back (subject to delay) on the Saturday. A text arrived the night before and the collection was within that time. Likewise a text arrived the night before the TV was due to be returned, and it too arrived within the time specified.

The delivery drivers offered to screw the TV back into the stand but I declined this offer.

The TV arrived in the same condition I sent it in and the repair report noted the parts replaced (in this case a faulty OLED panel).

Overall I was very happy with the service received and has restored some faith I have for the company.

Much thanks.",1

"I purchased an IPhone 13 Pro Max online and received a power bank instead.

Now Currys are rejecting my claim despite the fact that I have the sealed package at home with a power bank inside instead of my IPHONE 13 Pro Max, have video recording talking to customer service when they told me that they have the phone on their possession and many other evidences . One of the advisors told me that they moved their call centre in South Africa and the advisors aren't trained properly. Such a disgraceful service üòí . It is a shame because the in store staff are doing a great job.",0
My son is very happy with the product. There was a delay in it arriving but as soon as we contacted them their communication with us was excellent and the computer ended up arriving 2 days earlier than we expected much to the joy of our son. We highly recommend this company.,1

Do not use them. My data was leaked in the Optus thing. Money was taken from my account through this company. I have sent over 70 emails including proof it wasn‚Äôt me who made the transaction. STILL they won‚Äôt refund and are now blaming my bank. I have spoken to my bank and the fraud department of my bank and I have sent evidence to them and they still say it will take 5-7 days for refund YET they can take my money from an account not even using a real email address. My bank has said as soon as the funds are returned it will clear. They are saying no it‚Äôs my banks fault. Well I‚Äôll believe a bank over a company listed in the UK yet the bank accounts are in Lithuania and NOW I‚Äôm getting emails from a Chinese account asking for more details to prove I deserve a refund. Absolute scum bags‚Ä¶ HOW CAN I GIVE A RECEIPT NUMBER IF I DIDNT ORDER WHATEVER IT WAS!! They even said my email wasn‚Äôt linked to an account which is f$&king obvious BECAUSE I DONT HAVE AN ACCOUNT WITH THESE PEANUTS,0

"Have spent last two months being pushed from pillar to post trying to get our washing machine fixed.First of all an engineer was booked about which we heard nothing for 3 weeks. We then recently called to chase it up each telephone operator saying we‚Äôre not on the system and pushing us on to another operator after nearly two hours on the phone back to the first operator who tells us that we need to speak to someone else !!?? The fact is we bought our washing machine from Currys with the Know How warranty and since then every month our bank account has had ¬£4.50 a month direct debited by Curry's with a policy number next to it that Know How tel no: team says isn‚Äôt on their system. That can‚Äôt be the case as we‚Äôve used the warranty with the same policy no: in the past and received a prompt service
I‚Äôm beyond disgusted with them and just feel we are being fobbed off to avoid the cost of repairing our washing machine. Although we used the warranty in the past and received a repair using the policy number, for the past few years haven‚Äôt made a claim. Will Currys refund us 3 years (¬£162 which would go a long way towards a new machine) of a warranty that we‚Äôve used before but they say they don‚Äôt recognise!!!???

"And another day waiting

I bought a Mid Range OLED TV (LG55E6V) on the 15/01/2017, this came with a FREE 5 Year TeamKnowhow Warranty, as does the current Mid Range model (LG OLED55GX6LA) as shown in shop and on-line.

Note that if the warranty was not free and included I would not have bought the TV from Currys but gone to Richersounds, where I get a free 5 year warranty.

Know to a timeline of events

Returning from holiday on the 31st of July, TV would not turn on, it displayed a green vertical line and switched straight back off again.
Went into the Portsmouth Store on Saturday the 1st of August.
A collection of the TV was arranged for 3rd of August, the person who made the arrangements had both my mobile number and e-mail address.

On the 7th of August your tracking web-page stated that the TV arrived at your service/repair dept on the 3rd of August a few hours after pickup and was currently being repaired.

When I checked after the weekend (on the 10th of August), the web page asked me to call the 0344 561 1234 number. This I did and after having to wait about 25 minutes someone actually answered the phone.
Your agent informed me the reason I had to call was that they did not have me contact details (despite me giving them in store) and that the TV could not be repaired as the screen had died and spare parts were not available.
I was then told they were going to contact LG to see if they would replace the TV. It was also stated that the tracking web page would be updated, and until it was to ignore the request for me to call them.

After emailing the staff member that originally dealt with the return) on Tuesday (11th) and Wednesday for progress (as the tracking web page had not been updated), I was told it could take 5 days for LG to respond.

So 5 days would make it Friday the 14th, I gave them the benefit of waiting until the 19th. The web page had still not been updated and after waiting on the phone for 57 minutes and 48 seconds I was cut off.
So I went into the store to be told (and shown on the screen) that the TV had been declared irreparable and a voucher was being issued (which could take up to 3 days).

So today is the 3rd day, still the tracking page has not been updated, so I called 0344 561 1234 twice to get an update and both times after waiting about 34 minutes listening to some sort of music it changed to a ringing tone (waiting for someone your end to answer)
both times after a further 10 minutes or so the call was ended by your end. This caused me to have to go back into the store to get an update. I was told that there was now a voucher number but no amount had been as yet allocated.
The store operative called to find out what the value was only to be told that the voucher had not been validated as yet and this might be done on Monday or Tuesday.

I believe that the whole process (except for the first store visit) has been a shambles.
You have not met your 7 day repair or voucher for replacement promise (although I realize that in the current climate you are saying 12 days), to date it has been 18 days and we are still counting.
We feel that we have made all the effort and that we have had to travel into the store to get any sort of information or update.
Surely it does not take days for someone to press a button or enter a few lines of text into your system.

This has been dragging on for too long and we want it resolved as soon as possible.

Just to repeat, Non-repairable TV, so Issue a validated voucher. This surely should not take nearly a month.

Your store staff have tried to be helpful but the way your system works does not allow them to be of much help.",0
"Quick appointment, engineer on time and very efficient",1

"I would not of given this Service any stars at all!!!!!!! The only reason it got 1 star as it would only let me access if given a star. So I'm taking my star back!!!!! We have paid into this insurance cover for our washing machine for 10 year's plus when purchasing the insurance cover we were told an engineer would be out within 2/3 days of breakdown, absolute rubbish. The machine stopped working Thursday 9 May, phoned team know how Friday 10 May, engineer would be with us 16th May I booked holiday off work and NO SHOW, I EVENTUALLY spoke to someone who told me that no one was coming , they did have my details but there had been a computer error and the engineer did not have the details to do repair,gave us another date for TODAY, GUESS WHAT??? ANOTHER NO SHOW engineer was sick , SICK ??? Not as sick as us!!!! Next date is 25th May!!!! That's a tad more than the 2/3 days of the guaranteed wait for repair !! Absolutely shocking Service, my husband wants to go to the store and demand the money back and that still might happen if we do not get the service we have paid for the last 10 years plus, we kept to our deal with the regular on time payments to this company but this has not been returned!!!!!!",0
Loved this app. Very helpful and convenient to use,1
"I would like to clarify that Aaron the person who was in customer service was extremely professional and helpful he offers everything that we need and helps us to have the best offer. I am very disappointed because carphone warehouse took ¬£1 for my account apparently to verify my bank details and they suppose to give me back that ¬£1 at the end they took ¬£2 from my bank account and never refunded me that money and this is the second time that has happened to me. Two years ago was exactly the same I never received my money back, seems this is like a strategy to make money for their customers, is few but still is dishonest",0
"The delivery service and customer care is terrible!! We were having a washing machine delivered to our caravan we could only get delivery on a Wednesday or Friday so my husband and I took a day off work to be able to accommodate the delivery slots. We were given as expected a delivery window of 5hrs the night before which was fine and was also told we would get a call a couple of hours before delivery which would give a better idea of the delivery time. Or slot was between 11.20 and 3.20 by 4pm there was no call or delivery we called team know how for help and they could not contact the drivers and said to call back at 5pm which we did, they still could not contact the drivers but assured us that they must be running late but the machine would be delivered as promised. At 6pm I checked the tracking and it showed as delivered but certainly not to us. I called team know how again and they confirmed it had been delivered and signed for. The attitude of the customer service person at team know how was ridiculous It was it had been delivered what are you complaining about!! Although we were having the delivery to a holiday site curry‚Äôs were given full contact info and also told if there was any issues to ask at the office. They delivered the machine to the site without contacting us or asking at the office. Just left it at site. We had to work out where the machine was and then arrange for it to be delivered to us from where it was left. At an additional cost along with loss of income and a wasted day sitting about waiting for the delivery. Then also to re arrange installation for a different day as had been organised for the day of delivery!",0

Poor handling of lost delivery. An item was taken from the package by Yodel.

No we can't give you a deadline, it's out of our hands.
REALLY! Cowboys, if they don't call me back within the promised 48hrs (yes 48hrs to get to talk to someone) then I'm walking away.

update 15th Dec: well they called back. A couple of times actually. it's 2 weeks on an dI still don't even have a date of when I'll get broadband. Can't find the words for how broken the customer support structure is - advisors are trying their best but no support for them to help me. Fingers crossed that Father Christmas will bring me broadband!
@TalkTalk BTW. Sick of talking! Just F'in move the cable from the BT box to the TalkTalk box and connect my house to the F'in Broadband! It's not launching a rocket to the Moon!",0

"I came to follow up my review from a couple of days ago and all I can say is WOW! I read through the reviews which have posted since and see that Team Knowhow are providing poor service to majority of customers.

As per the follow up message that Dan from Team Knowhow had left for me, I emailed the letusknow address with all the details he specified. Has anyone replied? Of course not! Has the damaged dishwasher that they delivered to me been collected? Nope! Have they refunded my money? Don't be silly!

I continue to deal with incompetent advisers on their phone line and now find myself getting extremely frustrated and angry with them, something I do not normally do.

I would really urge people to not use this company!",0
"From easy to use website to having washing machine installed I was kept up to date at every stage. The two men who delivered the machine were polite, friendly and very efficient.

"This is a company of crooks AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE
I ordered an internet package for ¬£34.99 when moving house as my bill had gone up to over ¬£70 a month
I had huge difficulty getting hold of the confirmation email which was not sent through this or another property and asked twice for a confirmation email which they did not send
I then phoned them and they said that the order I made for a ¬£34.99 package had gone through and they were sending me a hub.
I got my bill and it was over ¬£80 because they managed to put me on a contract for twice that amount of money
When I complained I got this absolutely vile woman on the phone who miraculously sent through a confirmation email even though they had failed to do this twice and they refused to put it on the contract I ordered. This is a very clever and unethical way of ripping people off - failing to send out an email and then charging people to be on a different contract basically a SCAM",0

"Absolute joke, trying to cancel my subscription but still wanting to charge me for another 30 days. I understand you would normally give 30 days notice as that's your process etc but when my contract ended and I was automatically moved onto a rolling contract i still assumed that so when I called and enquired about the notice period to cancel, I was told I wouldn't need to give the 30 days as I wasn't tied down to a contract but now they want to charge me for another 30 days. Clearly I got advice off someone who didn't have a clue. Not happy and so glad I'm leaving Virgin Media. Was told there isn't a complaints no or team they could direct me to, talking to offshore suppprt teams is so frustrating.

Further to the below response from Beth. I would have given that 30 day notice if I was advised correctly in the first place which I wasn't when I enquired and your below response is no good to me now Beth, maybe pass that info on to the team/person that I spoke to on the previous occasion as I won't be returning to VM in the future.",0

"I've had my pc for a little while now and wanted to wait before leaving a review as I think it's important to fully evaluate things after a period of time, especially when there may have been issues.

I ordered a rather high end system and had a specific look and build in mind.
The ordering and configuration process was fluid and easy, their website is so easy to use.
I ordered the system with a Nivida Gpu, from the outset I was told there was a delay on these due to global problems, this in turn meant that my build time would be slower than the stated times.
Once I had ordered the build and while I waiting for it to progress into the build stage I added and removed several parts including adding multiple fans and in specific setup that the configuration tool didn't have the ability to do, this meant emailing them, explaining what I needed and then adding it to the order.
They did this with no trouble at all and they got everything I wanted exactly right.
The system arrived in perfect condition, fully set up as I had requested and cable managed about as good as if I'd done it myself so very happy with that.
A few months alter I had an issue with the Gpu, contacted support, spoke to a really helpful agent called Chris, who took me through various steps to try to resolve the issue remotely.
When this didn't work they shipped (next day) a new Gpu.
This now works flawlessly.

So from start to finish to after care, I have had exemplary service.
This is the 2nd build I have had from them and will be happy to take buisness back to them for another one when the time comes.

I am fully capable of building a system myself but when the costs of doing so are so near to what PCS charge for doing it, and they have on both occasions I've dealt with them done such an outstanding job, I really don't see the need to.

I would happily recommend using PCS to anyone looking to purchase a custom built system.",1

"Ordered a iPhone XR on the 19th Sept and it still hasn't arrived. Cancelled the order and told refund would be in 14 working days, which seems to be the standard stalling response. Not sure if they will have the decency to make the refund according to others reviewers, so will no doubt have to raise a dispute through the credit card company. From the communications I've had you can only wonder if they actually had the phone or ever intended to dispatch it...?",0
"The incorrect part was supplied (although this was NOT the fault of FFX). Their customer service was excellent and the correct part was dispatched within 24 hours. This is a very honest firm to deal with, who takes customer satisfaction extremely seriously",1
I placed a Christians order last Monday based on the site stating orders are usually despatched within 24 hours. I hadn't received any notification by Thursday so messaged them. Two days later still no reply so messaged them again asking to cancel the order. The website wouldn't let me cancel the order. Raised a claim on PayPal and automatically received a refund notification saying I had to wait up to 30 WORKING DAYS. The fact I got an automatic refund shoes that they clearly get so many claims they issue refunds without paypal getting involved. I had the same issue last year and should have known better.,0

"Ordered a fridge freezer from Currys, with a door reversal as it would be situated in a corner and difficult to access otherwise. Was told the high fee for this was 'because an engineer has to make sure it's done correctly for the door seals'.

They missed the original 4-hour delivery slot (all my food is defrosting in a chill bag waiting for the new fridge during this time) but call me at the point they *should* have arrived to ask what kind of installation I needed. Thought this was odd, but turns out as they were running late they said they hadn't got time to fit the door in the way I needed (and paid for). The chap eventually relented and said he'd do it 'as a favour', but panicked when he took the top off and said he wasn't familiar with the model, hadn't been trained and left it as it was. Off they went to the next delivery.

Cue an hour or so trying to get through to someone to arrange another visit. Someone came the following day (on time) and switched the door around as needed. However, there wasn't a necessary part, so wires were left exposed near a hinge, and after the fridge had been switched on for five minutes, the 'door open' alarm started going off every 20 seconds.

Loud. Relentless. Unstoppable. Like the Terminator, only more annoying. Every twenty seconds. You can hear it right through the house.

Called the manufacturer, and the earliest they could visit was 1 week's time. I think a shrieking fridge would crack an interrogation suspect in less time than that, going off every 20 seconds. Tried the Team Know How line and got forwarded to the manufacturers, who I'd already called.

It's clear they haven't a clue what they are doing, they're just an expensive subcontractor bluffing their way through jobs, and the products from Currys are shoddy, incomplete and sold with no care as to customer satisfaction at all. The first delivery guy to come around spent all of his time blaming and complaining about Currys and his lack of training, never once apologising that we were left without a working fridge. Where was this 'engineer' I had paid for? Chap clearly knew as much as I did about fridge doors. Second guy I called after the alarm kept going off just said 'we're out of the area now, good luck'.

Amazing that any company would want this organisation as their public-facing arm.",0

I asked if I could collect my order from the door so I was near the car and could see it. A member of staff offered to stand at the door for me whilst I collected my product. This meant a lot as a busy mum. Then whilst outside I was putting a pram together that I just bought and a member of staff came out and offered to take the box away from me. It was very refreshing to have such good customer service and made my day a lot easier. Please could this be passed on to the store.",1
Brought as a present as I have one too brilliant brush especially if you have long hair.,1
Great service always get my order within a day or two at the most other mail order companies need to look at very as I waited over a week for my order from another mail order company keep up the good work very,1
It seems pretty cool so far. I'm experimenting with the app and still learning how to utilize it.,1
"Shocking delivery service . 2 guys with poor English tramping mud through the house , couldn‚Äôt find where to turn the water off . Not allowed to turn it off from the mains in the street as they are not plumbers . Told me I should call a plumber and left me with old dishwasher still plumbed in and new dishwasher with no instructions. Waiting for plumber . Terrible service .",0
"Your store in Poole know they can be rubbish. As there is not many other places to go.
Placed an order yesterday 10/01/23 for click & collect @ 13:55 CUR2332190971 Then @ 14:39 get an automated email saying my order had been cancelled. No explanation why. So out of annoyance i went to the branch today 11/01/23. Staff available at the front or in there packs. But none to help any customers. And some guy walking around with a clip board. That i later learn is the manager. Who also did not want to help. And was going to ask someone else to?
Out of annoyance i decided to leave as was made to feel more of a burden. However on my exit i did find myself talking to a very helpful gent. On the tills who couldn't have been more helpful. We managed to find out that all the items i placed on my click and collect order. Were all in fact in stock. They just couldn't be bothered to look. Given the shop floor staff's attitude i am not surprised. Including the ""manager."" I am still waiting for my money to bounce back into my account too. The lad who helped me on the tills is wasted in a place like yours!

Update: My money has still not been returned to me! Three days after the cancelled order! And im now going into the weekend ¬£900 out of pocket! Thanks Currys!!! 13/01/23",0

"Terrible and time wasting. Spent weeks trying to get an analytical report for my damaged laptop that they promised would be couriered back with the laptop. I needed the report to prove to my insurance that it was damaged.

It never came and the customer service was such a long wait with hopeless staff all telling you different things and not actually getting the issue resolved properly.

Had to go through different departments by calling back several times to finally get through to the head of customer services and the head of repairs. They were finally helpful and got the report sent by email the next morning.

So in conclusion I could have avoided all this time spent waiting chasing them up on the phone and had it emailed to me 2 weeks earlier in the first place. Only if there wasn't so much miscommunication between the staff and that they would actually do the jobs properly!",0

"I have a lot of problems with my Now Broadband including occasional but noticeable speed drops, but by far their most frustrating downfall is their terrible customer service.

I have been on and off the phone with them for 5 months trying to resolve an account issue and the people I speak to are completely hopeless. It's like they just don't understand what I'm saying when I explain my situation to them.

They appear to have absolutely no incentive to actually help me and instead prefer to tell me to wait for weeks on end to see if various futile ""resolutions"" work. I've lost count of how many manager call backs I've been promised that never came, and when they do come they are mind-bogglingly useless.

Things go wrong sometimes, I get that, but Now Broadband's attitude is so unhelpful and dismissive that I'll never be using them again after the end of my contract.

Their problems are clearly systemic and not the result of a few bad eggs.",0
Very affordable and cheap services. Sellers respond fairly quick,1

Chris and the other driver (sorry I cant remember his name) were friendly, polite and put the machine where it was required.",1

"I am absolutely sick to death with Vodafone, I have been with them for over 15 years now first for mobile and more recently for broadband. I am sick to death of their idiotic, wanna be big shot sales people lying and b*llshit$ing me over deals. Just been reeled back in to a broadband contract after cancelling due to ongoing terrible internet connection, only to find out that the very offers given to me as an enticement are were in fact nothing but misleading nonsense - promises of going onto fibre within the next few months, next day, 'sorry we cannot give any such promises"", ""well only yesterday, you did precisely that"" and being given quick ( the very reason I'm talking to them after being messed around by another company) installation dates that turn out to be 2 weeks down the line. I have had to take Vodafone to the ombudsman in the past (I won) over the very same issues with their staff giving completely mis leading information. Their staff are cowboys who untimely lie to customers to get them to sign up for offers they then go back on hoping people will just go along with it. Terrible, terrible service from this company on multiple occasions over many years. Get your S**t together Vodafone.",0

"Use these crooks at your own peril!

Through my mobile provider, I changed from an iPhone 12 Pro Max (128GB, Graphite) to an iPhone 14 Pro Max. When I initially checked Mazuma's price for this, it was ¬£500. I had to wait 3-4 weeks for the 14 to arrive, by which time Mazuma's offer had dropped to ¬£465, which I accepted. Fair enough! You expect that when a new model arrives.
So, it was arranged that DPD would collect the old phone, which they did. The following day I received an email from Mazuma stating there was a problem. I called them and they said there were scratches on the phone, which I disputed, and they were now offering ¬£375. The phone was absolutely mint! It had been in a case with glass and camera protectors since I had had it, which I removed, checked it and cleaned. I sent it back in the original box, with the unused cable and SIM tray tool. The only way you would have known this was not brand new was that the seal on the box was cut from when I originally opened it. Mazuma said they would send photos the following morning, which they did not. Even had they bothered to send pictures, there was no way I could prove otherwise (I should have taken photos of the phone alongside the collection receipt when DPD collected it. Who proceeded to place the iPhone box in a large plastic, padded container, and sealed it with a couple of cable ties). Ultimately, I had no proof the phone was in mint condition so I accepted the ¬£375.
Trust these crooks at your own peril! If you do decide to use them, make sure you have evidence of the condition of your phone. They don't even warrant 1 star, but that's the lowest you can give.",0
"I have been with virgin media for 19 years.

3. Phoned up to cancel contact how hard could that be.
Spent 50 minutes on a call I told them to call me back which they did twice . So frustrating.
Somebody looking into changing the cost of my package and he comes back with ¬£68 What a joke.
Ask if he could just close my contract with virgin he told me he could not do that and would have to transfer me to some to do that , they come on the phone and try to change my package. They really know how to test your patience.

So I bit the bullet and messaged them online for them to tell me they couldn‚Äôt find why I was being charged and I have to cancel payments via my bank, which , I have to dispute with now tv first... back to square one!

"When purchasing my phone at Carphone Warehouse Guisley I was advised that, if I signed up for a month to month contract with Vodafone, I would receive a substantial discount on the purchase price.

While this was correct, I was also informed that I would be tied into the contract for a single month if I called immediately on the start date.

When I called Vodafone as instructed I was informed that the information I had been given was incorrect and I could only cancel with Carphone Warehouse.

I called Carphone Warehouse to be informed that they could not cancel my contract until the last day of the month's contract, meaning that I will have to pay for two months of contract.

I would not have signed up had I been given correct information as the discount after paying two months subscription is insufficient to justify the time it has taken and will yet take.

I did not ask for a contract. I was sold a contract. I was sold it with false information both when the contract could be cancelled and the method of cancellation.

I am not at all pleased to have been put to this inconvenience.",0
Simple to order. Rapid delivery. Great customer service from delivery team.,1
"The idea of being able to buy a day, week or month pass is on the face of it amazing, I really liked the idea of hand picking individual games or weeks of sport without going into a full contract and as a football fan I would be ablate ignore the off season and lack of sport to appeal to me. I bought a few day and week passes with no issues until last month when I bought a month pass, little did I know that NOW TV renew these passes without your permission and you physically have to cancel the pass or end up in a subscription.

HOWEVER, it gets worse, I read reviews here and cancelled my pass prior to it expiring, NOW TV however allegedly didn't receive my cancellation and renewed the pass a couple of days after cancelling it, as soon as the money left my account I contacted them through online chat to be told I couldn't get a refund! After many emails I finally gave up and claimed the money back through my bank.
I will NEVER use this company again, they renew set passes without your permission and hold on to your money, you can't close the account so I have blocked all further payments.",0
"Ordered, delivered, fitted, worked. Simple",1
Great choice and prices and a real bargain with the free delivery,1
BT cancelled my account for no reason mid-contract. They had no idea why it had happened. Their only solution was to sign me up again as a customer which involved 14 days without the internet.,0

I was offered alternative colours but I do not want an alternative, I want the colour I had in the first place.
I already know what the terms & conditions state regarding colour availability, but do not really expect such a large company to have no stock whatsoever, and to be told nobody is sure when more stock will be coming in.

"Been with BT for years and had no problems until now, I have recently moved home and also run an online business from home so having an internet connection is of paramount importance! Unfortunately BT mislead me into believing that the connection would be up and running by Monday 24th and this still isn‚Äôt the case! If I knew that it wouldn‚Äôt be up and running by then I would have made alternative arrangements but now unfortunately I need to stay in the property to accommodate for works to be done and furniture to be dropped off! After numerous phone calls to and from and claims that they can not get an engineer out until they see fit as it doesn‚Äôt fit nicely with their SLA even though they promised a one today (Tuesday 25th) they keep telling you what you want to hear and keep delaying the process! Now I have logged a complaint and asked to speak with a manager and they haven‚Äôt responded! I have no idea what‚Äôs going on and currently can‚Äôt work on my business which is impacting my livelihood! The best way to describe BT is as a bunch of unorganised, mis leading cow boys! These guys have cost me ¬£¬£¬£ already because of their inactions! If I had a choice I wouldn‚Äôt touch these guys again with a barge pole but unfortunately they run the monopoly when it comes to broadband in the area so I am left with no alternative but to use this damn right awful company!",0

"I bought a TV and paid for next-day delivery, the next day I got a message saying my delivery had been delayed. More than a week later still haven't received any updates or estimated delivery date.

"I had NOW broadband in a rented flat for 5 months without any real issues, however, when I bought a place and went to move, that was a different story.

I gave them 2 weeks notice as required and was told that on my move in day, the broadband would be connected and working, which is great as 99% of the time I work from home.
However, the morning of my move, the engineer cancelled. NOW TV blamed the BT engineer and the BT engineer blamed NOW TV, as I had requested an afternoon service and the had booked a morning one.
So, I basically had no broadband. I then realistically had to take a days holiday on the Monday to try sort this out and NOW broadband told me that they could get an engineer booked in 12 days time, which I told them was unacceptable.
Luckily on the Monday I managed to pay for and connect to a BT WiFi hotspot for 5 days (which I then had to again5 days later).
Eventually 12 days later, my broadband was up and in one of NOW's emails, there was a link for Ofcom‚Äôs automatic compensation scheme.
I called NOW and made then aware that I was only looking to get back the 2 x ¬£19.99 I had paid.
After chasing for nearly 2 weeks, they have basically offered me the equivalent of ¬£1 per day.
When I told them I wanted to cancel, they then told me I would have to pay an early redemption fee as the broadband speed is good.
So to stop me being out of pocket, I am taking my holiday back and my company are going to invoice them for the days work I missed because of them *which is significantly more that my annual subscription)..
Probably get nothing back, as their customer service abysmal, atrocious, disgusting, horrific and 100% an utter disgrace.

DO NOT by NOW products... you have been warned !",0
"Brandbassador is a great app for influencers and brands to connect and collaborate on marketing campaigns. It's easy to use and has a lot of useful features.

One of the things I really like about Brandbassador is the dashboard, which gives you a clear overview of your campaigns, earnings, and tasks. It's also great that you can easily track the performance of your campaigns and see how much traffic and sales they're generating.

Overall, I highly recommend Brandbassador for anyone looking to work with brands as an influencer or for companies looking to work with influencers. It's a great tool that makes it easy to manage campaigns and build partnerships",1

"UNBELIEVABLE
Vodafone customer service 100% incompetence and ignorance üëé
I called Vodafone to transfer my bill payment by direct debit from my personal bank account to my business bank account. this was a mistake on my part, not knowing how clumsy and/or ignorant they are. Later, after a few days, I checked in the bank application of my business account and it actually shows a new direct debit from vodafone, and I thought everything was in order, so I canceled the old direct debit. But it was not like that . As with any large corporation that respects itself and has competent employees who do their job, you would think that they would take the money on the invoice from the set direct debit, but it seems they didn't. When I realized that the bills were piling up, I paid personally with the card. But in the meantime, without anyone notifying me properly that I am actually becoming delinquent, they sent my invoices to a debt collection company. If you can believe such a thing.
And now my credit score is affected and the collection agency calls me every day and sends me stressful emails to the max. After calling Vodafone customer service countless times, they tell me how sorry they are, but I probably have to endure the collection agency for another 30 days until it comes out of their system...

Update:
I took the advice of the Vodafone social media team and contacted them on Facebook. And in fact you chat with the same people from customer service but on a different platform.

Vodafone reply is just a marketing strategy and no one will go out of their way to change the unpleasant experience you had .
Well it is what it is , just need to wait for the contract to end and take my number to EE , according to the Trust pilot reviews they are a bit better ‚Ä¶ so I am happy to try",0

"Virgin media think that they can treat you like a piece of poo.

Awful customer service after waiting 5 weeks for my washer to be fixed or replaced they sent a engineer who must of been having a bad day huffing and puffing The minute he came in had parts for one of the repairs the other he didn't and didn't even fit the parts he did have I asked him when it would be fixed and if it was possible really rude ignored me so I asked for his details name and business as he was third party completely ignored me and went to his van so we followed and tried to wave for his attention he then told team know how I had threatened him That was not true I simply asked do his details and he swerved his van at me ! I have proof of this but team know how have said they take the workers side .disgusting so after paying ¬£500 over the years no repairs they've cancelled my insurance so am now down ¬£500 and no washer after calling non stop for 5 weeks wouldn't trust them with my life awful,0
From start of initial call to battery collection arranged and replaced within 5 days was truly impressive.Adam & co are awesome at giving precise information and very friendly.Thank you for the great service.,1
"good presentation, quality printing and fast delivery",1
The guys were very friendly Ian kep me up to date all the way till he got to my daughters door once the got there they were very helpful took the washing machine straight into my daughters kitchen he gave her all the instructions what to do with it once she got it out the packing then when he lef hers he called me to let me know it was safely delivered as it was me whose name is on receipt as o purchased it he then gave instructions on what to do when it came out packing so that was so good of him that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve given 5 stars,1
"I've used PIB before, it's always easy. I had a little problem with my software installation but it was soon sorted by the helpline.
My only complaint is not with the PIB but with the software itself (from Harrison). The software I paid for and downloaded, or so I thought, gave me 2 plugins but the license only covers 1 of them. This left me feeling a little ""ripped off"". Not Plugin Boutiques fault though.",1

"This Bosch tumble dryer was my first purchase from Marks Electrical, and unlikely to be my last! The dryer was competitively priced and the whole purchase experience was stress free with plenty of clear communications. I opted for the delivery only, which was free. The driver and his colleague were polite and helpful. I had laid dust cloths on the floor, and they were happy to trolley the appliance into the utility room. The day before I was given a 2 hour delivery slot early in morning. While the delivery was late by an hour, I was pleased to receive two ETA update messages during the slot even though the revised times were missed! Gave me confidence that the appliance was on the way. Overall, a positive experience. Marks Electrical will be the first retailer I check when I need a new appliance.",1
"Would give no stars if possible. What a frustrating experience once again! Deliveroo refusing, once again, to refund items missing from my order. Is this not stealing? There is actually legislation to protect customers from not receiving goods paid for, but Deliveroo seem to think they are above the law, and operating in plain sight. The owner of this company should be ashamed of himself, or maybe a jail term might be the obvious answer.",0

"Appalling customer service. Don‚Äôt listen to you, clearly not well-trained and pass you from pillar to post without dealing with your query. 2 agents hung up on me and one was listening to music for 2 minutes before realising the call had been connected. 5 phone calls just to cancel, not good enough. Paying almost double with Sky but worth it as their agents have more than 1 brain cell!",0
"A pretty disappointing service to be honest. Both delivery men seemed to have a ‚Äònot bothered‚Äô attitude upon their arrival, seemingly looking for excuses for not doing their job from the word go.

Paid for delivery and installation. Ended up with both appliances left outside of our flat.

No issue with the appliances themselves but when paying extra for a particular service, you would, as a minimum, expect these to be done or at least attempted.",0
"I chose a TV I was interested in, and rang Richer Sounds to ask a few questions. The advisor was extremely helpful and friendly and answered every question I asked. I ordered the TV and was kept up to date with delivery. I had a text in the morning of the delivery giving me a 2 hour window, and then a phone call saying they would be with us in 15 minutes. The drivers carried the TV to where we asked and again, it was a very friendly and efficient service",1

"I have spent hours trying to get the correct tariff/agreed package price applied to my account and this has (I believe) now been applied to the account. Appointments agreed and unattended, promises made and not kept - it‚Äôs not been good. On and off, ever since I went with Virgin for the first time, I have been trying to get a pair of extenders as the speed of the WiFi is good but it doesn‚Äôt cover the whole house. I still haven‚Äôt got them. The latest explanation I was given as to why this wasn‚Äôt possible is that I had to wait until the new tariff had been applied before I could get them although I fail to see how the two things are linked. Would it be possible to get this done?",0

"Internet connection has been abysmal despite having two engineers try to fix it. Was wrongly charged ¬£120 one month. And took 2 hours on hold and BT hanging up the call three times until it was finally resolved!
BT has been really really poor since it was installed two years ago. They sent an engineer out last year when lock down eased up after months of failed connection whilst trying to home school and work from home. Engineer said the external wire they had installed the previous year (only months earlier) had completely rusted. They said the issue wasnt my fault and i also wouldn‚Äôt have to pay for the internet that month as i had had over six months of either zero or poor connection. Instead.. i was charged ¬£120 that month?! Internet has still been poor since then (often 1mb if im lucky when i was told minimum would be 35mb and i pay for 40mb) we don‚Äôt use many devices and it often struggles to work when im just answering emails. I dont live in a rural area either. They sent another engineer out this week. When looking through my account I realised I had been wrongly charged the ¬£120 from september last year (months after the engineer had even been out) I hadnt realised at the time as we had a family member pass away that month and my mind was elsewhere. Took me 2 hours (and BT disconnecting my call 3 times) until i finally got through to a nice man who apologised profusely and was able to finally sort it out. The first girl was really quite rude and blatantly just hung up after asking me to wait for 40 mins. I thought maybe the line had disconnected but when it happened three times with other people i realised that wasnt the case. What an unpleasant way to deal with paying customers who are being polite and waiting patiently? To have to be on hold for 2 hours and deal with 7 different people to rectify an error on their behalf is really poor. What a poor service except for the nice man at the end who finally helped me get my money back and refused to put me on hold because i said id been hung up on by the company three times!",0

Extremely disappointing service. Tumble drier on top of washing machine and two men - one strapping Guy- can‚Äôt lift it down to change washing machine over? Really?

Standard response each time refund not received ‚Äòcurrent situation is causing payment delays‚Äô!!!
I definitely would NOT recommend this company - stay clear of them.

Quick Mobile Fix have replied to this post with a standard please get in touch with us message - I have been in regular contact (only contactable via email) and nothing has made any difference in us obtaining a refund for a phone order which was cancelled weeks ago!",0

I got the Samsung galaxy s21fe in olive green and it was delivered the next day! I wanted the white but this may have taken a week or 2 more, so it was my choice!
My plan had no upfront cost, so I am yet to receive the bill later this month. Thry are very good at emailing you to keep you updated and are very transparent the first bill may be a little higher for the extra few days",1

"I had a somewhat stressful start to the beginning of a new Contract, which I was informed had activated on the 26 October. I telephoned Customer Services on the 25 November after noticing my DD had been charged as per the old Contract of ¬£25.00 plus an extra 2.49 for the months November and December, whereby the new 18 month Contract upgrade should have been three free months together with a router, followed by ¬£23.99 per month. I was told by Ian in the Retention Department that my new system was ""stuck"" in the system! I realised why my speeds were slow! He said he would sort it immediately and email me with the details. I did not receive anything but that eveniing my broadband and internet dropped out every fifteen minutes and continued doing this right through Friday night, Saturday the phone also stopped working finally culminating in the entire system not working at all. At this stage I became more upset as I wear an emergency response pendant owing to my disability, of course this will not work without my home phone line. I telephoned Shell from my mobile (using my mobile data) on Monday28 November and thought I was fortunate to speak with a kind and efficient lady from Customer Services, Rozia Kahur, who confirmed the Contract was ""stuck"" in the system and the extra chares of ¬£2 49 each for November and December were probably the postal charge for the router. I was surprised at that as I uderstood from Vicky in Cancellations, who set up the original upgrade Contract on the 11 October, that there was no charge for the router as my original Post Office router was not suitable.. Even if there was a charge for postage, it should have only been ¬£4.50 once according to your Terms. However, she was amazing and spent a very long time testing everything with me to find the fault, (over 2 hours) which was found to be to do with the telephone line and the Shell technical engineers were having problems installing the fibre for my new Contract (hence the speed problems I am having) She told me there is also a fault on the line and needed an Engineer to visit. She told me she would arrange an Engineer to visit as a priority starting the morning of 30th between the hours of 8am until 1pm maybe extending through 1st and 2nd of December depending what the fault is and what is needed.
I was pleased for the opportunity to deal with Rozia, who proved to be so competent and very pleasant, helpful. I am only hopeful that there is no further delays in relation to the Contract paperwork updating or the engineering work on tge fibre or phone line to get my system working efficiently as I am disabled and rely on my emergency response working for my safety.
FOLLOW UP
30th November and
1st December No contact so far from an Engineer. Rang Shell (Joanne) Told her still no working system. She told me Rozia had not ticked the box to indicate I am an emergency pendant user!! Therefore I am not a priority customer. She told me I just have to wait.
FOLLOWUP
2nd December Still no contact from Engineer nor Shell Customer Sevices *** 8 days today since my first call to Shell on 25 November reporting incorrect billing followed by my system outage. Still no service despite being disabled and wear an emergency response pendant!! . I am now going to cancel my Contract which was only from 26 October!! Since then speed not fibre plus, intermittent outage then totally failed 8 days ago. Cannot use my emergency response in an emergency.
UPDATE As I have not heard from an Engineer nor Shell at all and my system and phoneline is still down completely, at 1.20 today I rang Shell spoke to Ahmed and told him to cancel my Contract as it seems that they are unable to honour the Contract which has proved not fit for purpose. He cancelled but did not confirm it by email. Just said I would receive a final bill. I told him that as the Contract was not activated when I rang on the 25th November and has not worked, I made it clear I did not expect to receive cancellation charges!!
After cancelling on the 2 December, I received a text on the 3 December saying an engineer would be visiting me on the 7 December!!! What happened to the booked visit on the 30 November?!! Huge disappointment with this Company. I would not have cancelled if they had communicated with me by phone in relation to the delays and mishaps n activating my Contract. Incidentally I never received any communication as mentioned by Sara's reply to my review!!!",0

"Despite all of the anecdotal reports from friends I've heard about how bad Virgin are, I was still enticed by their Black Friday offers... I feel quite silly now!

Signed up for a TV, Fibre and O2 SIM package. Site was very buggy - 'sorry we're experiencing issues' sort of errors when trying to submit my details for the order online, took me about 10 attempts to complete the order (that should have been enough of a warning right there, an ISP/media company can't even keep their own site operating properly).

Finally 'completed' the order, but the confirmation said we need to be in touch about it before it could be processed - so I called them and spent a few hours understanding why they are such a horrendous company to detail with...

Offshore customer service telling me that the O2 SIM package I had added to the Virgin package order online wasn't available to new customers, the one I ordered would cost me more. They are totally clueless reading off a script. After an hour of trying to sort it out, I finally realized how bad it would be to sort anything out with them technically, nevermind a simple online order, so asked to just cancel it - only an hour into the 14 day cooling-off period, shouldn't be an issue, right? Wrong... Several phone calls, asking 5+ with very clear language to CANCEL, they just pretend you didn't say it - ABSOLUTELY UNREAL!!

Dropped calls, and several callbacks later they've said it's cancelled, so lucky escape, but given how terrible they are I sort of don't believe it.

Also they had to transfer me to O2 to ask them to cancel any SIM from the Virgin order because basically they couldn't be sure I wouldn't be signed up for O2 despite them supposedly cancelling everything on their side.

Compare it to Sky who I was going to switch from (now definitely staying put) - called them asking about obligations for getting out of their contract inside cooling off period (I'm not a serial switcher, we just moved into a new place and wanted the fastest setup without having to fit the full Fibre connection to the house). They were super helpful, fully clear exactly what dates we would need to let them know by, any costs, giving us best options to ensure we would not be without internet etc while moving over.

"There was nothing good about my experience whatsoever. I was never kept up to date about my laptop that was in for repair. Even when there was a delay on returning it to me, all I had was a text that the delivery was cancelled and they were working on repairing it still. I never once had a phonecall updating me. I had to call in constantly to get updates and wait in the queue for an hour each time to get useless information about my laptop. I was never given a proper update. When I did get the call to say my laptop was fixed from the engineer, I tried to ask questions about what was wrong with my laptop and he was rushing to get off the phone. Now, I have received my laptop and the lid has been scratched twice and there are dents on the back. I called and they said that there was already a scratch on the lid when they received it meaning that this will have been done in transit as my laptop has had no scratches as I look after it very well. They will collect it from me today but if this is not fixed, I will have to take it further. Poor customer service throughout.",0

"From placing an order to down grade halo 1 Full fibre to the property, and cancelling within an hour as the sales person could not tell me about the price increase until the order date had been approved.
They turned off my landline without permission to do so, I have spent approximately 8-9 hours being on hold and being given the old BT promise we will sort it out book an engineer to reconnect at the exchange.
Here is the best part, They cancelled all my services behind my back and said nothing more we can do, you can phone sales tomorrow and take out a new contract.
Wow and they own EE what can I expect after being a loyal customer for in excess of 15 years, when my contract runs out.
Shocking treatment of customers they went above and beyond this time,

I had sent my phone to them for a trade in at an agreed price, and they emailed me and lied that my phone is ""non working due to a screen burn"", even though my phone was working perfectly fine and had absolutely no screen burn or any damage. They won't reply to my emails and there is no direct contact number to speak to anyone about this issue other than the customer service team, who are unhelpful.

It's appalling, we had no internet for 6 weeks due to your inconsideration for addressing customer complaints properly, you display wrong speed information in order to push away complaints due to you being able to say ""on our end, everything seems fine on our end"" when in reality it's not and you give false hope to customers boosting their speeds for a week within purchase, then slowly decreasing it to low-level speeds.",0

We phoned AD and this is when the run around started. 3 months later we are still waiting for an engineer to repair it. We phone AD and they fob you off to the contractor. My argument is they supplied the machine, I am their customer, what should I deal with a third party? Anyway repairman due today, organized to be home, sorry can't come, next appointment end of January. This is the worst service I have ever had, worse than Ferroli Boilers and that is saying something. I will never purchase from Appliances Direct again. Their after sales service is very poor.",0

"I have used Carphone Warehouse for the last 4/5 phones, including my sisters and my mother‚Äôs... until this point I was satisfied...HOWEVER I am now very concerned that every single time i have been ripped off on price.

This evening I looked at the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, saw what I thought to be a great deal, 9.99 upfront, ¬£54 a month 75gb etc etc... I have ordered this deal, 2 minutes later I stumble across Mobile Phones Direct, who have EXACTLY THE SAME DEAL for ¬£12 a month cheaper and no upfront cost and the insurance is ¬£6 a month
Cheaper as well.

I am so disappointed that there could be such a big contrast in pricing, I WAS a loyal customer however this break in trust has put me off using Carphone Warehouse again, if mobile phones direct (who are a smaller INDEPENDENT company) can do it for so much less, the upfront cost is clearly unnessary and CPW are just putting ¬£¬£¬£ on top to rip off it‚Äôs customers.

I will be calling at 8am to cancel my order.",0

What's worse when I spoke to him on phone, said both products were on. Then spoke to 3 people on phone saying they don't connect plug products to wired and that I should have asked for integrated installation which isn't an option online, then told I need an integrated product. Didn't offer a refund even though product unusable so had to ask for it. Then tried 3 times to rearrange collection and system was down all day and there ivr is mental, each option seems to have 5 options on 5 options. Took me a few attempts to find the right option.",0

Called up they rush you along and get you off the call, just hung up on me.

I've never wrote reviews and this is the first one because this company has made me feel like trash. I would avoid this company as if anything breaks you will definitely not get a refund because they will find ways to not give you one.",0

Received a text saying the driver was 13 mins away. 50 mins later I called his mobile and it went straight to voicemail. Contacted Argos via the virtual chat where I was told that on the system it said ""delivery failure"". I asked how that could be when I received a text saying matey was on his way to deliver. They couldn't offer an explanation as to why, as there wasn't a note on the system! Clearly the driver couldn't be bothered to answer his phone or make the delivery. Rubbish service so got a refund. Maybe Argos should get delivery drivers who can and want to do their job!!",0
Totally seamless experience. From people who know exactly what they are talking about. It‚Äôs the complete honesty that I admire. Everyone from the delivery driver to my local Hughes shop ( where I had questions ) just seemed so Customer oriented with empathy. Not looking for a quick sell.

Our family has used Vodafone for years and been happy so far. But for my husband's renewal the technical and customer service have been abysmal! It took 3 attempts to retrieve the phone from the shop. But attempts to sign up online for home delivery didn't work either because there was some fault on Vodafone's end. And now a week without a phone line! The new number got cut off but they never managed to get the old number transferred. We've thrown in the towel and gone elsewhere.,0
From start to finish this was a first class service.,1

An actual majority of occasions I've used it have resulted in the food turning up mangled, cold, incomplete, wrong or just not at all, while the driver ticks it off as job done and it's who knows where, then you can't get them to address it or accept fault, if you can even get through to them.

At the time of the switch we were in contact with Pure Planet about an overpayment of ¬£100s. When Shell took over they ignored the whole thing. I have been emailing, phoning and even used Resolver service to sort this, but every new advisor doesn't seem to read any previous correspondence and asks for more readings and more information!! This has taken months now and I have seen no action, I think they just do this to wear people down. I guess the whole company's motto nowadays is ‚ÄúIt is what it is.‚Äù",0
"If I could give them zero stars I would! Bought a laptop in the Black Friday sale and the order was cancelled on Saturday morning. No explanation in the email so I chased it up on chat to find out. The reason it was cancelled was due to ‚Äústock issues‚Äù and the website has not updated accordingly.

Well‚Ä¶. Why would you advertise an item when there is no stock? Yet, it was still marked as IN STOCK for 24 hours after my order was cancelled‚Ä¶ so how many other people ordered it and fell into this trap????

I was told 5 days for a refund. I waited and my money was still not back on the Love2Shop card. I chased Argos on the phone, twitter, Facebook and even asked for an email to raise a formal complaint.
I‚Äôve had no helpful acknowledgment at all. The messaging on their social media is terrible‚Ä¶ you get an auto reply that sends you in circles!!!! When I finally did speak to someone, on the phone, they stated that Love2Shop would be contacted (by Argos) on my behalf to have it investigated. I had to literally PUSH them to do something about it - rather than recite their policy of ‚Äúwaiting five days‚Äù. It had been FIVE (working) days but I wasn‚Äôt prepared to sit all weekend twiddling my thumbs without answers from anyone! Someone has to be accountable?!?! By the way, ARGOS! THATS YOU!

Well, just to be sure, I called Love2Shop who said they‚Äôve seen this as a regular occurrence recently with Argos! People being let down and without their money!!!!! In the phone call, I have to sing and praise Love2Shop! They were amazing and have said they‚Äôd work with me to resolve this as soon as possible. I hope to hear back Monday for an update‚Ä¶ Argos pull your finger out!!!! Give me my money back!!!!

I am disgusted with Argos! Angry! Frustrated!
I have since missed out on other deals!
I am without a laptop I need for my business and cannot purchase another.
Argos haven‚Äôt even apologised as their customer service is non-existent. It is by far the most applauding experience I have ever had to endure! Shame on you Argos for treating your customers like utter crap!!!!!

You‚Äôve lost a customer‚Ä¶ and hopefully this review will serve as a warning to others! Go elsewhere!",0

"Placed an order with Carphone Warehouse online which seemed pretty straight forward. Delivery address was messed up on the system (no fault of mine) and when trying to change it this is when the problems started! I spoke to various different advisors (me contacting them every single time as nobody in the company seems to want to call you back. Also they have a very bad phone line and you can hardly hear or understand a word they are saying!) and not one of them knew what was happening or could tell me the same story. One advisor told me that the order needed to be cancelled and re-ordered online, another told me that I did NOT need to cancel and re-order, they would speak with the I.T team and have the issue resolved within 24 hours and then another told me that as it has taken them so long to try and sort this mess out my credit check had expired and they needed to re-run it! I refused this as I don't want lots of credit checks going against my name (especially when it is not my fault they have taken so long), so they told me I had to contact Vodafone myself (more running around and wasting time for me!) and ask for them for an account number which would help them use the first credit check. I called Vodafone and explained everything I was told and the advisor at Vodafone did not know what they was asking for and was very confused by the whole situation. I then went back to Carphone Warehouse and explained to them that Vodafone did not know what they was requesting and the advisor at C/Warehouse was very confused why they didn't understand. I did suggest instead of making me, the customer, doing all the running around maybe it would be nice if they stepped in and gave me a little help, but they didn't seem to want to. In the end, I have requested the order to be cancelled and my up front cost to be refunded to me. I have been advised, to do this I need to call them back in 72 hours with a ref number I have been provided as the order is down as invoiced! Not sure why when I haven't received anything but trouble from them. I did ask why somebody couldn't call me and they said sorry this just isn't possible, and they will be able to process the refund and then I SHOULD receive my up front cost back. I am not hopeful that the cancellation process is going to be smooth at all after the dreadful service I have received at the moment. Fingers crossed it will be the one thing they can get right for me. My advice would be avoid at all costs!",0
"The app often fails to work, with no explanation. When it does work the quality is often poor. Why doesn't it just work in the browser, like any other streaming service? Also its expensive compared to other options. Honestly I'm confused how it's so bad. It feels like a cheap streaming service, but it costs more...",0
"It couldn't get any worse so yes could improve I made 12 requests for a bag to return equipment still not got it
It took hours to cancel my account too. I cancelled it as the engineers didn't come. You ask me for the date of my experience it's been going on every few days for nearly 2 months staff saying no problem I will do that but they don't do wat they have promised to do",0
"Ordered online. 2 weeks later, no sign of the order, no response from courier or ghd. Missed my partner's birthday. hopeless. I cannot express my rage to a fleshy human, the only avenue for my futile venting is a review form that will probably be processed by an AI unless it contains weird keywords like phlegm, placenta and nachos.",0
"Took out a free 2 week home 4G/5G broadband trial - ABSOLUTELY UNUSABLE, despite being able to see their mast out of the window. Cancelled within a week of the 2 week trial.

Took 2 months to get them to send out an equipment return envelope (mandatory, despite a Three shop is 5 mins walk away), meanwhile receiving daily phone calls and letters demanding payment for a service I never had (it was a free trial, and cancelled well within stated terms)

Months more later and I still receive daily calls, letters and threats to involve debt collectors and escalating fees that even THEIR OWN CUSTOMER SERVICE agrees (over at least 10 different chat sessions) I should NOT be receiving, the account is closed, I owe nothing and I should ignore.

Every single call ends with them assuring me the account is closed and settled, and every time the calls and letters just continue the next day. I am at the point of thinking of having a lawyer write a cease and desist letter for harassment.

Irrespective of the price or service you manage to get out of them, TRUST ME, it's not worth the hassle you will get just trying to leave.

The company (or at least its internal relationship with its debt recovery wing) is completely dysfunctional, the extent you wonder if it's actually a deliberate form of extortion to make you pay money YOU DON'T OWE just to make them leave you alone.

Pity, because I was previously a very happy mobile customer for many years. Would never use again now though, and actively discourage anyone else. Probably the worst customer experience (outside of actual fraud) that I've ever had.

UPDATE: Just received another email, this time telling me a credit agency has now been employed to recover this (non existent) debt. I received a reply from Three to this review urging me to contact them: it just went back to exactly the same customer service line I had been speaking to all along who repeated the same platitudes - time will tell if this time it's resolved.

As a gesture of goodwill I was offered ¬£35 of PAYG credit, which is something (though I had to ask for it)

If the issue actually *is* resolved and I hear no more I will update the star rating.",0
Josh & Simon delivered my integrated dishwasher. Rung to notify they would be early which was perfect for me. Simple order process and NDD available. The men were polite and asked where I wanted the item left. Took care not to bump into anything in the property. Explained I had 48 hours to remove packaging and check item. Happy to deal with this company again and would recommend to anyone. Thank you!,1
"This is the second system I've purchased from PCSpecialist. The first one was a system for our daughter as a gift when she got her 1st home.
I was impressed by the quality of the build, the packaging, and swift delivery.
So, when our son was looking for a gaming rig, my first thought was PCSpecialist again.
Their website was perfect for allowing us to try out different specs for his rig, and warning us if any component choices were mismatched. That meant we were then getting a rig's spec that suited his requirements perfectly. (which is what you want when spending c.¬£3,000)
The PC was delivered in time for Xmas, perfectly packaged, including internal packaging within the PC casing itself.
He is now happily running his hi-spec, SUPER quiet gaming rig.
If you're looking for PC or laptop build, give them a try.
You won't be disappointed.",1
Great service easy to locate the part you need and speedy delivery. Thank you.,1
"Terrible. You think when you pay for insurance that this covers anything to do with phone repairs
Was informed sometimes an excess fee is charged, which is ok, but upon contacting the team by phone I was informed there was no fee. Upon collecting my phone a fee was demanded.
Tried to converse with the team and they are basically calling me a liar and say their rep never said there would be no fee- it was the last thing said in the phone call. Absolute joke. As well pissing money against the wind. Money charged could have been used to fix the phone on my own accord, not to mention the money WASTED each month. Have canceled the policy now so won‚Äôt have to deal with their bullsh*t again. Lucky to get one star.",0
"It took hrs to sort out a missed call, I've been waiting 10 days for a repair then the call was a postponed visit.
The person on the phone kept me on hold for 15mins then cut me off I rang again same thing kept on hold then when the woman came bk all she did is yourn the whole time then cut off again.
Rang a third time took a while but sorted.
Only the fact that the call centre was in India is a disgrace it should be in the UK found it difficult to understand a lot of what was being said I don't think I will use Currys in future to much hassle I will find a company that is UK based for after care .",0
"Very unhappy with recent contract renewal. I have been a customer of Vodaphone since they launched so 20+ years? maybe more. With my latest upgrade/ renewal they wanted details such as ""income & outgoings"", how long have I lived at my address etc & they performed a hard search which now shows on my credit report. They excuse this as down to FSA rules but surely this should not apply to long term customers who clearly already have an unblemished record which I do. I'm very unimpressed by this & cannot see any reason why I should have been subjected to this!",0
"The process of ordering our individuly printed name cards was very straightforward on the website.
The order was delivered within the timescale stated and the quality was excellent with all 89 cards printed perfectly and we also received 10 extra blank cards which we had not ordered free of a charge.

Well done Optimalprint!",1

"Plenty of choice on the website. Unfortunately I chose wrongly, I put two designs in my basket. I should have chosen the other one. I didn't size the font correctly either and ended up with a very difficult invitation to read, hey ho that is my fault.Future customers please note this when designing your card/invitation. I think that will teach me not to do things like this on my phone!!. That however is my problem not yours. Your customer service did exactly what it said on the tin. Communication was good, I had been kept informed throughout the dispatch/delivery process. I would highly recommend this company. Thank you for such good value cards/invitations especially the self seal envelopes. 5* Service.",1
"I had taken out the extended warranty with appliances direct for my new kitchen appliances. Just over a year later my oven stopped working, after nearly 6 weeks without an oven the warranty service provider agreed it needing replacing from appliances direct. I then had to chase appliances direct for the replacement several times, little did I know how much it would cost me. Received my phone bill, ¬£42 for 2x 30min phone calls, 25 min of those being on hold! 1. I shouldn‚Äôt have to chase for my replacement 2. Change your phone line to free call! Disgusting. Suggest you send me a cheque to refund for the call costs.",0

"This review is soley for IZZY in Poland. She was the only person seemingly able and indeed willing to look in the totally inaccurate billing and credit control lies and mistakes that annihalated my credit rating. She was kind and supportive when I lost all hope that these inaccuracies would ever allow me to help my family. The late payment marker was withdrawn after she investigated my claims of previous payment all due to me asking for a prepament meter to be installed. She rang and emailed me to ensure I was alright and when things started to go right she ensured I was aware of it. Thanks IZZY. You are a diamond!.
Billing....take a leaf out of this ladies book.",1
One of the worst streaming services to ever exist. Constantly buffers and extortionate prices. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend to even my worst enemy.,0
Available and super quick delivery of item when it was sold out in most other places. Allowed the unit to stand for 24 hrs as instructed. Turned it on and so far so good. Can already see the condensation on the windows receding. Need more time to be more confident. Straight forward control panel. Sleek looking appearance.,1
"Absoulte shocking. Rang them up because my tv is on its way out. One bloke sounded like he just woke up from bed and give me another number to ring. After speaking to some1 after ages of trying different ways to get in touch they said it take up to 7 days to fix my tv. But il be with out the tv for 7 days also. And if the tv is written off il have a voucher. So plus working all the time i got to hope the voucher covers the tv of the similar spec or put money towards the tv and somehow use a voucher? Easter holidays. My boy is home, no TV for 7 days. Covid was the excuse. But they can collect the tv, but not drop 1 of for us to use for 7 days which the agreement plan was. Reason why is because they would have to basically deep clean the tv. So if my tv goes off to some strangers to have some work done and one of those engineers have covid, will they deep clean my tv before bringing it back? Its a scam. You paying this money and they got no intention of helping you. None at all. Save the money your selfs and purchase a new tv.. never use team knowhow, because they don't knowhow to deal with customers or run a business they a scam.

Oh and by the way. I havnt asked them to come fix my tv because I'm going to either have to buy 1 first or borrow one. 7 days I a long time",0
"Issues for over 4 months. Engineers sent out. Problem is still there. Overpaying for a service Im not receiving. Phoned up, 7 hours on the phone over 2 days, customer reps are literally the worst reps I've ever experienced. Transferred me over 17 times over 2 days. Was promised I'd be transferred to the manager I'd requested to talk about leaving, transferred to business instead just to get rid of me. Was told I'd get a manager call back on Monday, they call on Thursday. He confirmed we can finally leave without paying the exit fee. Transferred to a member of staff that's been working there for a day. He transfers us to billing. She tells us this is the wrong place and they can't help. BT uses classic caravan tactics of misdirection until you give up and they move on. If you're unlucky enough to have any issues whatsoever, that's game over. Avoid BT like the plague.",0

I have used capitals to highlight not shout or out of anger.

"Without exaggeration, BT has got to be the worst company in the world to deal with. We have had no internet now for nearly three weeks. We live rurally so that means no mobile phones either. You can never speak to anyone, if you do all you get is well rehearsed, well written platitudes when you know they couldn‚Äôt care less and nothing gets resolved. I keep being told the problem is different things - there is no consistency and the worst part is that they keep saying it will be fixed in 24hrs, 48hrs, etc. Needless to say, no fixes. You then have to start the contact all over again and explain things from the beginning which is infuriating for a problem that has been going on for several weeks now. Dealing with foreign call centres does not help either. It really is a test of endurance and I don‚Äôt know if this will ever be resolved. In the meantime, of course, they are happy to keep charging you for a non existent service!",0

Waited less than 90 seconds to allow someone to answer door then had the cheek to laugh yes laugh and say if you had got to door two seconds earlier I would not have closed the job. When infact Customer not at fault if he had arrived 3.5 hrs earlier on time, or communicatted he was going to be late; no courtesy. part on van but need to wait until 6/2/23 as part out of stock ??? Needed to be ordered makes no sense Contacted D&M not all interested, Customer services don't deal with complaints. But can log a complaint through chat on Facebook from my perspective that is called sweeping it under the carpet. I have been a customer for over 10 years very very disappointed and saddened by lack of response and accountability.",0
"I heard Carphone warehouse could beat my network provider (EE) for upgrade, which they did on the phone. However, they told me that it would be ‚Äúbetter‚Äù to open a new contract. I didn‚Äôt have a preference, so long as I could keep the number that I‚Äôve had for 10 years. I was told it was my responsibility to cancel the existing contract, and when I asked further about this, as I was concerned about keeping my existing number, I was told I just needed to request a PAC code from EE and my number would be transferred across. That was fine by me, it was made clear to me it was an easy process.

Obviously (as I now know) that‚Äôs not what happened because for some ridiculous reason, in 2019 you can‚Äôt transfer numbers between contracts on the same network. You have to get a pay and go SIM on a new network, port your number across there, and then after 30 days, port it back - I can‚Äôt be without my existing phone number for 30 days, and nor should I have to pay for a new pay and go sim. I wasn‚Äôt told any of this at point of sale (and had no reason to already know about the number transfer, as I‚Äôve always just upgraded rather than opened a new contract) so Carphone Warehouse completely mid-sold this to me. I will be returning the phone within the 14 days cooling off period and will upgrade directly with EE.

If you do decide to go with Carphone Warehouse, make sure you ask loads of questions and fully understand what they are doing. I suspect opening a new contract was probably only beneficial to the sales representative, who probably only gets commission for ‚Äúnew‚Äù contracts rather than upgrades. Particularly since they matched what EE were offering me in an upgrade - it wasn‚Äôt a better deal than I could get via upgrade.",0

"I bought a brand new Samsung Television from Curry's at West Quay Southampton at the beginning of November and 2 months later there's a hardware failure.

As I hadn't bought Curry's Tech Support add on, the only help staff in store would give me is to direct me to Samsung Tech support, who still haven't fixed the issue.

What happened to companies having faith in their own product? Curry's don't seem to trust what they sell. Why else charge for tech protection on top of the price of the product. It's as if they are saying ""we don't know if it'll work, so give us extra money and we'll protect you"".

While I appreciate Currys don't manufacture their own goods, as a vendor they have a responsibility to their customer and should be prepared to help them instead of sending them on their way. I certainly feel taken for granted, if not ripped off.",0
"Got the ""Problem with your Order / Sorry we have had to amend your sale"" email for a perfectly good iPhone 11. Problems with scratches 'apparently' around the case to the phone which was enshrined in a strong otterbox rubber case. Ditto the back panel which is 'apparently' chipped, despite the same otterbox case, and also the screen which 'apparently' has multiple scratches despite having previously been fitted with a Belkin glass screen protector. I will need to get my wife to cut her nails! Completely disingenuous damage assessment received from Mazuma which is disappointing and can only lead me to one conclusion. I'll let you draw your own conclusion to what that may be.",0
The coverage is good and their support staff are excellent but keeping a Pay-As-You-Go data service going was wasting too much of my time. This may be intended to encourage people to take out a contract but in my case I decided I didn't want a contract with a company that can't cope with even a relatively simple transaction. I didn't want to 'enjoy' three as a service provider - the less I have to deal with a service provider the more I'm going to like it. I am actually sorry for the people at Three who are trying to provide a good service in the face of something that simply doesn't work - at least for me.,0

"The app works ok and there are some programmes worth watching, but...

The free trial is a con, no other way to describe what the company is doing. Promoting a free trial membership on an individual programme-level leads users to believe that the type of membership they are signing-up for is the one needed to watch that programme, at no time is the fact that users are actually signing-up to three types of membership, all charged separately.

The company will offer to refund the pro-rata amount for the payment if the user writes to complain. Even if you write immediately upon noticing the charge, this means they will get to keep 54p of the mid-led payment. This must have totalled tens of thousands of pounds profit, at least.

Perhaps they should get the user experience team to focus on improving the usability of the app (which is poor) instead of designing what is basically a scam.",0

"I bought a Dolce Gusto Mini Me Automatic Coffee Machine on 25/05/2021 and paid extra for a small kitchen appliance insurance which Very.co.uk used to sell on their website.
The coffee machine stopped working weeks ago, so I contacted Very's customer service on 06/12/2022 as I paid for the additional insurance I thought this will be easily sorted, however I was wrong. After being on hold for over 30 minutes with Very's customer service I was told Very will not honour the insurance even though I provided them the details. I was also tol by the Very agent that I should contact the supplier Krups who should cover the 2 years appliance international guarantee, and if Krups agree then I should also contact again Very customer services of the next steps of replacement which doesn't even make any sense.

I wrote to Very on the same date as my call and made a written complaint on 06/06/2022 and provided evidence of purchase and insurance, to this date I still have not received any response from Very.

I also contacted Krups UK customer services and was told to contact Dolce Gusto's customer service on the phone or online. As I would like to keep written evidence I have contacted Dolce Gusto via email and waiting to hear back from them.

I find it rather frustrating that Very doesn't honour their small kitchen appliance insurance and being passed from pillar to post. After this experience I will not purchase any other items from Very.",0

"Ordered a mattress topper online for collection instore, Argos were happy to accept order (and Payment) but then no acknowledging email.
Web site showed order was being processed, but then 9 hours later received email ""advise that the Fast Track order you recently placed was not successful "", then have the cheek to only offer refund after 7 days.
MAkes their current TV ads farcical, doesn't it!

19/12/22 Still awaiting refund promised (in 7 days!)
Tried their Chat.. useless, transferred to their Twitter Argos Helpers. got Thanks. ""We'll put you through to the team to help asap."", still waiting 15 minutes to date
GAve up waiting after 30+ minutes.
Is this customer service??
20/12/2022 It gets worse
Got through on chat. Seems order was NOT Cancelled, despite email stating it was, so refund wasn't generated. ""Do you want the order cancelled"" (Stupid Question?) You'll get your refund in 5 days (allegedly). So I've had to wait 30 odd days for a refund for an item on which they accepted my money when they hadn't got it to sell, what a business model!",0

After attempted theft from my bank account last week they have tried again. Claiming I owe for a service I don't have or even requested.
Turns out they even went as far as to ring VISA for my card details to thieve the money. And judging by the great reviews on here, I'm not the only victim of their crime spree.

Luckily the bank is stopping all their transactions but I have no option other than to close that account as a result.

My advise..... dont even give them second thought.",0

"My experience of BT and Openreach. My BT contract was coming to and end, so I decided to upgrade my broadband speed which required an Openreach engineer visit.
1st appointment - Openreach failed to turn up, no call or message. Spoke to BT, said they would call me back the following Monday - they didn't. Had to call back again and 2nd appointment arranged.
2nd appointment - Another no show. Spoke to BT, who contacted Openreach who denied any knowledge of the appointment, even though I had their reference number (A0E6EFEFR). Appointment rearranged again. BT customer services, called me back later to confirm that OpenReach had said 100% that the appontment was made as agreed.
3rd appointment - Another no show by OpenReach and no contact. Called BT back, and OpenReach claim that the appointment is for next week. Notes on my account clearly say it is for today.
Offered another appointment (4th time) for next week. I can't keep staying at home for no show appointments. I have asked BT to cancel my order.

I will say that, other than not being called back once as promised, the BT customer service people were very polite and helpful each time I spoke with them (and the calls took a long time). They seem to also be at the mercy of OpenReach and are having to explain to their customers the very poor service.

"I called on 22 Dec and booked engineer appointment for 28 Dec. I called 3 times on 28 Dec having waited in 8-6pm, and was assured engineer was on his way and would be with me by 6pm. Engineer never showed. Slow communication with D&G followed, promised call backs never happened, eventually got an engineer out to me early January. He was in and out of my house in 7 mins and claimed it was a cleaning issue yet did not have the required brush to test this out and confirm this was the issue. Lo and behold, he left, I did all the cleaning of parts as suggested, tumble dryer still doesn‚Äôt work. I am now back to square 1 with D&G. Also worth noting that during one of my many calls with D&G they mentioned that they don‚Äôt have access to the engineers diary so the date they give you is not worth paper it is written on - they have no idea of engineer is free or not. An absolute farce of a process and once this issue is resolved I‚Äôll be cancelling my D&G insurance for both tumble and washing machine and will pay for my repairs privately and which will no doubt be more efficient.",0

"Here is an honest review, and some advice about how you can obtain a refund quickly:

Like a few have mentioned, I had ordered with QMF a few years ago and had a positive experience. I'm not sure what has happened since (I'm sure COVID isn't helping, but it's no excuse), but this time I placed my order, waited the 7-10 working days, became concerned, sent multiple messages, all to no avail. It was only when I checked Trust Pilot to see if my experience was unique that I realised the extent of the problem.

After receiving no communications from their email, Twitter, or 'live' chat, I emailed to request a cancellation. Interestingly, this was answered after a few days to say that someone from the cancellation team would contact me in 24-48 hours. No surprises, but that was weeks ago and I'm still waiting.

Anyway, here's how I can help. It became pretty obvious that QMF had no intention of sending me a phone or refunding me, so I raised a transaction dispute directly with my bank. You can do it online, and it's really easy (I'm not allowed to post links, but just Google your bank and 'transaction dispute' and it'll take you to the correct page). The bank took their advised 10 working days to process my claim and have since issued me a full refund. I appreciate that this will not help those who have sent in devices for repair, but if like me you placed an order and have been stuck in a communication vacuum for months, it will work.

Don't wait around for QMF; escalate immediately and get your refunds. Good luck everyone.",0

"Truly awful service which is getting worse by the minute. They removed the stream on two devices system and now charge an extra ¬£5 a month for ‚Äòboost‚Äô if you want to continue with a benefit you were already paying for. To cover up this blatant money grabbing from their loyal customers, they glossed it over with ‚Äòyou can now stream on 3 devices and have ad free viewing‚Äô. Well ad free viewing was never an issue before and I only want to stream on two devices so they are essentially ripping their customers off and trying to pass it off as giving us a better service. Forcing them to pay an extra ¬£5 a month when they did not even ask for these extra benefits. I followed through a complaints process with this horrible provider and had a manager named Hozefa managing my case, well, they closed my complaint without even answering my questions and we‚Äôre not even bothered by the fact I was clearly upset and wanted to leave. Their first response to my initial complaint was that ‚Äòthey haven‚Äôt increased the cost to my current package, we have only added benefits‚Äô well, as you can see, this was a blatant lie as I could stream on two devices before but I now have to pay an extra ¬£5 a month for boost to keep that same service? As I mentioned above, they are charging you extra and trying to hide it at the same time with blatant lies. Clearly they have no regard for their clientele and they are more concerned with taking peoples hard earned money than providing them with a decent service. Bear in mind, all of these increases came on the back of a worldwide pandemic, where countless people are earning less or have lost jobs completely. No customer care at all, I have cancelled my subscription and will not be returning, absolutely vile company.",0

They agreed to take it back for their in house 'testing' which you can guarantee will show the battery is fine even though it's obviously not. Im not confident of getting a refund.

Tayna supposedly arranged a collection which hasn't happened so it looks like I'm stuck with a battery in my house over Christmas.

Looking around you can get near enough the same price locally and certainly less hassle to return a faulty battery.

Three have good coverage but you don‚Äôt need to secure their services because the customer service is utterly and completely useless.

"I purchased a HP laptop with a plan, the SD slot broke send it for investigation under my plan, they send it back with not even a note to say they had not fixed it, I had to try my SD card to find out they have done nothing other then sending it back dusty and not even packed and protected while on its way for delivery. I had discovered by ringing them that it was my fault and it is not covered under the plan I had to pay ¬£60 for the Engineer to check again, when engineer checked they came back with a charge of ¬£240, tried to ring the engineer for further information as team know how did not know the answers to my question, 2days and it rings only no one answers. Rang the team back this is my 3rd call from March, I get the answer ""it says the motherboard is damaged on the technicians note and that's the reason for the charge"", so I went ahead and paid it (I would like to state every call is taking me 2hours and I still cant get the right answers) around 3-4days later get my Laptop back quite surprised as they said they need to order the part? again packaging a disgrace, its shows an error on keyboard with black screen when I turn it on, the mouse pad is loose not as it use to be, sealing at the back where they opened it not sealed properly. I must say as well I tried to contact HP as I still have my 1year warranty but they divert me back to them as they are in contract with them, they never checked my 1year warranty with HP only their care plan. I tried to solve this issue since March and I am in May now rang them over 5x with twice they disconnect on purpose as they don't know what to do, they don't want to escalate it to higher up, bad service the worst I ever had from them and this is my first 1star rating.",0

"All I want is to get another contract for my broadband. The person has lied about the costs - the confirmatory email bore no resemblance to the costs quoted on the phone. Also, I said I just wanted to stay the same. Instead, BT has trespassed on my property, installing some cable, which I have tried to pull up and thought about removing with my garden secateurs. They want to install fibre which I do not want. I don't want engineers in my house. I will not let them in. I am so angry and feel so powerless. I am frightened by this all happening without my consent.",0

"What a shame Vodafone has seemingly recently acquired for itself such a poor reputation for customer service if many of these reviews are to be accepted!
And how awful then seems to be the case of the behaviour and culture of the company, including it seems its 'bereavement team's' behaviour to the family of a well-known figure? But how does anyone, who is at all discerning, decide to have or continue to have any sort of personal contract with Vodafone if they are aware of all of these negative reviews and adverse consumer experiences?
A few years ago I looked after my much loved mother who suffered from Alzheimer's and sadly died as a result of that dreadful affliction, maybe at least 10 years 'before her time'. And I then had to deal with all of her affairs, which included a mobile phone account with Vodafone. And I clearly remember the company at the time (including the bereavement team) being so helpful in assisting me with the relevant matters, and resolving the financial situation in reasonable and compassionate manner, that the experience remains embedded in my memory. So: What on earth has happened since then!? It is so depressing to hear of these terribly negative experiences of Vodafone customers, and it just adds it seems to the general malaise seemingly caused by so many things nowadays. Vodafone now appears to have abandoned a previous good record of compassionate customer service to customers, particularly those dealing with such sad matters as bereavement, and caring for vulnerable loved ones.
Whereas, only a few years ago I would have gladly recommended it, particularly at least on the grounds of exercising compassion!",0

"Please do not buy from this company
I bought a TV from currys online back in April 2022. Four months later it went wrong. I phoned up and currys collected it and took it off to be repaired. They then apparently lost the TV so gave us a new one which was exactly the same make and model. We were fine with that. Four months later it went wrong again with the exact same problem as the last one. Sent it back via currys. We didn't hear anything for weeks, I kept phoning but wasn't getting anywhere, In the end it was getting near to Christmas and we wanted a TV to watch so I phoned again and asked for a refund so we could buy a different one as we didn't want another TV the same as it would probably go wrong again! Customer services said I could get a refund and said it would be in my account within 3 - 5 working days. It was not. Phoned again and was assured it would be in my account within 3 - 5 working days. It was not. Phoned again last week and was on the line for 55 mins, passed from one office to another, first of all they said I could not have a refund so I said that I would have my TV back repaired instead, finally after finding out the TV which was the same make and model we had paid for was out of stock they agreed to refund me and once again I was promised the money would be in my account within 3 - 5 working days. It was not. I have now given up fighting to get anything back from Currys, the refund or my TV, as the stress and frustration is making me ill. My sole aim now is to tell  others about the true nature of this company.  You have been warned!",0

Also got charged a connection fee but I rang up when they had an offer on where there was no connection fee, to be fair I did get that reimbursed, but still not happy I got charged for a full month when I wasn't connected for a couple of weeks. They tried to blame the connection in the area but there's plenty of our neighbors have internet and they said there was never a problem getting connected, so really don't know what the issue was or if it was just laziness by the engineer.",0
"I attempted to set up a D/D on my mothers Basic account but was told as account is closed I couldn‚Äôt. Sales said best package was broadband with 700 free minutes of calls per month. Engineers installed router on 19th and 2 days later (despite reassurances that analogue phone would still work) they cut the analogue phone off. The router has been fitted in her spare bedroom and she would be unable to hear the phone ring. I requested that the engineers call me on arrival, this never happened or the fitting of the adapters fitted to enable the analogue phone to work. Over the last 3 days I have spoken to 4 customer service staff, been cut off 3 times and been told 3 times that a manager would call to rectify the issue so that an elderly vulnerable person has access to a phone. No manager has called and BT‚Äôs idea of a fix is to revert to the analogue service - who will plug the hole in the wall they had to make for the cable? On checking there is a landline option only but one customer rep said only available to new customers whilst another said anyone. I have a fault reference VOL013-684744687455 from 2 days ago with no updates. BT respond to these reviews by requesting you contact them via social media, I am not on social media so they will need to contact me via other methods which so far they have failed to do.",0

Ok, so then we went to BT bussiness who did it in 3 weeks.
In October 2022 we received a router from shell ! We returned it and got a proof of postage. We also have a letter waiving our original order and clarifying there were no early termination fees as no service was ever provided.
December 2022, threatening letter from MIL collections for ¬£33, shell say it‚Äôs the router, MIL think it‚Äôs early termination. Spend ‚Äòyears‚Äôwaiting to get through to shell, and then on to MIL who are very aggressive and threatening.
Still can‚Äôt get any resolve even though I have proof .

I was told that they recommend using a PC to cancel. I used my phone. It seems that the process doesn't always work if you use mobile yet they do offer the cancellation option via mobile.

If you point out that you cancelled some time prior via mobile they may have to buckle because by their own admission the service is not reliable.

"I love Argos, I‚Äôve been buying from them for years and years and have never had any issues at all with them. They have a good range of things to buy, the only thing I wish they had more variety with is skincare and makeup but for home buys this is the place to get it from, fair prices and same day delivery. Also having the choice to buy now pay later interest free is amazing. I definitely recommend this company",1

i ordered a phone on the 6th February but very stupidly hadn‚Äôt read all of the reviews. A few hours after the purchase i realised i had made a mistake and requested a refund. Although the customer service is quite fast to respond, they constantly told me it would come in 5 working days or 10 working days, which was a lie. it is now the 1st of may, almost 3 months after requesting a refund (keeping in mind the phone hadn‚Äôt even been sent off so all they had to do was give me my money back) but i have finally received my refund. It is safe to say i am not purchasing anything from this website again and i do not recommend it to anyone.",0

"I have had Terrible speeds for longer now than I care to remember. I want this fixed I called twice today and spent over 90 MINUTES on hold. Our landline was suffering with interference on and off for months. Now it is BT that provide the line, so I called them and to be fair the open reach engineer they sent did a stellar job and the line is now as clear as a bell. He then told me to call Talk Talk and ask for a DML reset. So, I did and was put on hold, then they got slightly miffed as I did not call them for the engineer! But the issue was with the landline that could not be used! It sounded like someone was frying bacon! BT I could at least call on my mobile FREE! My internet speed is now averaging 1.0, i contacted them 5 or 6 weeks ago about this and my speeds are now worse! And whilst on hold I was cut off from them twice! This has also happened in the past and I am self-employed this has cost me in the past work and MONEY. I want my connections up to the speed as advertised, and I want compensation. I would not recommend them to my worst enemy, and they are charging me almost 30 quid a month for this! A baked bean can and string would be faster. Should change their name to Hold Hold! as you never get to speak to anyone and my internet keeps dropping out on calls on whatsapp and zoom for work. And the service is just shoddy and terrible. I am so going to change contract to someone with a better service, which lets face it anyone else will be better!",0

And now I can not get the item I want as it has gone up in price and out of stock...so they said they will give me a refund I will expect it in 3-5 days....but apparently they just say whatever they want as they have sent the same item out again!!! So when that arrives will have to go through the process again,0

Inaccurate description on site caused delay with getting correct item. Called to return and told I would receive a reply within 24 hours - no reply.

"Still no SIM cards arrived. This has been a complete waste of time, promised delivery on two separate occasions and nothing arrived on either day. Spoke with Vodafone and they cannot even say where the SIM cards are.

As such, we have cancelled the whole arrangement and will stay with our current provider. If Vodafone cannot get it right to issue and deliver just two SIM cards, what chance have you got????? Total failure and a total waste of time.

Was due to change from Tesco Mobile to Vodafone. Ordered two new sims from them and signed up for monthly contract. I received a text telling me my sims would arrive on Sunday 4th December. They never arrived. Then a text saying they would be delivered Tuesday 6th. Nothing yet. But I have had a text telling me my bill for this month is ¬£35.00 which will be taken out on 15th. SO they can't deliver my two SIM cards on time (twice) but they can take my money to suit themselves! Spoke with an agent online earlier today and he cannot tell me when the SIM cards will arrive, but he could also tell me when they will take money from my account Is this a giant rip off or what??? so do I get left hanging in limbo waiting for SIM cards that never arrive and then have to fight for my money back because the Simms do not arrive, or do I cancel now and stay with my current supplier??? think the current supplier may be the best route.

Thank you for your response vodafone, but we have now found a provider that works correctly. We have our new SIM cards from them and a fantastic service. Shame Vodafone provided such a poor service!",0

"Fridge decided to pack it in couple of weeks ago, shopped around and Argos were seemingly one of the quicker delivery dates with ¬£100 additional costs to install and remove old appliance just like the rest of the big companies, paid and selected a later slot between 5-9pm. Delivery date arrived, Van turned up at 3pm, delivery men advised Argos don't do installations of fridge-freezers, nor do they remove old appliances. Can't fault the delivery guys, very pleasant and as bewildered as I was. Customer Service advised of a fault on their website allowing them to add extras on and charge you additional, substantial sums of money for a service they don't even offer. Again, can't fault the CS Agent, no sugar coating it, advised it was a fault straight away and offered to remove delivery or full refund. Took full refund and went elsewhere. Shocking error to be making during a cost of living crisis at Christmas.",0
"In their greed, NOWTV have changed it so you can only watch on one device (Netflix & Amazon = 3, Disney = 4). Unless you pay an extra ¬£5 for ‚ÄòBoost‚Äô which is needed to enable the two of us to watch at the same time. And, on top of that, I can‚Äôt believe in 2021the greedy NOWTV has the cheek to charge extra for HD too!. We used to have a rolling contract to watch tv and sports, but their greed has driven us away and we only pay for what we need now. Your loss NOWTV!
Not happy with the greedy application of a monopoly and if there was another route available to watch F1, I‚Äôd use it instead.",0

Worst phone company I have dealt with. Terrible customer service! My phone would always cut out every time I made a phone call. Sometimes it wouldn‚Äôt even let me ring out. My data never worked. They offered me ¬£5 discount but still didn‚Äôt see what I was paying ¬£35 for a phone I couldn‚Äôt really use. They never listen to you or try to resolve your problems. They told me if I cancelled by a certain date I wouldn‚Äôt get charge for the whole month next month and I did. I cancelled on the app and received my pac code and received texts and call trying to get me back. Once I got billed again I chatted to them saying I have requested to cancel and they told me no I haven‚Äôt and you can‚Äôt do it on the app making out I was lying when you can definitely cancel on the app . Why would I get my pac code and texts and calls if I hadn‚Äôt cancelled ? The texts and calls I had from them confirmed I had ended my contract and would try to get Me to stay with them. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend at all.,0

"Major fault AGAIN it's happening every week in my area, we are paying loads per month for a service we are not getting only to be fobbed off when we call, I work from home so rely heavily on the broadband and have had to go else where to work which has cost me money due to the constant outage, I rang them on the 22nd and they said the problem will be fixed by 30th which means no I telnet or tv until then, my contract isn't due to end until next Dec and they won't let me out of my contract until which is absolutely ridiculous, if I loose my job through having no broadband what will they do then? We are being robbed paying per month for an intermittent shoddy service and when you call you just gwy told a script of how sorry they are without any indication as to what the problem is or when it will be fixed!! As soon as I can change I will be leaving virgin and will not recommend them to anybody, my family and friends have also left them in recent months.",0

"I recently decided to leave Vodafone after my phone was paid off as I found them too overpriced for what you got. They refused to unlock my phone, it's impossible to speak to someone who can actually do anything. They have a useless call centre who take your message and pass it on, the shops are all franchises that have nothing to do with Vodafone apparently, they just sell their stuff, I should be entitled to a refund or a replacement as my decide doesn't work for its intended purpose but they have refused. The staff are rude and ignorant of the law. I would avoid this company at all costs.",0

Called back 17 days after canceling it to find out what was happening, still no money, been told 3-5 working days. not a happy bunny, If this goes on past the next 5 day limiit, i'll be sending an invoice for interest on the with held funds.


Edited after you sent that response:
I have been to currys the shop, your man there said there is absolutely nothing they can do, while carphonewearhouse may be now owned by currys, its still on its own system. orders made on CHW cant be canceled or refunded by currys. I will go and hound your facebook page though,",0

Pathetic customer service ever. Why don't they close??? I don't understand what makes a company down to that level of poor management. I don't have words to explain their service. Its all messed up. Please guys stay away from them. Check reply its been 44 minutes on the phone,0
"Installation delays and lying agents. my services where due to go live on august the 12th but the engineer couldn't complete the installation. after two months and multiple phone calls Vodaphone finally installed my broadband on the 10 of October. during this time I was reassured by multiple agents on the phone that I would be compensated for the delay. I was told I would receive ¬£5.25 per day in compensation for the delays this was conformed on two separate phone calls. On the day my services went live spoke to the billing department and was told the full amount of ¬£315 in credit would be applied to my next bill.
imagine my surprise when my bill had no credit applied and after speaking to Vodaphone i was now told that they didn't own me anything in contradiction to the explicit reassurances of the previous thee phone calls. the fact that i was due compensation was the only reason I didn't leave within the 14 day window after the appalling two mouth installation delay. I am now stuck in a contract with no compensation and no way to leave without massive fees. I have little hope for the complaint process and will be getting legal advice. you can't promise someone compensation in the 14day cooling off period and then change your mind once they can no longer leave.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY.",0

"BT - useless robbing b******s!! I only gave one star - because it won't let me give no stars. I have been a customer for around 27 years - and have had broadband with them for around 18 years. I do live in a rural area - and so do not expect perfect service - but theirs has been truly shocking. When they came out with 'BT Infinity' a number of years ago, we tried to sign up for it to improve our lot - but unfortunately it was not available in our area. Eventually it did become available - and we signed up to receive the 100Mbps advertised - except that the small print said that we could only really expect 24-36Mbps - and the even smaller print said that they would only actually guarantee 17Mbps. Anyway, we saw no actual improvement - but some years later they launched 'Halo' - which was going to infinitely improve things. No it didn't. After probably 5-6 years of 'Infinity' - having films constantly freeze or drop out while we're trying to watch them - or teenagers screaming down the stairs because their game has just frozen 'again' - we decided it was time to try an alternative. So we arranged to change over to Truespeed - 350Mbps guaranteed direct fibre - for ¬£16/month less than the robbers at BT charge for their 17Mbps. I duly phoned to inform BT that we would be leaving, and was told that after my 27 years of loyal service, they were going to reward me with a ¬£128 charge for cancelling their contract early. I was not too happy with this, so decided that I would also cancel the landline, the BT TV, and the four mobile phones that we have with them as well. I have just received my regular bill with all of the regular charges - so phoned to ask why, when we stopped using all of their services over the last 1-2 weeks? They apologised, and said they would wipe the bill - however, there would still be a cancellation charge. I said that was fine - I'd already been told it would be ¬£128. No, they said, it will be ¬£398!!! For cancelling a service that was complete b******s for the whole 18 years that we had it?!? I just spent an hour on the phone - utterly pointlessly arguing my case. These w*****s have you over a barrell - because if you don't pay (and they intend to 'take' their money within 7 days) - they will simply f*** up your credit rating - and still hound you until you pay - so I just have to bite the bullet while they dip their greedy hands in to my bank account one last time. I would strongly advise that no-one ever uses BT for anything - ever. We now have Truespeed for broadband and landline, Sky for TV, and EE for mobile (yes I know they're owned by BT - but their deal was ¬£13/month less than BT - with more data) - and we can't believe the difference in the quality of all of those services - it's been like stepping out of the dark ages - and all for around ¬£28/month less than those robbing f*****s were charging us for all those years - w**k s****s - the lot of them! ¬£5 prize to the first person who figures out what all the blanked out words are (unless you work for BT - you lot have had quite enough of my money thank you!)",0
"Two orders over ¬£80 were both not delivered but marked delivered. After finally getting through to someone on live chat, I was told that the orders would not be refunded. Theft, pure and simple. After using their service for many years, they've now lost a customer in me forever.",0

"I had brilliant internet for two years from talk talk that was easy to set up. However, they then upgraded me to future fibre automatically and then turned my internet off when I elected not to have this. Despite my internet not working , I was still charged. I tried to cancel my account- this was difficult and stressful and they still wanted to continue charging me for another month but agreed to a compromise. I thought it was resolved. It wasn't, had to call in again (very difficult to actually speak to anyone) and was told I hadn't cancelled it. The whole experience has been awful- has made me feel really stressed and cost me money for a service they have not provided. I had been happy with talk talk internet for two years before, and if they had owned their error and resolved it I would have stayed. As it is, I now would not return to talk talk even if they were the cheapest on offer, because of how awful it has been trying to resolve the situation. It's a shame they let themselves down on this front.",0

"What an absolute joke this company is. After them cancelling both my Vodafone accounts in December and being told I had not paid a bill in August, which I had in fact paid, i recently sent them bank statements from August 21 to date. They agree that I did in fact pay the bill but it was reversed!!!!! After checking with my bank and knowing this had not been refunded to my bank account that‚Äôs why I sent the bank statements to date to prove this. Im now being offered ¬£400 and still owe over ¬£2000 for early termination fee!!! I didn‚Äôt end the contract they did because they said I had not paid bill in August!!!!! This, I‚Äôve been told, is now going to a higher level within Vodafone!!!! Absolute sham of a company who can‚Äôt wait to bump you for money you don‚Äôt owe and should never been charged as it was their error. My next step will be the Ombudsman or court as at least then it will get sorted out once and for all. Very disappointed in Vodafone who I have been with for many years.",0

I have purchased a platinum straightener on 2nd august 2022, and just stop working Actually is the 3rd straightener bought from GHD, which let me down
Very frustrating!
The customer service is useless just the same old automated reply The phone line is out of service. I wonder do they have customer Service?
I have asked for a refund as the product is still in warranty but no reply. Yes, It almost looks like a Scam Company.",0
"Below is a narrative of breath-taking logistical incompetence.

On 30 Sept I ordered an item from Currys for delivery on 9 Oct.

On 5 Oct I ordered another item from Currys that was back in stock, with delivery in 10-21 days. 2 days later I received notice that this second item would actually be delivered earlier than expected, on 10 October.

Because we don't yet live in the house, which is 30 miles away from where we currently live, and is in a lockdown zone, I got in touch via Twitter to ask for these to be combined into one delivery on the 10th.

I was told this was not possible, and was offered 11 Oct instead. I immediately declined this because can't be there on the 11th, and said we'd make the original dates work.

The customer service agent pressed the button to confirm the slot for the 11th anyway. I made that clear that this was a problem, and they promised to correct it. The next day (8 Oct) I received text messages confirming the deliveries were back to their original dates (9&10 Oct).

But wait! There's more! This evening (8 Oct) I logged in to see if there was a delivery time for tomorrow's delivery (9 Oct) so I can plan my day and travel accordingly, only to see it's schedule for 11 October...I know, right?

I've tried contacting the company, but have not gotten through, and now don't know if I need to travel to the house or not, so needless to say, this company's name really should be changed to 'Team Knowhow To Mess Everything Up'",0
"Biggest crooks I have ever used, I cancelled my subscription with now tv in Dec 2020 and they‚Äôre still taking payment from me!! You can not speak with anyone directory from the tv department and either have a live chat or email conversation. For the three months over payment they took from my account they admitted they can see I haven‚Äôt logged in nor watch any thing since Dec 2020. They offered me 1 months worth of credit... even though I cancelled with them.

I would never use them again worse company ever!!",0
"Non existent customer service. Faulty cooker delivered and due to some very tight time constraints, (long story)I went and brought a replacement so that my electrician could wire it in and get us going straight away. I thought, no problem I'll sort the return & refund tomorrow. Several places on their website & their T&C's said I could return to a store. As I had literally nowhere to store this item while awaiting a lengthy collection process, I put in in the car and took it to my local store. The manager was really unhelpful said I couldn't return to store. So I left it with them anyway as I couldn't take it back. Then the lengthy saga of trying to contact customer service to explain where it was and for it to be uplifted. Their email address is no longer in service. The phone service after a lengthy wait said they couldn't help, neither could the online chat service. No one there will give you an email address to put your complaint in writing. They were happy to take my money and all is probably OK if you don't run into any problems.
So the faulty cooker is now in your Stratford upon Avon store awaiting Currys to process my refund, which I've been told I won't get. So all I have left is a letter before action followed by a Small Claims through the court system. I have used Currys many, many times before and never have has such poor service.",0

upgraded my phone with Carphone Warehouse on 28th April 2020 - phone arrived 29th April. On 4th May phone was faulty so contacted CPW using the web chat. arrangements made to collect faulty phone next day with promise replacement phone would be delivered as soon as it was received at the warehouse. Confirmation from DPD that phone arrived at warehouse 7th May. No replacement phone or information on a phone so went through web chat again on 13th May. Told no black versions available and would I be happy with Silver - yes!!! Next day phone arrives but DPD driver cannot leave my phone as he has to collect one from me - he remembers collecting my phone the week before!! Phone returns to CPW. way too many frustrating web chats later and still no phone - finally think i am getting somewhere on 21st May until web chat customer service states that they cannot send me my phone until they have received my faulty one ( I have previously been told on all web chats that they can see my phone has been returned) that was it for me I asked for the upgrade to be cancelled as I was desperate for a working phone - working long shifts away from my family without a working phone not acceptable in the pandemic!! I was then told that I was out of the cooling off period as I had only contacted CPW on 13th May - I disputed this and the customer service representative asked the cancellation team to check this and they then agreed I had contacted them on 4th May and would cancel the upgrade. This would take up to 7 days. 7 days later no contact reference my cancellation so I called customer services now it was working again. I was told there was no notification of my upgrade to be cancelled and I would need to contact EE to do this. I asked to speak to a manager and was told he could not contact one as he was working at home but he could get one to give me a call that day??? I said I would like a manager to contact me. Guess what? no manager contacted me. The next day I contacted EE and talked to a really lovely helpful customer service lady who listened to my story and then explained that it would cost me a fortune to cancel my upgrade - At this point I broke down in tears as I am so fed up and low through this experience. She said she would contact someone at carphone warehouse - 5 minutes later a customer service man was apologising to me for the way I had been treated and said he could see the problem the phone had been sent out incorrectly and the phone was at the warehouse he then said he could sort this and get the phone delivered to me today he even said he guaranteed it would be here today!!! Guess what no phone has arrived no email regarding my phone no contact whatsoever - absolute disgrace to leave a care worker without the means to contact family whilst working long shifts looking after others - this whole experience has upset me deeply and caused me needed stress and worry. I have no idea what to do anymore just fed up spending time and effort trying to sort this issue out - time that is precious to me given current circumstances - CPW are a disgrace.,0

Every staff member says they understand, apologise but they can only pass it to a manager. Always that manager ‚Äúwill contact you within 24 hours‚Äù. Always they don‚Äôt.

"They dont deserve one star. It took 3 weeks to connect me. They still took payment FROM MY BANK for no service.

THEY LIE, THEY ARE DECEITFUL, THEY ARE INCOMPETENT AND THINK THAT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS WHEN A CUSTOMER SERVES THEM
So as instructed I sent a message via facebook. They said a manager would contact me and discuss my concerns. NO call. I asked when and they said they dont know. I think I may know, never.

Told BT that I was moving home back on the 13th October. Still no broadband or home phone number almost 2 months later!!! I've been been given dates on two occassons for an engineer to call around and took time off work to be home. Nobody bothered turning up. Nothing but plattitudes and broken promises from their customer contact team. Seems like Openreach is killing their business and I'm writing to Clive Selley their CEO to tell him what I think.

"Do NOT use this company.

I had in the past been fairly happy with Quick Mobile Fix when they provided a decent service and you were able to actually phone them up. I was actually quite a good customer of theirs.

In late 2019 they were investigated by Redbridge Trading Standards following numerous complaints of taking orders, not delivering on these orders and then simply generating delay tactic after delay tactic in providing refunds. Although their owner Chinedu Emechebe stated everyone received their refunds (which may or may not be true) they are categorically not complying with distance selling laws as I write this. They are NOT offering 14 day refunds on orders they do not fulfil. However, what they will do is take your money and put it in their bank in the full knowledge that they simply don't have a product to sell. Then when you try to phone them to speak to someone you find they have withdrawn that service too. Essentially you just end up pulling your hair out, are considerably financially out of pocket and for this price receive generically worded emails that mean absolutely nothing, say nothing and achieve nothing.

They state that any delays will be communicated to customers and they will be sure to 'pop an email over to you' to let you know. Not true. They state they work to distance selling laws of 14 day refunds. Not true. They offer to enter into a sales contract with you that they cannot fulfil. True.

My wife never received her iPhone order she made in early March to a value over ¬£370. After 3 weeks she simply gave up and cancelled it. Did she receive an order number for the purchase? NO. Did she receive a receipt or invoice for the purchase? NO. Did Quick Mobile Fix give her a 14 day refund? NO. Why not? because of their [quote} ""current banking and staffing situation"". When is our refund currently 'due'? 25th May. Have we asked for a receipt? Yes. Have they supplied one? No. Have we asked for an order number? Yes. Have they supplied one? No. Are they still trading online? Yes.

We've now presented them with a letter of deadlock for a 14 day response. We've not heard back and will now write to the Ombudsman.

We eventually purchased a phone from Giff Gaff and got it the next day.

Avoid this experience at all costs.",0
"I feel I've been scammed by this company I paid for an order that never arrived when I called them they said the has arrived they have a system that tracks the driver to prove that the order was delivered to my property . I live on the basement and on the basement there's another 36-41.flats he never came down to the basement I have stairs going down to the basement. he went to the above block 42-52 which they have their own internal security door the entrance is on the main street. Entrance of the basement is through the estate with stairs going down to the basement. Same block different entrances to the buildings
Yet they still said order was delivered which I can prove it wasn't delivered because I have a ring doorbell camera which shows no delivery at all on the time in the dates but they refuse to believe these and refuse another delivery and refused to give my money back. Absolutely disgusting they are thieves they take your money from your account and don't deliver your order. Absolutely disgusting I would give him 0",0
"I ordered a phone last week in May and cancelled on 6th June as there was no sign of a phone being despatched. I emailed today on 1st July as I still had not received my refund and have been told it will be on or before 6th August. Even given their very lame excuse of limited staff this is totally unacceptable. I took the phone on finance with Divide Buy who are still taking the monthly payments from me and cannot cancel finance because Quick Mobile Fix has to cancel it with them. Again totally unacceptable in this day and age of instant communication that this has not been done. I will update this post when I eventually receive my refund

Surprise surprise still no refund. This company is a joke DO NOT DEAL WITH THEM AT ANY COST",0
"Shell Energy first contacted me via a text that I could not respond to saying I owed them around 30 pounds. No details were given as to property affected, dates involved or units charged, just an account number. I therefore challenged this and called them waiting for a long time to answer. I was asked on the phone by an employee for addresses of property I owned as apparently he could not find a record of the property. I refused to discuss this with him as it had all the hallmarks of a phishing plot. As it worked out it was a property I owned and apparently the costs were those between tenancies. My property agent and not Shell provided these details. However in September when I first queried the billing by calling Shell they stated that I owed 419.09 pounds. The agent agreed that this was an unusually high sum and opened an investigation. Since then I have received further communication and demands that I pay the said 400 pounds plus. I also received a text that said that the complaint had been closed but that if I was not happy to email them . I did this and requested details of their investigation and why they closed my complaint. Despite intimating in their closure that they would reopen and respond, they failed to do so but continue to send both unsupported, no reply texts as well as written demands that I immediately settle a bill for an account that they are aware was opened by the tenant and not myself. I again spoke to a representative of Shell Energy who again said it would be put on hold while investigations are ongoing (approximately 30 days). No such luck, the demands continue. Indeed Shell Energy are also pursuing the current tenant and my property agent has also been in contact with Shell and they are being quoted yet a different amount. To compound matters, Shell Energy use AI ti respond. These bots are even more useless than smart meters and only push Shell Energy agendas but waste consumer time. It is high time these energy companies ( I have a similar problem with another supplier at my normal residence are held accountable by regulators and not permitted to harass any customer during a period of dispute. Like all reasonable people, I have no problem paying for something that I justifiably owe but will not settle any unsupported bill. Despite all my efforts and those of my agent, the matter remains unresolved by Shell Energy. Stiff fines and customer satisfaction measures need to be introduced. In this way energy companies instead of wasting money trying (so far unsuccessfully) to automate responses would instead focus on informing customers in a clear manner immediately a concern is raised as to why they are being charged in the form of an itemised bill. Should Shell Energy chose to respond, I hope it is in a direct manner rather than my experience so far . (No useless Bots please). Account Number is 6024135 whichI repeat was not opened by me.",0

"Rang Carfone Warehouse on 14/08/2021 in regards to a phone case which I was told I would recieve for free as a gesture but it wasn't in stock, found one on there website hence phone call on the above date, the sales person on the phone was blunt and rude and told me they don't give free products in relation to the sale.
There are nice ways to talk/ tell people what can and can't be done but not this person, wish he was making the sale so that I would have had the satisfaction of putting the phone down on him and not making the purchase/ upgrade.
My advise would be don't upgrade over the phone, go into store if you can, if you do purchase over the phone, take your time, make note of time and date and most importantly the name of the person your talking too, if you get cut off don't worry wait for them to call you back, to call them it costs a fortune.

"As executor of my late brother's estate, I found paperwork indicating he had an insurance policy for his mobile phone with these people. Like many other companies I had to advise, I called them to let them know of his passing. The call handler refused to engage with me, quoting 'Data Protection' despite me having all the details of his policy. It was suggested I take my ID and a copy of his death cert to a Carphone Warehouse shop somewhere and make an enquiry there. I responded that I simply needed to know if there was a policy in force to know if it was worth the trip, but they refused to even confirm that. There was no indication if any pro-rata refund of premium was due so I just advised that if the policy had been renewed, I'd let it lapse.

For it's total inability to deal sympathetically with a bereavement case, this is the worst company I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with!

* In response to Team Knowhow's reply - I had the death certificate available, and my late brother's Will appointing me as Executor and offered to submit copies of these, but the operator flatly refused to even indicate whether I should submit these presumably because doing so would have given away that there was a matter that needed to be dealt with. Exectly how the suggestion of going to a Carphone Warehouse high street shop (a further inconvenience at an already stressful time) would have helped, is beyond me.

I dealt with numerous organizations in dealing with my late brother's affairs, from the government to both finance and legal companies and Team Knowhow was unique in being the only company that refused to assist in any way, despite relevant supporting legal documentation being offered.",0

Moving house experience has been a complete disaster with BT. Still no phone or WiFi 2 weeks since moving. First call of approx one hour running through new address all seemed fine until we moved and nothing working or received as promised. Rang again for another 40 min + call to discover that the BT geniuses had set the transfer of our landline and wifi to the house next door to where we used to live. So went through everything again and they promised to send out a mini hub to see us through to when we got reconnected. A few days later still nothing so rang again (another 45 min + call) and turns out they hadn't input the new address correctly....AGAIN. The lady I ended up speaking to 3rd time around was great and we did then receive the mini hub. However the download speeds on the mini hub are completely unacceptable (2.8 Mbps!) and have made it completely impossible to work from home effectively. The whole experience is just completely unacceptable and a complete shambles. Supposedly being reconnected in a few more days but I'll believe it when it happens! I hope BT manage to get the call recordings for training purposes and actually use it to prevent others going through a similar amateurish mess of an experience.,0
Terrible customer service. Increased the price of a 12 month plan 2 months into the contract. When requested an explanation they say that it is in the small print. Beware when dealing with Three,0

"We had purchased an iPad through Very.co.uk and we also purchased an insurance policy at the same time. We need to have the iPad repaired under the Accidential Damage clause on the insurance policy and I have been arranging the return of the iPad to Very.co.uk all this week for collection via DPD today for the repair to take place. I was told earlier in the week by the Very Protect - Repair Department that I would receive notification yesterday (Thursday) evening/this morning of a one hour time slot when the iPad would be collected. At 9.30am this morning, I had not received any notification, so I called Very Protect - Repair Department to ask if they had an update. Well . . . what can I say I have never been so rudely spoken to by anyone like this on the telephone. I was speaking on behalf of my partner (and there is a permission on the account so I can do this). I was spoken to like a piece of s**t on her shoe. Raised her voice and then hung up on me. DISGUSTING CUSTOMER SERVICE! This lady who is representing Very.co.uk should not be working in Customer Services and I now have a very poor opinion of Very.co.uk and I will never purchase from them again.",0
My mother has a BT basic account as she is on benefits and is a low user. I'm trying to upgrade to basic with broadband but it isn't possible to add this online. This means a phone call to BT. At the moment I've spoken to 5 different people at BT who take all my and my mother's security details then put me on hold for 10 minutes before I go through the process again. I've been on the phone now for 37 minutes and I still haven't got any further than when I started.,0
"A terrible company. I need the internet set up at my new place; which was over a month ago and they still haven‚Äôt done it.

"Unfortunately the truth is their network is a joke, keeps freezing for a few seconds every 15-30 minutes while the router is literally 2m from me.

Thankfully I don`t pay a penny for it but if I`d I`ll hire an attorney as this is a joke dude.",0
I am trying to cancel my contract because I am moving and not longer need the service. It's taken over an hour and it's still not complete.

Also, when traveling, the data passport purchasing is a joke, and would also consistently be broken. I'd have to pay for a 24 hour passport but never got a full 24 hours b/c I would inevitably lose several hours trying to (manually) purchase a new passport every 24 hours.

"Shockingly awful service.

How can they exist as a legal business?

At first I was so happy to see deliveroo in my area as I live in a remote area currently which is a very small town with limited resources that a city has

Coming from.a big city like London and nottingham where I'm used to numerous food apps like chop chop, whoosh, amazon fresh etc loads of other same day food services ...living in a remote area is abit tricky with food services if you don't pre order online for the regular shopping.

When I saw morrisons was on the deliveroo app I was really pleased and tried the service over 3 months...spending quite alot of money ..hundreds of pounds

I became more and more concerned that when things were missing in.my order or substituted for wrong items...(which I couldn't eat as I've food allergies and I didn't select for substitutes to even be allowed ...) id call.customer service and be told they couldn't help me and refused to refund me for items I was charged for but didn't receive

That is theft

Luckily I paid PayPal so I'm going to try and open a case with PayPal to try and get my money back

I would advise anyone using this app to pay PayPal so they are covered if their order isn't correct

Was just shocked that they take people's money but don't refund them when they have an issue

Sadly I'm no longer using this app as can't afford to lose money on stuff I've not received or I'd wrong

Really poor poor service and so shocked in this day and age they cab legally get away with this",0

It's disgusting and makes me wonder if there is something more sinister going on taking people's details crediting checking them and then cancelling order. Really weird. I will never use them again.

I have an ongoing contract with Carphone Warehouse. Unfortunately I broke my phone and I have now written three times to them asking how I can purchase a replacement. To date I have not even had the courtesy of an acknowledgement to any of my three letters.

Adjusted offer to ¬£43.50?
Having rejected the offer I have now received a revised offer of ¬£140.
Having now read their reviews it looks like this is common practice to reduce values in the hope that you are desperate to sell and can‚Äôt be bothered to wait for the return of your phone.
Will see if they revise the offer and if not how long they take to return them.
Would definitely not recommend and will be reporting to trading standards for misleading selling tactics. Order ref M8380577.

I made a purchase from Car Phone Warehouse online on the 19th of January 2019. Phoned up immediately to confirm that the phone was available to collect in store next day as specified on the website and was told the stock level was wrong and it would not be available for collection. Was also told that the purchase did not go through due to a problem with my card. Not CPW‚Äôs fault but would have been nice to receive an error message or notification of some kind! After phoning the bank spoke to CPW again and placed the order again on the phone. Was informed that the previous order was definitely cancelled. The following day received a notification that the phone from the first order was ready to collect in store! Phoned up to get this cancelled and was told I would have to speak to the specific store. Phoned up the store and was told they were unable to cancel at the present time. In both of these calls it was suggested to me that I should visit the store in person to rectify their own mistake. The cheek of it! Lost several hours with this joke of a company and now either have to go to the store or wait 2 weeks to get my money back. The end.,0

"So this is an update to my 'plumber' review following Bark contacting me.
So they have refunded ¬£147.00 to my account which was taken without permission. The amount that was actually taken without permission was ¬£162.00 but why quibble. I am not sure but I think my account has now been refunded the credits under the get hired guarantee.
So, what do I think now? My experience of the 'leads' is that none of them are qualified and none of them are interested in doing business. The automated screening is something you can fill in in a few seconds and there is no verification. What you get is a load of single name contacts with a 'requirement' who you send credits to contact, who ignore that contact and then close their requirement. It is hard to see what the difference would be if I just paid a few mates to stick some nonsense up on a website and then run away and ignore if anyone responds. It's like an electronic knock and run. The message that someone 'wants you to contact them' is generated just by someone looking at your profile. I didn't realise this and then spent time explaining to a very unhappy woman why I was 'calling her out of the blue'. The others who state that they want help establishing their business, have in fact had no ideas, no plan and no money. They are after free consultancy, which I understand but I need to eat too. All in all an utter waste of time and money. I would recommend anyone explores other options to grow their business as Bark is no good at all for professional services. I regret getting involved and wasting my hard earned cash.",0
I bought a pass to watch a match. Got a receipt and money went from bank - but it would not activate so we couldn‚Äôt watch the match. Website says we have no passes. Live chat is useless and so far (3days) there is no response to my email. Avoid this company if you can.,0
"Really poor customer service. Mentioned before I ordered that I would like to know where the cables would be routed INSIDE my house. Was advised a pre-site visit could be done once ordered

I ordered and arranged this visit, specifically saying it's the routing inside the house. I took half a day's annual leave to do so (I don't get paid holidays). No one turned up meaning I lost half a day's wage for nothing

Went on live chat about it and was advised that pre-site visits are external only. I mentioned that I've specifically asked for internal and this wasn't questioned. Got told again it's external only and was offered ¬£5 bill credit for my lost wage which is ¬£150

I rang up to cancel and was put through to the pre-install team to cancel. I was then put on mute for 30 minutes which led up to closing time.

I rang the pre-install team this morning to cancel, they put me through to retentions who said that this is due to new staff not being trained properly and misinforming me. They then transferred me back to the pre-install team who offered me a Wi-Fi dongle or 1 month's bill credit

2 hours of calls later it's finally cancelled.",0

"Absolutely awful.
I have been paying for KnowHow cover for several years now and every time my laptop returns it's barely fixed and has to be sent off again for the same issue within a few months.

Unsurprisingly the fault it keeps going in for reappeared so once again I handed my laptop over to KnowHow, expecting them to once again bodge a repair and return my laptop within a week or so.

I didn't have a charger for my laptop as it gave up the ghost some time ago so I use a universal charger for my laptop as well as several other devices. I supplied my charger when I handed over the laptop.
When my laptop was returned they'd binned my charger and replaced it for the model specific one which has actually made me pretty mad because the universal charger was also my only way of charging several other devices so now I'll have to buy another one!

But that really isn't the problem with my recent experience. The problem is that even though my laptop was only sent away to repair one teeny weeny part, they decided to completely reformat my computer! They have never done that before and had no need to seeing as it was only sent in for the smallest repair, they shouldn't have been messing around with my OS at all!

So long story short, I've just lost all of my baby pictures of my children, all my music, documents including my CV and finance spreadsheets. All my games (I bought it as a gaming laptop so I had loads of games and mods installed on there!).
They completely wiped my entire laptop of everything.
When I contacted KnowHow I was told that because I signed the contract they aren't liable.
The contract says that if they have to access the OS they aren't liable for data lost nor are they liable should a Service All be performed.
Funny loophole considering I hadn't asked nor stated that I wanted them to do that!
If they'd have phoned me and said ""here's the situation"" and asked what I wanted to do next I would have asked for my laptop to be returned so I could back it up myself and then I'd send it back off to them, but at no point was I made aware that they could randomly decide to completely reformat my PC on a whim.

Even the man on the phone asked if the store had questioned a backup when I handed my device over but no, the store did not mention a backup, probably because like me they assumed it wouldn't be needed!

Of course KnowHow have said that if I want my data back I'll have to pay nearly ¬£100 to have my data returned and there's a chance I won't even receive all of it.

For context to this entire thing, the small repair I needed was for my charger dock to be reconnected! That's all I needed.

Safe to say that I'll be cancelling my cover and will be sticking to independent businesses for computer troubles in the future, and I'll be advising every other idiot who falls for this trap to steer clear of them too!",0
"My internet went ""active"" on the 16th of June. It wasn't working, so an engineer was scheduled and the engineer arrived on the 20th of June to resolve the issue.

The calls I'm being charged for, some of them are to NOW's customer service, so they'll have it recorded.
I tell them to call the engineer, or reach out to OpenReach, or listen to these call logs; and they refuse to do any of that and that the charges will stand.

"I upgraded to an I-phone 14 in November 2022 and included AppleCare insurance for ¬£14 per month extra, which is being paid.
Unfortunately, a broken screen requires a claim.
A visit to Apple, which took a very frustrating and expensive half day out of my Christmas, shows that
Vodafone have not recorded my insurance cover with Apple, as they require, to cover the ¬£600 plus cost of repair
Attempts (over 30, at various times over 3 days) to reach the insurance services phone line link via Vodafone to correct this have been futile; variously: no answer, ""unobtainable"" tone and loop back process.
A visit to a Vodafone shop (twice) has confirmed that I am covered, but they have no more luck with access to the, apparently ""3rd party"", insurance line supplier than I.
A very long wait on the complaints line resulted in a helpful man confirming that I was covered and he put me through to the Insurance ""Advisor"".
This person started a conversation about the cover we had but then CUT OUT. There is no way I can get back to this advisor.
A mixture of Vodafone incompetence and disinterested insurance supplier adds up to appalling service.
I now still have a broken phone with 22 months still to pay.
Avoid Vodafone like the plague.

"No sense pay for insurance, they are not helpful. Waste of time spending on the phone trying contact with repair centre . They sending message about contact with them and not answer .!!! Returned unrepaired iPad !!! Not message about this . Message was great news your iPad is ready for collect !!! Bloody joke !!!!",0
"Had 4 contracts with these. Leaving with all after many happy years due to corporate greed.
Moved on to higher tariff with no notice on one account (increased by ¬£10) that's ¬£2 more than the cheapest available on the website for the exact same usage.
The other I was notified they would move me to a more expensive deal for less data.
So multiple contracts with them now means zero.
Had enough so the other two are coming away from these tools once the contract is up in 2 months.",0
The item did not arrive in time for a Christmas gift even though it said delivered! A chat bot confirmed that it was out of stock and had not been dispatched- there had been a computer glitch. I‚Äôm still awaiting a refund. First time used argos on line - not impressed,0
"It never worked for me. I made a 2 year contract and after a week when I realised I have problems with the consistency of the Internet they said they are too many people with Bt broadband in the are. How was I supposed to know this. I called them at least 10 times. The costumer service is OK,they don't hold you too much on the line and they try to solve the problem but didn't do anything for me even after sending an engineer. I had to put extra data on my phone because I was using data at home just to watch YouTube. I'm about to call them again tomorrow.",0
"We have been told to wait 4 DAYS for someone to come out and fix our boiler. No hot water, no heating. It‚Äôs 5C outside right now and absolutely freezing. The boiler has failed many times, each time, we get told it has been sorted for good. Shocking company. No care at all. Do not bother with them.",0
"I Received a faulty phone , no mic when recording video. send the phone back now after 6 month i am yet to get money back or replacement.
!!!!DO NOT BUY!!!! anything from them. horrible service. no phone contact , and emails just reply with generic automated respond. NEVER AGAIN",0
"I hope this serves as a warning for anyone thinking if using Shell Broadband services.

I had signed up in August for a broadband connection and it 2nd week of November they haven‚Äôt managed to install or get the service running.

DONT BE FOOLED BY THIER PRICES or PROMOTIONS - they are one of the worst service providers I have seen in my entire 30+ years life

I thought the same when signing up that it wont happen to me but regret is like the least of my feelings",0
"I ordered baby thank you cards, they came and the name on the back of the cards was different to my son‚Äôs. While this was a mistake of mine not seeing there was another side to edit (it wasn‚Äôt clear on the website), I think it would have been good customer service to write to me to ensure this was what I wanted as surely good sense would tell you it probably isn‚Äôt if the names on either side don‚Äôt match. A waste of money as I can‚Äôt use the cards I ordered.",0
"05/05/2021
I attended Curry store in Lancaster to report a number of faults with the TV. Your helpful assistant advised me that I would be contacted by telephone so as to try to resolve the problems over the phone.
10/05/2021
I was contacted by a representative of Samsung who advised me that as the TV was out of their warranty, there would be a collection cost of ¬£250.00p so that they could investigate the cost of the repairs.
11/05/2021
I returned to the Lancaster store to explain what Samsung had said. I was advised that this was an error and that, as the TV was covered by Team Knowhow warranty, it would be collected for repair.
12/05/2021
I did not hear regarding a collection date so telephoned your team and arranged for a collection date of 13/05/2021. During this call I DID explain that the TV was mounted on the wall. (By Curry at point of sale)
13/05/2021
Pete and his assistant arrived but could not take it down, explaining that this needed to be done by a specialist install team. Pete telephoned his office to explain and said that arrangements would be made and that someone would contact me with a revised collection date.
17/05/2021
After a delay of 3 days and, as no one had contacted me I again rang in order to get an update. I was informed that your ‚Äúsystem was down‚Äù and told to ring again later. On the next attempt I was given a collection date of 20/05/2021
20/05/2021
John arrived to collect the TV. However, he was alone and explained that he was not insured to remove the TV and that a specialist team was needed. He telephoned his office, explained the situation and arranged for the team to pick it up on 23/05/2021
22/05/2021
I received notification that the team would not arrive until 24/05/2021
24/05/2021
The two-man team arrived, satisfactorily demounted the TV from the wall and left, with the TV, smart box, and all leads. Attached to the smart box were images of the error messages that I had been receiving.
27/05/2021
I received 2 phone calls from your Newark repair centre and, on the first call discussed the faults and, on the second was assured by the engineer that the faults had been rectified. He explained that there was a remedy to solve the error message ‚ÄúToo Many Reservations‚Äù and that he would write down the procedure how to fix this and attach it to the smart box.
31/05/2021
The TV was returned but not put on the wall as the delivery person said that he was alone and not qualified to hang it. A specialist team would be needed. I asked him for the smart box which he said that he did not have.
01/06/2021
I did not hear from Team Knowhow so, I phoned again and spoke with both Ali and Denise. Denise said that the first available date for the installation team was 17/06/2021. I said that I was not happy at having to wait so long. Denise also said that she would contact the branch and arrange for the smart box to be returned.
17/06/2021
Although 2 team members (Liam and one other) did attend our premises, they decided not to hang the TV because it would need to be removed again when the box was delivered and the box was still with Team knowhow.
18/06/2021
No contact from Team knowhow

Had bt to upgrade my WiFi so could use it upstairs A bt engineer firstly put the incoming wire in an unsightly place so I moved it myself they drilled a hole and broke the outside brickwork which is right next to my front door then my bt tv did not work Bt got another engineer to come out and sort out my tv tho did take over a week I then complained to bt who said they would get another department to call me they never did I then called them again and again they said they would get another dept to call me they never did though but did contact me to ask if the dept had called me and again said they would follow this up That was about a week ago and still not heard from them I‚Äôm thinking of stopping my direct debit to get this sorted Think again if using bt,0
"Please do not use this Company. They sent me a faulty device and are now refusing to refund my money despite me returning the goods within the required timeframe. Customer service is appalling and despite lodging several complaints it has had no effect in obtaining my rightful refund.

"This has been a completely appalling experience from start to finish. Upon receiving my Beko washing machine it developed a fault after the first wash. After various back and forth over the phone and web chat, an appointment was made for an engineer to come out and fix it. After the third attempt, taking over 2 weeks, it was written off. I contacted Currys to inform them of this and they said they will organise a replacement. After a few days I contacted them as I hadn't heard anything and was told they'll get back to me. As I hadn't heard anything for a few more days I contacted them to find out what was happening. I was then informed that the machine was out of stock and I'll need to order a replacement. I asked if this was possible over the phone but was told no and as the initial order was on a gift card, I‚Äôd need to wait up to 14 days before it came through the post to use. An additional 5 -7 days would be added due to to the old item needing to be returned. I challenged this as I hadn‚Äôt had a working washing machine for around 3 weeks so could they please send me an e-gift card. I was told that wasn‚Äôt possible. After 14 days had expired I questioned where the card was and could I make a complaint. I was told that no direct number exists to the complaints department but a manager would call me back. Of course, I received no call. All through this process I was told I‚Äôd be kept up to date via email. I didn‚Äôt receive one single email.

Finally, the gift card showed up‚Ä¶in the form of an e-gift card. Something I was told wasn‚Äôt possible to do. By this time the machine I wanted was out of stock. Eventually I managed to get a ex-demo from my local branch but the whole saga, over Christmas, meant I didn‚Äôt have a working washing machine for 5 weeks.

All in all this was completely unacceptable. No apology, no compensation, and no communication. I had to spend well over a month phoning and being passed around departments while everyone passed the blame and no one could help. Never written a review before, and wasn‚Äôt going to, but after seeing the ‚ÄòHow did we do?‚Äô Mailer in my inbox I had to get it off my chest!",0
"Terrible customer service. Forced to pay for another 30 days even though my contract. has ended. Took me a week to speak to somebody. The whole 18 months I was with them, my internet speed was shocking. Really pissed off!!!",0
"Awful awful and yet again, awful. I had an upload speed of 457.9kbps...my Nokia 3330 had a faster upload speed. Inconsistent speeds and forget gaming with some mates, as your connection will always be poor. I will definitely cancel my contract and go with someone else, I'd rather pay more money for a stable and useable connection than this.",0
"We got put with Shell when our energy company went under and have had nothing but bad service since. We use ¬£100-¬£130 per month (summer) and are ¬£600 in credit, recently received an email to say they are upping our payments to ¬£400 per month else we will be in debt by Feb!! I objected and they allowed me to drop the payments to ¬£270 which plus the governments help is over ¬£330 per month. Just received this months bill and they have charged us ¬£419 for the ¬£193 we have used and the website is down so I can‚Äôt look into it‚Ä¶they seem to make the figures up as they go along I can‚Äôt wait to switch providers.",0
"Absolutely horendous internet service.

I had engineers to my place multiple times saying it is fixed and the internet drops a few days later. Everytime they have the same answer, let's try to send an engineer again. 4-5 times in a row with same issue and still they will try a different engineer. And eachtime the location of the issue moves from interior to exterior.

The customer service is friendly and polite, but the actual service provided by the company is absolutely abysmal.

Also, if you move property they will raise your tarrif and you need to call to ask for refunds. They know that this happens, they even tell you when you request a change of address, but they still don't fix it. Because it is hard to solve a technical problem when you are a technology and entertainment provider. So you need to waste 1 hour on the phone to beg for a refund.

Customer Service 4/5
Actual internet service 1/5

And in all fairness, most of the issue is caused by OpenReach and the quality of their connections.",0
"I still haven‚Äôt got the order yet, that‚Äôs really cheeky to send this once I haven‚Äôt got my order, there been no one to call, I can only speak to someone via Facebook messenger, they trying to get the order, but I‚Äôve paid over a grand for the order the waiting time to get this delivered is ridiculous",0
Been two weeks and no sign of the tab active 2 I ordered. No point in blaming royal mail because they haven't received it neither. No excuse for this poor service.,0
"I had to end my contract. The speed of this ""mobile broadband"" was at times so low that it just stalled. I felt I was back in the days of modems. Horrible. If you are in a hurry, I recommend you to hold your horses and wait for an engineer to install proper broadband. I just hope they will not charge us anything as we are within their 30-day promise. If this is not the case, expect another honest review.",0
The very worst company I have ever dealt with. No use explaining my problems as it seems from other reviews this is pretty common place. A company that is obviously too big and fragmented for its own good. I will look elsewhere for a broadband supplier. One that doesn‚Äôt advertise something it cannot provide.,0
"You write a review on here and Vodafone respond ‚Äúget in touch and we‚Äôll put this right‚Äù. And then don‚Äôt.

How many hours must I spend online and on the phone trying to get Vodafone to do that to which they agreed when I took out my contract? I explained to them that I would need my master socket moving if I am to commit to a new contract ‚Äúsure, no problem‚Äù I was promised.

They are now flat out refusing to have it moved. So we can either have the internet on or the fire on, not both. Because the wire has to cross a fire to get to the electrical socket.

It‚Äôs dangerous and it‚Äôs making things difficult for us.

Avoid Vodafone at all costs, they‚Äôre dishonest and once they have your signature, you‚Äôre on your own.

Never again.",0
"Orders 900mb fibre and Tv package.

At the time of ordering I asked various questions to make sure evreything would run smoothly on the day.
Including letting them know the pole was in my neighbours garden but accessible through a side gate.

I was told an engineer would be out to survey before the job.

Today was the install day, engineers showed up and straight away said the job was getting cancelled as my neighbour wasn't home and they would need her permission to go in her garden.

They also said they would not run the cable on the side of my house and it would need to enter into a loft room. but they could leave the cable and i could run it myself.

called Bt who said it would be a further 28 days before someone could come back out.

My current Tv and broadband is due to be cut off at the end of the week.

fantastic customer service",0
Two weeks no phone no internet on and off services .,0
"Genuinely the worst company i have ever dealt with. Shockingly incompetent and even after a week has passed, i still have an unconnected phone. I've called them everyday to resolve this and haven't had a single call back. Save yourself the trouble and never deal with this genuinely awful company",0
Would give zero thanks to three and there crappy internet connection my cameras didn't work and I was stabbed by some nutter neighbour who I've never spoken to if my camera's had been working I would of been alerted to who was near my front door so having no Internet for 5 weeks also could of cost me my life thank god my contract is nearly over Disgusting company and if they bother me after my contract is over I'll sue for compensation nightmare company people do your research before having a contract with this company don't be enticed by the offers it's one big fraud. and they can stick there fake apologises.,0

"Dreadful. When you could get it to work it was a cheap form of watching the odd film ( we are not big TV users) but if it randomly decides not to work, or not to recognise you it is like having teeth pulled trying to actually contact anyone who knows anything, let alone get a solution. You can spend a day doing it. So after having paid for nothing for the last 4 months, and unable to endure a whole day trying to rectify again ( happened about a year ago as well) I have finally cancelled.",0
"I had to phone studio because my order after a week had still not been shipped apparently there was a delay but they never bothered letting me know but after I complained it arrived the new day, also with the parcel was a leaflet offering me a discount and free delivery but when I went to make an order the offer was invalid at the checkout I think this company needs a shake up, but it has lost me as a customer dreadful experience!!",0

"Further problems with leaving THREE.
When l requested my PAC l received a message with the PAC which said ""If you leave today your final bill will be ¬£0""

No point in querying it with customer services as they are a waste of space . Just glad to be rid.",0
"I ordered a washer/dryer on 27/01/23 which was delivered on the 30/02/23. Only to find out it was the wrong machine, just a washing machine. We called the customer service and just went round in circles. Nobody could help or take ownership of the issue. We did not receive a confirmation email to show the machine details that were being delivered, but did receive a txt message with the delivery detail. We have asked for the correct machine to be delivered and the incorrect one be taken away. But Curry‚Äôs have said the email on the account is incorrect, which I don‚Äôt know how as the email address has been the same for several years. Now as in today they have sent an email to say the the washing machine is being delivered tomorrow, but looking at the details of this delivery it is the same machine that we are waiting for them to collect. And nobody is able to instruct the cancellation of the machine that is being delivered and change this for the correct machine. The service has been appalling, causing anxiety due to the time it take to speak to somebody directly, then for them to be unhelpful.",0
My now tv stick doesn't work customer service awful not helpful at all wouldn't replace it disgusting service,0
"Absolutely disgusting company.
There is always an issue when I call them, almost as though it behoves them to infuriate people.
The connection is rubbish and the service is slow yet it is so expensive and the lack for luster response from the agents is even worse.
Today I receive notice about turning off WiFi calling which I did not; nonetheless my service was being a bit slow i restarted my phone only to find these dimwits have disconnected me without pre warning despite claiming to have done so I have receive not a letter text or email with regard to this.
I am a single parent who works full time and my child is under 10.
I am now uncontactable due to this oversight in Vodafone‚Äôs part.
The last major issue I had with this company was when my grandmother passed and me phone was broken they attempted to charge me to back up my phone despite the fact that they already get ¬£85 a month from me, inclusive of insurance.
They are snake oil salesmen.
Unethical and immoral practices and judging by all these reviews clearly it is not just me.
I am now awaiting my services to be reconnected but in all honesty I do not intend to continue giving this company money wasted 9 years with this network and their crap.",0
"Vodafone has been great, I've been with them for about 8 years no problems. I just noticed today that I have missed payment which I paid promptly. My problem with Vodafone is how in their very first message telling me I missed a payment they threaten to send debt collectors. Here's an exact quote from their email

""We still haven't received a payment for your Device Plan.

Unfortunately, if you don't pay this as soon as possible, we may have to pass your account onto a debt collection agency.""

No other company that I am aware would do this. You'd expect something like

""It looks like you've missed a payment, it's okay please follow the link to pay now or contact us if you have any questions.""

I just felt really uncomfortable reading their email. Made me feel as if they're threatening me because they wanted to intimidate me and like they think I can't afford it or something so they'll send bailiffs round to get it from me.

BTW my missed payment was ¬£9. Not exactly worth sending a bailiff out to collect ¬£9. It was a genuine mistake and the second I noticed I'd missed the payment I paid. Threats were totally uncalled for and unnecessary.

Oh and I'm about a year ahead of where I'm supposed to be with my payment schedule. So I'm on track to pay my device plan a year early.",0
"Absolutely shocking customer service!!!
I have sent countless emails regarding an order number 18866276
I‚Äôve yet to receive a reply and have had to buy another set of straighteners for my daughter‚Äôs gift!!!!
I‚Äôve tried to call numerous times and cannot I‚Äôm just diverted to the email system!
I ordered the same product from John Lewis and received it 48hrs later.",0
"Disgusting ""customer service"".
I pay for the Extended Warranty for peace of mind. Because I have a disability & health conditions requiring the washing machine daily.
My washing machine broke on 02.11.2020. Currys sent a very unprofessional 3rd party company eventually on 20.11.20. He had an unnamed tatty van, no uniform, no ID, and no PPE in the middle of a pandemic! He stated it was irreparable. It still took until 30.11.20 to deliver a new machine. Which the delivery driver showed me was damaged, dented with black scuffs!
But I had been without a washing machine for 28 days! Despite constantly explaining about my disability. Covid cannot be blamed for such abhorrent customer service. It is no excuse. 28 days was unacceptable.
Ryan - contacting social media is a waste of time. Responses are either an automated response or are completely ignored. I have spent hours telephoning your ""Customer Service"" and nothing has been resolved by agents.",0
"Package sent out, came damaged. Asked for a replacement, you guys put an old address for re delivery, I had to manually change to my current address which the original package was sent to. About 2 weeks later I get a message about delivery then within the hour I had a letter to say I missed it. Was I supposed to stay home for 2 weeks till my new one came down? Have bought thousands worth of tools from this website but not one bit happy with how I‚Äôve been looked after.
If I‚Äôve been given a broken tool it should be replaced no questions asked.",0
"Horrible , scams , thief , the worst company to ever exist! Absolutely evil . Worse customer service ever ! I don‚Äôt know who works at the company but they have no hearts I doubt they are even human. They made the mistake of giving their rider wrong contact details to contact me on and this was a third party driver so no tracking available.. and the driver didn‚Äôt call me on my phone and claimed to have delivered my orde I have cctv ! There was no rider at my address but deliveroo will lie and say that the rider came . Been 8 days still trying to get my refund they are trying to deny their mistake",0
Needed my laptop repairing after the back case had popped out and needed a new hinge. Assured me that it would be done in 7 days and if it hadn‚Äôt they would give a replacement product in that time. 7 days have come and I had only then been informed that the part they needed is out of stock and they‚Äôll get back to me with a date. B****cks company with a b****cks service don‚Äôt trust them I needed my laptop as uni is just starting and I heavily NEED my laptop these spastics can‚Äôt even do that in the time frame given and have stressed me out before uni‚Äôs even started. I urge you do not use this number b*lls**t company and just got someplace else it‚Äôll probably take them another week to tell me they‚Äôve only just got the part in and another week after that to tell them they‚Äôre sending it back to me bunch of tosspots. Yours sincerely Vijay,0
"I was told as a business account customer they could offer a deal of free broadband for a year. I switched over and this is where the problems started. The main issue, they sent me a bill? (it was supposed to be free for a year) they have charged yet again. This would be the sixth time I‚Äôve contacted, they advised ‚Äòthey would listen to the phone call promising free broadband‚Äô. I‚Äôve been promised a phone call back with a resolution for just over a month and still not received this! To make matters worse they keep restricting my phone and broadband (I work from home). I will now be heading to trading standards. I would suggest going elsewhere!!",0

However, on Thursday 14th our WiFi went down, I had to check what was going on and they stated the problem would be fixed on Friday evening, however it is now Sunday 17th and it is still down, with no updates at all from BT about what is going on, they keep saying on their website that the problem will be fixed but it doesn't and everytime I go to check again it keeps on moving either back a date, BT are now saying it won't be sorted out until The 19th, which is unacceptable, paying for a service that doesn't work, it wouldn't surprise me if they're doing this on purpose to make people spend more money to upgrade.",0
Next time if u sell a product make sure u giving the right cables since my product only runs with a 3.0 USB cable and not a USB 2.0. This made it look like the product was broken and made me use more money to get the proper cable for it.,0

After 20 minutes of waiting on hold, each person you're passed to tells you different things, each told me I was on a differnt contract, then no contract at all etc. Then I look at my bank statement and I've been charged loads because apparently I was put on a contract even though the whole reason I went with now tv was because they offer no contract deals.

Cancelled my plan with them two months ago and have just seen that they are still taking money from my bank.",0

"Avoid Vodafone, because they have a very unhelpful technical team and terrible customer service. The 5GHz works ok but we can't use 2.4GHz since changing broadband to Vodafone, but our 2.4GHz devices are working ok at other places: friend's home, parent's home, etc. We made at least 9 phone calls and wasted 18 hours talking to their technical staff and customer services. After they couldn't solve the issue, they blamed it on our devices - which worked perfectly before and anywhere else now. We tried to request a new router but I think it wasn't accepted because we haven't received anything so far. Every time we called, Vodafone insisted the router is fine when we are having problems with it. Only 1 time we were suggested that upgrading the package may help, but after being transferred to the department, the staff was terrible - she tried to send us back to the technical team and didn't listen to our requests at all. When we finally had enough of her and said ""we want to leave vodafone"" and guess what, she transferred us back to the technical team!!! I'll have to tell anyone who considering using Vodafone broadband: don't! and run as fast as you can because if you have any issue, they can't solve it and will just waste your life.",0
Really disappointed. The delivery was as expected and I‚Äôd paid for unpacking. They left some packaging on the path (polystyrene) and then when the electrician came to fit it we found that they hadn‚Äôt unpacked one piece so the appliance couldn‚Äôt be fitted. When I rang up to explain I was told to ring the manufacturers directly I did so but the part will not be delivered until at least a week after the original delivery. That‚Äôs a week without a fridge. AO have been notified but no response whatsoever.,0
Robbed yet again but charged for items from deliveroo Morrisons Castle Brom. Would give negative stars if I could.,0
"They don‚Äôt even deserve a single star, we‚Äôve had a care plan for over 2 years, paid consistently and they didn‚Äôt even repair the laptop ON ITS FIRST EVER REPAIR!! Used the same old parts, very disappointed with the customer service and I will quickly cancel all 4 of my current care plans as they are useless and don‚Äôt do anything, DONT BUY A CARE PLAN and I will never buy a single care plan from team know how or Currys ever again, I recommend using a third party insurer for products which include water damage protection aswell, much better value and they ACTUALLY FIX the products.",0
"What a joke of a company. I had an engineer booked for 22nd Dec. 1pm -6pm. They did not turn up but falsified they had.

"Terrible service. Ordered a fridge from Currys which arrived damaged in multiple places. I've been bounced between different operators to confirm my details about 3 times, and every time they asked for some new details. After trying to arrange a replacement with a third party (they did not take responsibility for it) They offered a refund of initially ¬£30 then ¬£50, that it does not in any way make up for the damage, but due to these difficult time caused by COVID-19 I decided to accept. It's been 3 months since delivery and still nothing. They have not replied to my emails in the last 2 months.

"Ordered broadband, to then find out I have to wait 3 weeks before installation. Not a good start. Installation day came, the guy plugged the broadband in and wired up as needed. Then told me the main port unit has no available ports for us. Told us they will be back the next day to do that. Then I spent every single day on the phone with these guys for 10 days - every day basically being told they come 'tomorrow'. Eventually the one helpful customer services lady told me it can be weeks or months before a port will become available (when people end broadbands) - and that they are not actually adding any new ones. Why no one said that from the start!? Order cancelled straight away. Will not buy any NOWTV products. Poor show.",0

I ordered it with the promise it would be dispatched in 7-10 working days. 3 weeks had gone and still no phone so I complained and they asked me if I would like I refund so I said yes and bought a phone from elsewhere. It is now 18th March 2021 and still no refund and no phone obviously! We have had to now put a claim through to bank and contact trading standards. We have emailed Atleast 15-20 times. In each email they have promised us we will be refunded at a later date giving us a date, each time was 2 weeks later then going onto January we was told by the end of feb, then still no refund so we was told on or before the 17th March. It is now the 18th and still no money. Absolute joke, quick enough to take money but don‚Äôt have the decency especially in the current circumstances to refund money owed for a devise which wasn‚Äôt sent!! I am currently on maternity leave and this amount of money was my only savings for my leave and it has been withheld off me from the start of my leave in September to the end of my leave March!! Please please do not order from them, it will be a huge mistake",0

Have made 5 calls to the customer service department, plus had 2 web chats and nobody can tell me where my 3rd item is. I have requested a call from management, however that has not happened either. I am now on hold yet again whilst i am being bounced between departments - 1h23 minutes so far today...! Terrible service with nobody taking ownership of my issue.",0

"My broadband and phone have been cut all the time during 2022 due to intensive work all the year in my area...I called Virgin to complain and was told i ll et compensation for all the days there will be a cut...and that i didnt need to call them back as they could trace all and the person on the phone reassured me...I n reality i got only 2 days compensation for a minimum of 3 months regular cuts...so they ACTUALLY TOOK INTO ACCOUNT ONLY THE last 2 DAYS i complained and called despite what they said. I m also very ill with cancer but everytime they remove me from priority list...the phone and broadband was often cut at night but not only and that was a reall struggle for my health as i need phone to work for health reasons...Despite all i tried to renew but customer service was embarrassed and they didnt call me back for "" weeks to sort out the issues...they knew i was right cause i had already a partial refund for same issues months before ...same story i had to fight to get only few days but was still better than now...Virgin just called me to sal eme a new packae and now they pretend they wont call me back before end of month but i know they wont i spoke to too may people they arent concerned...the policy is disgusting and not fair .i should call every day it doesn't works sometimes many times a day and still they would not refund me what the owe...very bad experience not talking about the rest

ps Virgin now send automatic response as below to check their customer policy but they dont even read the messages and complaints or respond after that ...just loss of time policy is to refund maxi,um 2 days doesnt matter if you have cuts all the time...they just dont respond or deny you even compalined all the dirty tricks to avoid to pay..Customers always pay but they dont even follow their owns rules!!!not even trying to fix things nowodays...it was bad before but now its more than worse they dont care about customers...",0

"Made the mistake (I knew it would end in disaster) of signing up for NOW TV on a trial. They then set up multiple accounts so when I cancelled there was still a live account. Unbelievable I know. After much anguish and many calls, they finally cancelled both and refunded me. But this hasn't stopped payments being taken. Now I find I have a recurring payment of ¬£5 from SKY TV on my bank account. SKY TV and NOW TV tell me they cannot find an account for me or remove this recurring payment. Barclays very helpfully tell me they can't remove it but suggest I keep looking in case another ¬£5 is taken. For the rest of my life presumably. If you want to retain your sanity, avoid SKY TV and NOW TV and don't ever give them your bank details.",0

Awful experience with this company. Purchased a pixel 7 pro on 17th October with a guaranteed trade in of ¬£150 for my old phone. Never recieved the trade in pouch. Despite numerous call to their south African call centre (who couldn't care less or have no idea what I am talking about) I have been unable to trade in my phone. No one replies to emails either. Avoid at all costs,0
"BT service was faultless for 3&1/2 years until I got a text telling me that someone wanted to take over my service. I replied to all messages letting them know I was not moving or changing provider. I also spoke to customer services and was reassured that everything was ok and not to worry!
Yet I received a letter telling me my account would be closed in a week. I then phoned customer services and explained the situation to which I was told my account was closed last month!
I was told the only way to rectify this was to set up a new 24 month account which I didn‚Äôt want to do.
I was then told that any new account for less than 24 months would have to be authorised by senior management and would call back the following day. What a surprise, no call back !! I then called customer services again to be told there was nothing they could do and no supervisor was in the office.
I have now found a new supplier and a better deal!!
I expected better from a so called British institution, DISAPPOINTED!",0
"I requested a refund back in October. There were a few complications as i had taken over my mothers account due to ill health. After repeatedly advising Shell Energy on the phone and via the Chat were to pay the money into they decided to pay the money into an account i told them was in the process of being closed
To add insult to injury they decided to raise a second credit ( i didnt request) and pay that into the same account
It appears to me that there is a complete lack of communication between departments. I have lost track of how many times they were given the information only to ignore it
I received a phone call (one of many) from customers services who were very apologetic and who said they would look into it immediately and get back to me. Its now been 4 days and nothing
I am at a loss for words of how a simple task can be mishandled.
To use another companies advert ""its good to talk""
maybe Shell need to look at their procedures",0
"Absolutely shocking customer services from the live chat bot. Order was over an hour late and rider was still being assigned, food ready for that long is going to be cold.

Ordered an iPhone 12 contract paid the upfront cost and was told it would be delivered the following day which was great. It was supposed to be delivered between 1-3 pm it didn‚Äôt. I then got a text to say it was being sent back to the shop due to failing the credit score? I then questioned this and asked for a refund they told me I‚Äôd receive my refund in 3-5 working days. 3 weeks later I called to chase this so called refund up and was told my account has been locked due to failing my security questions and that I can‚Äôt get a refund until it‚Äôs unlocked! So just to confirm. I didn‚Äôt receive my refund or the phone. Will never use this company nor recommend it. Only reason why I did order from you on the first place was to get a phone on contract quick before my brother went away.,0
"Suffering the same login issues that many are experiencing and cannot access any of the TV channels I am paying for. But they continue taking payment for a service that I and many others are not receiving. Don't get me started on the Sky Sports situation.

KEEP CLEAR DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.",0
"Team know how were supposed to deliver and install a washing machine we purchased from Currys. Yesterday someone called and said they would txt one hour before arrival. No one texted, but I apparently missed their calls (all within 3 minutes window). When I called 5 min afterwards no one answered. They left a message saying they cannot get hold of us and we need to rearrange the delivery. We were home all this time. No one came. They decided not to show up based on unanswered calls all within 3 minutes. Unacceptable customer service. When I called Currys they couldn't rearrange and told me to call back tomorrow.

"Ordered a phone on the 9th which said 1-2 weeks delivery time. The next day, it said 4-7 days. Waited 4-7 days and that has been and gone so I phoned MPD and asked how it changed so quickly, was told depends on stock levels. I stated that it has been over 7 days now and asked when my phone will arrive? ‚ÄòIt‚Äôll be 4-7 days‚Äô. So basically they just keep extending the waiting time by 4-7 days over and over so who knows when it will arrive. Almost tempted to just wait for the new Samsung to be released next year at this rate‚Ä¶ Extremely annoyed as well because I was due to get an extra ¬£150 cash back but that offer expires 31st and I need my new phone‚Äôs IMEI number so I can apply!!

Already know I‚Äôll probably get a generic reply to this post like all the others below ‚Äòit depends on stock levels‚Äô and only an estimated time.‚Äô Well MPD, you shouldn‚Äôt be falsely giving a date- you should only be selling if you can guarantee a date of when the phones will be here. Also quick enough to take an upfront payment? Not happy at all. Will wait until tomorrow until 2 weeks have gone by and cancel order if phone hasn‚Äôt arrived. Don‚Äôt have high hopes as I have been checking the website and now there isn‚Äôt even an option for the phone colour and GB I ordered.

Avoid this company at all costs.",0
"Service severed by BT engineers. BT refuse all efforts for explanation of charges still made. Assurance that final bill will allow for refunds. Final bill received - no refunds. Consumer team changed advice to 30 days for refund. No start date given. Refused to address issue. Only action is to blame Openreach - BT owned.
Customer team responses were unidentified including using the wrong name for me. When I said I was despairing suddenly I was threatened with security by some one who suddenly signed off with a name and has closed the conversation.
I have yet to find a complaints process yet now closed out!

Cheery response from BT - just contact BT! I've been doing that since 18th October and nothing has been achieved. Generic responses at best as just now and aggression at worst are all you get. No attempts to address the problems.",0
"Ghd attitude towards customer service is apalling. They claim next day delivery, but I had to wait almost 1 month and the item never arrived. They blamed the delivery courier, but it is clear from the parcel tracking that the courier never received it either. If you telephone their customer service team they put you on hold for up to 1/2 hour listening to really bad music. However if you phone their place an order line they manage to answer the phone straight away. How can this be? They either don‚Äôt care about their customers or are receiving so many complaints they cannot cope with them. After waiting an extortionate amount of time for the product to arrive before finding out they had not sent it I had no option but to ask for a refund, and had to ask them again and again. They take your money really quickly and then hold onto it for as long as they possibly can. A disgusting company to deal with. I will never buy anything from them again.",0
"eSpares have recently gone ""entirely digital"". When calling their customer support line it suggests to email or use the live chat service.

I was understanding up until now but then I saw the other reviews on here and realised they're still taking orders when they have outstanding orders they have not fulfilled from 2 months to go.

Contacted support who said it would be credited back to my account... guess what? It wasnt.

Contacted support again today who said there was no record of my past conversations and they wouldn't be giving me my money back.

Hours wasted, money lost, and a rubbish experience.

Don't bother with them. Customer service is abysmal and what you save in a few quid each month you will pay for with extra charges and the time you spend on talking to their ""support"".

"teamknowhow are the worst delivery company you can get. I will never buy from currys again or from any company whose delivery or support is managed by them.
their delivery drivers are saying no o deliver a fridge up 6 steps! so they put z fridge in a van for delivery and expect all purchases of American fridges to live in a house with no stairs. teamknowhow setup and support is unprofessional. I order an American fridge and the driver said it is too big too carry up 6 steps or downt 6 steps. i paid specifically extra for installation and removal. i rang them to say what kind of company sends people with American fridges to deliver and not expect any steps. they basically pointed me to their t and c about what I signed up to. I told them why have a specialist delivery company that is not able to take a fridge up 6 steps?. the person then just ignored my comments and pushed my call through to complaints where i waited for 20minutes with no answer. they did not even take my order number. they just left me on my own as a customer and telling me my fridge will be left out on the front. i had already waited 4 weeks for delivery.. their own driver also said nobody cares to ask any details and we just deliver what we can. currys and teamknowhow are completely disconnected.
Do not purchase from currys as they know about teamknowhow and choose to continue with such a bad company and do not purchase from any company that chooses them as it only shows they only care about selling not delivery the product or a acceptable service. I have to elderly people, a life essential of a fridge and they send no one with delivery skills for large objects. crazy company. they just a mini cab service for products. no specialty in anything.",0
"I was with bt for over a year and fro start to finish I had problems with my direct debit date.despit repeated calls to amend the date of my direct debit this was not allowed. Managers agreed there was no reason as to why I couldn't change the date of my payments. Every month I would get restrictions placed onto my on my account where by this affected my work as I work form home, late fees applied also, I would call explain that a mid month payment was causing me financial issues and that I need my date amended to the 1st of the month, after approx 9 months of struggling with this I then decided to change contract mid month as the stress was getting too much especially during a pandemic when companies were meant to be helping. Despite all this complaints get closed after the call ended even though I have not been satisfied with the resolution provided time and time again. Agents have agreed and said on calls numerous times my account was a shambles and that there was no reason why I couldn't amend the date.

I also had service issues as well with the broadband

I left and changed provider and are now trying to dispute the remaining charges and get told that the complaints procedure stops at the agent once the call has finished and that there is no further complaints procedure to follow to escalate.

I will now be taking this further and I am not happy with the service provide or how my complaint had been dealt with",0

Let's start with my journey which i am still trying to get out of and has cost me money.
So... bought a phone online, they advertised extra ¬£100 if you chose the option to trade in at the same time Samsung phone. but website also advised if I traded in that day they would give me an extra ¬£100 bonus, good deal I thought... waited nearly 2 weeks for the trade in box to send my old phone back but nothing, called up and they said they knew nothing about the trade in?? You will have to start again. Bear in mind you only get the extra trade off ¬£100 when you trade in your old Samsung for a new one and send old one back in 7 days!! On the phone for a further 9 times then they finally found my info...but said start again and we will if you use the same email give you ¬£100 extra. After 11 days of lies and also live chat and emsils i had No option but to cancel my new contract as i was in my 14 days colling off. Did they make it easy no. I took my number over to I D Mobile from Sky. Now want that back as i will be going back to Sky Mobile. CPW Call Centre said i have to wait 3 days for the phone to arrive with them anf the a further 5 days for them to let id mobile know before i can even apply for my puc code to get my number back. Took 2 hours to sort out. spend a further 30mins getting through on the phone each time then they end the call if it sounds to difficult to deal with and you have to start over again, I‚Äôm probably never go near this company again. Trade in deal a scam you won't get the extra money on trade in and the correct value of the phone you send back big con please stay away. Whole espsode has been horrendous. I phoned i d mobile off my phone by dealing 7777 and this was a uk call center told them i had sent my phone back and was leaving he asked why and i told him. He said totally understand said about a puc code to get my number back he said you have to call Car Phone Warehouse oh God!!! AVOID! By the way asked to talk to a Supervisor or Manager 8 times and the call handler will not let you talk to them or even escalate them.Update still no response from CFW after phone sent back, no email or anything to say contract cancelled or refund. Trying to get my number back also not happening. Don't bother with the email for response from Jim as that is also a load of rubbish as when you reply they don't get back to you.

It didn't arrive and after contacting them they could not guarantee a delivery date, so I cancelled the order. I then had to contact somenody else in the company to process the cancellation and was told they would process refund. Nothing arrived in December so after chasing again I was told it would be paid on or before 9th Feb. That came and no refund and the next response was a word for word replica of previous email but saying it would be paid on or before 9th March. They are obviously blaming the pandemic but I've seen a Facebook group set up for complainants and this has been going on for years. I'd recommend avoid this company",0
"My contract is coming to an end. I shopped around to find a better deal and decided to cancel my Virgin Media phone and broadband service. During my contract with Virgin I had poor service and was just waiting for my contract to be over.

But the retention department as a whole is awful and very disrespectful to my decision to cancel. I felt as if they were forcing me to stay with Virgin media. They don't take no for an answer and refused to cancel.

I communicated with Mayette at the retention team via WhatsApp messaging services. I had to repeatedly tell Mayette at the retention team to cancel my contract as I m not interested. But I feel he was interrogating me as he refused to listen to me and kept asking why I wanted to cancel? It was very frustrating. I asked if I can speak to his manager but again he kept ignoring my request and refused me to speak with his manager.

I couldn't believe what was going on and decided to phone Virgin Media, hoping it will be different. Spoke to an agent identifying as Billy from retention, but he was just the same, refusing to cancel and just hung up on me, after about 10-15 mins.

I phoned back again and spoke to an agent identifying as JL from retention and again similar attitude but managed to get it cancelled.

It took me 5-6 hours to cancel a residential broadband contract, which was coming to an end within a month. Disgusting.

I must also mention that the call centre is abroad and sometimes difficult to understand what they were saying. But I just wanted to cancel.",0

They told me to try this and try that, which didn‚Äôt solve the problem so they phoned Sony who said they would ring me the next day. They didn‚Äôt. This happened three times so after a month of being no nearer fixing the problem we went back to Curry‚Äôs. I spoke to a manager and pointed out that the extra cover states that if a fault developes within thirty days of purchase I am entitled to exchange it for a new TV. The manager said it is now over thirty days so can‚Äôt do that. So even if you have a problem in the first thirty days they will just fob you off until the time is up. I immediately cancelled my cover and would advise anyone not to pay for this although they will push it at the time of purchase and promise all sorts. They don‚Äôt do what they say they will.

"I've had 5 engineers out to fix my washing machine. It's still not fixed. The last engineer left without doing anything. He only had on his system that one engineer had been before (the first) so couldn't see what the previous engineer did. I call the office and they only had 4 call outs booked (including the one that day).
The engineer said I might have multiple accounts, if someone types my name different when reporting the job etc. I always use the same login.
The engineer left without booking a future appt because there were no options to book. Its been over 3 months and the issue is still not sorted. I question whether it would be more cost effective to just get a new washing machine. I'm still waiting for someone to call me back. I was informed someone would cal me back within 24hrs. It's been 48 hours.
Terrible experience",0

"Reading through the reviews and seeing a lot of negative reviews, and I could not agree more! ordered a phone well over 2 and a bit months ago, having to email them every other week because there had been no sign of my phone, and would receive no contact from quickmobilefix with no updates about the phone I had purchased unless i contacted them first! After 2 months had passed and still no phone, I have finally had enough and asked for my money back, I am now worried after seeing other reviews that they are equally as slow to give the money back, even though they are quick enough to take it! I can appreciate that times are tough for business's due to covid 19, but the company had left no indication on their website to show that it would take longer than usual for the phone to arrive but nearly 3 months is a bit excessive, and would not have given quick mobile fix my money if I had known the issues that would come my way. I hope that it does not take the same amount of time for them to give my money back as they did with the phone i purchased, as it looks like i will never have my money back, ¬£450 is a lot of money for myself, so im just hoping as a saving grace they will give my back within the 14 days they promised.",0

Six months later they decided to decline my cashback without any explanation. I am disgusted to say the least. I feel that I've been scammed.

Avoid this company.",0
"I recently left a bad review for Baxi I now understand this was unfair as they subcontract out warranty & repairs to D&G, this company is a joke & I suspect Baxi will loose a lot of customers for the service provided by them.

First off I called 5 months ago to activate my 10 year warranty for my new boiler I was told this was now completed & they offered me a service plan, I was a little reluctant as I wanted to use my local plumber who installed my unit, after some persuasion I expected.
5 months later I have an issue with my boiler I called D&G & to my astonishment they cannot find me on their records after some investigation there end they find some of my details under an incorrect surname (easy mistake) they delete the record & create me a new one (so I‚Äôm told). A service engineer visited my premises & the repair couldn‚Äôt be done as the parts
Are not in stock, no info or ETA was provided & im now left with no heating or hot water & no time frame I call D&G to express my concerns & mention my warranty & there response was I have no 10 years only the 3 years manufactured warranty stress & anxiety quickly turns to sickness as I felt conned by the previous operator 5 months ago.
(Surprise surprise D&G cannot fix this)
Second issue I try to manage my account online & im told my details do not match when creating the account, after calling D&G again I‚Äôm told all should be ok try again in 24hrs, after trying again online I get another error message too many attempts made call a number (that doesn‚Äôt work)
I call D&G yet again & now I‚Äôm offered an email address to contact but guess what a response from the customer care email is a redirect stating that the email service has been stopped.
I am now at my wits end, I would happily rip out my new ‚Äú10 year‚Äù boiler & replace it so I don‚Äôt have to contact these incompetent clowns again.",0
"Mazuma must be under new management OR feeling the pinch as they now claim scratches on devices that DO NOT EXIST in order to reduce their offer to you and keep more profit.

"Been using the same VM router for a couple of years. Service goes down sometimes but not terrible. Suddenly no broadband. Called support. Not a fault, just that someone had marked the router as not valid on the network - no idea why and support admitted just a mistake by their 'engineers'. Support were useless - well trained in 'I'm so sorry to hear that..' but it just makes it worse that they'd been trained in that but not in actually solving the problem. First call, it will be back in 24 hours, then 24 hours later, back in another 24 hours, then 24 hours later, maybe 3 - 5 days, then maybe you'll have to wait until a technician brings you a new router. Their idea of a callback is one ring so the number is registered as a call but not long enough to answer. Such slack engineering and an absence of customer support is not good enough with broadband so central to working from home. Avoid.

UPDATE: The reply from VM perfectly encapsulates their approach to customer service. Rather than paying attention to my situation and offering a genuine response which might lead to a solution, VM support just spouts a lot of boilerplate scripts and nonsense about how sorry they are. It must have been a 'frustrating experience'. Yes Beth it is - not was - because approaching a week later, it's still not working. Next time you reply to someone, please read what was written before copy/pasting standard solutions about area outages etc. - none of which applied if you'd read my message. I'd give them zero if I could. I'll certainly be looking into other service providers.

UPDATE 2: Two weeks later VM made exactly the same mistake of disabling my router on their network meaning I now have no broadband for an estimated 8 days. That an active router on an active account can be disabled shows how poor their 'engineering' teams are. Their systems must be completely disconnected from each other so that they have no joined up view of an active customer. The worst thing is that whenever I tell clients or colleagues that I can't work because I have no broadband, the response 9/10 times is 'Are you with VM by any chance?' They have such a poor reputation for reliability that no-one is surprised by my experience. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid",0

"I began my relationship with Shell after my previous energy supplier went bust in 2021.
Now, let me be honest; there‚Äôs absolutely no way I would‚Äôve decided to join if I was given a choice .
It seemed to take an age to get my account sorted, in fact there was a tariff change during this period, add to this they used the incorrect reads to open my account (it could be argued that the fault lay at my previous suppliers feet), and took numerous emails, a seemingly endless supply of broken promises and a staggering 4 months to rectify.
The issues don‚Äôt end there.
The app and website are really poorly designed and down for maintenance all too frequently between updates. It also seems very centred on smart meter users. It shows bills have been issued but you can‚Äôt open them for a day or two. What is good about it is; when you give a read you have up until midnight on the day you submitted to change it (thanks to my fat fingers I really should make more use of this feature).
Their bills are another concern. They follow the same theme as their online presence. I find them extremely difficult to understand and the information is displayed in such a way It makes me think they‚Äôve done it deliberately to befuddle and confuse the customer.
In the 16 months I‚Äôve been with them, I‚Äôve felt it necessary to raise enquiries 16 times by email (with quite a few other times on the phone), resulting in an average wait time of 51 days to rectify the issue satisfactorily (this includes 2 enquiries still outstanding with 372 and 280 days respectively (if they can‚Äôt figure your problem out it appears they bury their head in the sand)).
The standard response to all enquiries is that they are extremely busy and appreciate patience. This leads me to believe they are either extremely short staffed or incompetent at doing their job.
I wouldn‚Äôt advise anyone to join this company of their own free will.
Edit - 18/01/23 (Please note the aforementioned ‚Äúextremely busy‚Äù excuse in their reply (if you can see it)).
As if to prove how poor their customer service is; Shell took this review and somehow interpreted it as a recent event (does it read like that? I don‚Äôt think so) and emailed me repeatedly asking for opening reads. I asked them to explain and all they could say was ‚Äùbecause we want them‚Äù (I‚Äôm paraphrasing). I had to remind them that I have been a customer since 2021. They've got my head done in.
Edit - 25/01/23.
I understand that you feel compelled to solve your customers problems, however, this site is where customers can leave their opinions about entities that supply them with goods and/or services. It is not somewhere (at least it shouldn't be) they instigate any complaints they have had recently (there are other platforms for that). As I have previously mentioned above (and in the unnecessary amount of emails you've decided to send) my open read issue no longer exists.
You are not helping and I can't remove any further stars.
I cannot stipulate this enough:
Avoid this lot like the proverbial.
Sara - PLEASE STOP ARRANGING FOR 'ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES TO CONTACT ME' REGARDING THIS REVIEW.",0

"AVOID Now Broadband services at all cost. Without a doubt the most useless customer service you will ever encounter. So bad they should rename the department Customer Disservice!

I‚Äôve been having broadband issues for over a month. I‚Äôve had 3 separate engineers booked, and 2 more that didn‚Äôt even bother turning up.

There are 2 major issues with this provide.

1 - they are reliant on the Openreach network so if it‚Äôs an external issue they will always take 3-5 working days to resolve it. If the engineers don‚Äôt turn up in that time or the issue isn‚Äôt fixed the only thing they will do is re-book another engineer and you have to wait another 3-5 working days. Out of 4 call outs so far only 2 have turned up, so you only have a 50/50 chance of it happening.

2. The complete incompetence of the customer service team at Now broadband. Every time you call you speak to an adviser they say they will call you back to check that the issue has been resolved. Out of the 8 CS people I spoke to only one bothered to call me back. If you want to speak to a supervisor you can‚Äôt because apparently they don‚Äôt supply them with headphones to make outgoing calls. I asked to make a formal complaint and have all my calls listed to. Was advised this could take up to about a week but that a supervisor would call me back. Unable to give a specific time. I never received that call.

Every agent you speak to will swear they will call you back and that they take pride in their job. Don‚Äôt believe it. They will usually tell you they would call you back but they‚Äôre now off shift for a number of days but they will make sure someone will call you back. The CS agents all agree the service isn‚Äôt good enough but there is nothing they can do about it.

Save your money and time - go with any provider other than Now broadband. Life is too short to wast hours on a phone with such a poor service provider.",0
"Recommended BT to my brother in law and partner- very bad decision. They are new customers, booked installation and home expert to set it all up - nobody arrived, no explanation.

"The whole Now TV menu set up and access to it all is absolutely crap. It makes me sorry to have even watched it. It is so confused. The help section is bollicks. It strings you into circular dizzyness of help typical of all of these companys would provide crap websites so they don't have to answer proper questions. They don't really give a rats ass about what your question might be or how to answerr it. There are no changes or improvements to the site ever.
Very typical of SKY throughout the world really. If you want, or god help us, 'expect' decent HD viewing you have to pay extra to view it. HD TV as we know it has been around for 11 years and Sky still give cusmoers crap decoders and supply low quality tV and coverage to everyone unless you pay them extra.",0
"Once I was proud to call myself a Three customer, having been with the network for over a decade. As time has gone on this has soured, but this last year has pushed me to finally give up on this company, with two main reasons.

1) The ""Upgrade"" options I have been presented with have been absolutely atrocious. I can go to a 3rd Party Network that piggybacks off Three and get a better deal (Smarty, for reference). When I asked what they could do, they couldn't even match what was being offered elsewhere. After the length of time and the amount of money I've poured into Three, I'd expect something half decent for an upgrade, instead I felt flat out unvalued and frankly insulted.

2) The main reason is that without warning or reason, I found the last voicemail from my deceased grandfather deleted from my voicemails. When I contacted their customer support I got neither explanation or apology, instead having the issue swept to the side and all but ignored. That was one of very, very few recordings of his voice I still had, and now it's gone, thanks to Three.

I cannot remember the last time a company made me feel so belittled and demeaned. I'll be switching network before my next bill is in, and taking most my family with me.

Absolutely disgraceful how far this company has fallen.

Edit: To address the response from Three, the voice mail was saved. Every time I listened to it I made sure to save it, yet it was still deleted without any warning or reason.

Also, every attempt I have made to use the Web chat linked, I keep getting told ""try again later"". I am not expending any further energy on your company like this when you have caused me more than enough stress. You have my contact details from the review, you can reach out to me to address this issue.

All your reply has done is further wound me up, the attempts at gaslighting by making it sound as if I don't know how to save a voicemail are completely unneeded. If you truly value your customers, don't just pay lip-service as a review reply and actually go out your way to contact the customer and address the issue.

If I could I would happily drop this review down to 0 stars now, or even put it in the negative!",0

I had online courses booked in to retrain and support my family. As TKH could not confirm the turn around time of the required repair and would not offer a refund, I had no choice but to purchase another laptop. I have since returned the faulty laptop and received it back today. TKH says the fault is not covered by the warranty and I should contact Dell. Even more concerning is that the laptop was delivered back to me by a TKH worker not wearing PPE and stood at my doorstep. The Laptop has been returned without the box, instructions and CHARGER!!

"I am absolutely disgusted with the call handler I have just spoken to. She was rude and implied I was lying.
I called to raise a concern about a charge on my bill which was outside of my agreed contract price. The call handler said there was nothing she could do about the charge, which was an extra ¬£16 for unlimited UK landlines calls. I was informed when I took the contract out I would not have to pay this fee and I would get the service for free. This is because I was ending a previous contract early and upgrading to 'full fibre. The discount was on my previous contract and I was told I could keep this discount.
She implied I was lying about this. I said I wanted to escalate my complaint because she was unable to handle the complaint and I asked for an email address so that I could put my complaint into writing and she hung up the call! Just like that.
What a horrible rude woman she was.
And I am nowhere nearer to resolving my complaint.
With regards to the full fibre - what a joke that is! My Internet has never been so unstable and unreliable as it is now. I wish I had never gone through this 'upgrade' process because it is more like a downgrade. Our WiFi constantly drops out now we have full fibre and this affects our home security system. This happens daily. Also we get a lot of buffering and delays when watching TV (iPlayer for example). We can no longer use our home telephone because the telephone point is not compatible with the full fibre and the full fibre connection point is in the completely wrong place, but we had no say over that. The engineer installed it and we couldn't choose where. The new connection point needs to be connected to mains electricity, they didn't tell us that. Where the engineer has installed the connection there is no power supply and we have to run an extension lead across the hallway which is a trip hazard.
We are so disappointed with Talk Talk and the bad service they have provided.",0

It was back and forth like this with the time getting later and later for delivery. At 7:25pm I get a call from where I had ordered from asking if I had got my food as the driver picked it up earlier. I advised that no food had arrived and I wasn't happy as I have hungry children waiting for it (it was a treat and a night off for me) I rung up Deliveroo who said they'd call the restaurant. They came back on the phone and said the restaurant tried to call me but I wasn't picking up!! So I explained that they were lying as they rang me as I spoke to them. The person at Deliveroo went off again and came back telling me she'd put the order through as delivered. I asked her why she was doing that when it clearly hasn't been delivered. She said she can void the payment that way and it jist won't go through. Now from a business point if view, how can you solve issues that arise from this if you are just masking over them? She also had the audacity to say to me that this will be logged so it doesn't happen again! Now how can this be sorted if you're lying about my complaint by saying you're going to mark it as delivered? I have recorded conversations of this and off the restaurant who called me. Shocking and its also not the first time. What I can be sure of is it will be the last time I use Deliveroo. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",0

"Broadband went down 20th/21st December. Reported early 21st. Promise to fix by end of 24th. Lots of calls from me to get an update as no communication or online tracking update at all. Finally told that an engineer had picked it up on 24th and to no surprise whatsoever it still isn't fixed. Really helpful change of date fix estimate to 28th though - that is by text and the online tracker still says it will be fixed by 24th. It is now 26th.

It would also be great if you change your customer service line that Openreach is a separate company and therefore you cannot get an update on progress. Looks like it is a wholly owned subsidiary to me and even if it wasn't my contract is with BT and not currently being fulfilled, so I'm not really interested in your corporate structure.

Edit: 27th December and no change or communication. Heading for a week in a few hours - woud be marvellous if someone could fix especially as you managed to collect my direct debit without any problem.

Edit 2: Thanks for the social media contact suggestion: I already contacted you through Twitter and no-one could help there either, although someone did send me a link to your automatic compensation webpage. I called today and was told that an engineer should be looking at it within 24-48 hours. This just isn't good enough - it has been a week now and there is no sign of any remedial action or a reliable date to fix. I'm going to ask Ofcom to take a look if it isn't fixed in the next 24 hours as that will be a second deadline missed.

This resulted in the same outcome - absolutely no help.
Then, I am told to call up to make a complaint, after another hour on the phone I'm suddenly told complaints can only be handled via email! I email the address provided and guess what... failed to deliver!

When I tried to report it there was no customer service number advertised and they kept on recommending an online line check and it kept coming back as no fault found. Eventually I searched up how to cancel the service and got through to someone but it was not resolved to my satisfaction. I definitely would not recommend this company as their customer service is so poor.,0
Prices up again and customer service down....wl be moving my contract shortly,0
"Ordered a PC on behalf of my partner and received it on 2/11. After setting it up it became clear it was faulty after it crashed when opening any browser. Was told to reinstall Windows (something we paid extra for eBuyer to do themselves) which did not work.

I then had to arrange for a return which was collected on 4/11. No update about it being received by them, had to email for any info. Turns out it was received on 6/11 but hadn't been scanned in yet. I was told this on 10/11 (what's the hold up?). It is now 19/11 and no update on anything. Now it's the weekend so nothing will happen.

My partner has lost income on this faulty item that was obviously not properly tested before it was sent out and now, over 2 weeks on, we're still none the wiser, despite contacting eBuyer multiple times.

At this point I feel eBuyer should just send a new unit out to us and call it a day. Never using them again.",0
On two occasions I have waited for an engineer to arrive to instal my landline. On both occasions I was promised the earth by BT yet no show. Two days work unpaid lost. Absolutely disgusting. As a new customer I found this shocking and would advise to avoid! Shambles. No apologies or nothing from BT then had the nerve to say if I cancelled I would be charged!!! Cancelled what??? I haven‚Äôt even got a service from them.,0
"Appalling company (owned by sky so not surprised). If you buy a card they will automatically sign you onto the paid subscription without telling you, then before you watch anything you get advertising even though you pay more than any other service and get the same amount of content.

"If I could give a minus star I would. Ordered a phone from Carphone Warehouse on 15th March. Received the SIM card but the phone didn't arrive with it on the 16th so raised the issue with them straight away. Originally I was told I'd have an email from DPD confirming the new delivery in 24 hours, nothing came. I've spent hours over the two weeks chasing the phone whereabouts being told various different timescales and lies by their shockingly bad advisors to eventually get fed up cancel it last week. No refund has been issued yet and I've now been charged a monthly bill for a phone I do not have after I was assured on many occasions I wouldn't be charged as the SIM hadn't been activated. Safe to say I will NEVER use CW again, I have never experienced such diabolical customer service from a provider in my life, it's practically daylight robbery.",0
"Only giving them one star as I can‚Äôt give them negative!

We have an extended warranty on a fridge freezer. Called them a little over a week ago as the freezer was frosting up rapidly. After a short question & answer session it was deemed that the seal was faulty on the door. Engineer visit booked for yesterday. Text recd the day previously advising would be there between 8 & 12 & would call ahead. No call received & engineer arrived 50 mins late with no apology. Fitted the new door seal & left after 10 mins. When my wife came home a couple of hrs later & went into the freezer to get something out, inside of the door was wet. Called them back & was told that it could take up to 5 hrs for the seal to bed down & become effective. By 7.30 still no better so called back again. Despite the problem being through their own poor workmanship, the first date I was offered was next Wednesday for a further engineer visit which I told them was completely unacceptable. When asked how I should claim for the food lost, was told that they don‚Äôt pay out for food & I should claim on my house insurance. Somewhat incensed, I asked them how they thought the insurers would accept this as an insured risk to simply receive the same scripted answer. We have had further conversations with them today, including escalating this into a complaint & asking to speak to a more senior person to be told that their managers ‚Äúweren‚Äôt customer facing‚Äù!

Update, 10th September.
Despite the seemingly positive response posted to my original review, having responded as asked, it transpired that the department at the end of that strand was also infected with the ""computer says no"" approach! Fire up by this point, I then e-mailed the group chief executive, only to find that the ""computer says no"" approach seems to start from that height!

To cut a very long story short, ended up with a total of three engineers visits ( always on a Wednesday - do they all only work Wednesdays?) & finally got to the point where the unit was scrapped since the problem was presumed to be the door since replacing the seal hands fixed it. Our police provided for the replacement cost so, once we have the code text, trogged off to Currys; found a replacement & tried to use the voucher. Teamknowhow couldn't even get that right since the code they sent me was for another customer, different county & for 5 times what we were expecting. Fortunately, after all the examples of dreadful service we'd received, there ws one final shining light, yes, there is someone ( actually three including the delivery guys) who understands what ""providing the customer with a positive experience"" really means. Even Jay was horrified where we told him some of the ties of woes that we'd experienced.

At last, we now have our new fridge/freezer!",0
"I bought a S21Ultra5G and it has some problems with mic ,gps antenna and battery .

Waited a week to get tv back from repair. Took a day of work using my holiday entitlement as team know how can‚Äôt give me a pm slot so after staying in all day and delivery didn‚Äôt turn up or an explanation why as the driver had gone home was tracking order and he went from slot 20 to 22 missing out my 21 delivery spot.

"AVOID IF INTERNET AND LANDLINE ARE NECESSARY
I changed to BT because I thought fibre would be better.
I get at least 3 failures per day and at the weekends it is often off for an hour our more.
They blame it on me, On the computer, on giant eagles crossing over. I have had no Wifi except for about 5 minutes after switching on.
I hav'nt been able to use my laptop or table since last year.
I have paid over ¬£200 for having the computer checked. He can't do it remotely as before because he can't get into my system remotely.
Openreach and BT don't communicate. Twice I have been given an engineer appointment and he has turned up without the necessary components.
I was then texted that ""we shall be changing you over to Digital Recognition your landline will then be as efficient as your Broadband"".
It was like a death knell. I managed to finally get through to someone to say don't touch it. I need the landline its the only bit that works and since I have frequent power cuts my landline is linked to Scottish Power so all I have to do is telephone them and I will get details of the outages and when they will be fixed. I was called a liar - ""telephones don't work it the power is off"". But they promised to keep away from my telephone system.
3 days later I got a text from someone in Newcastle saying I had to have the new system.
On the Friday a friend came rushing up at lunchtime to say he had been phoning since 8.30 and thought I might be in some danger.
The phones were not working. The power was off and the phones.
Then I found out that they had switched over on that day without telling me.
I had no phones for three days and had arguments with them in which they said my telephones wouldn't work on the new system so they would have to provide me with a new hub and new phones.
The engineer arrived to do this (my choice) as I thought that they would have no excuse to call me stupid and incompetent if they fitted them.
They did not work. The following day and for 4 days I could not make calls out and when anyone phoned it switched off after the second ring. Their excuse: it must have been a nuisance call.
Wednesday I got in touch with an 'expert' on the complaints network.
She told me that they had no right to change me over. That they could supply me with battery which would hold a charge for a few hours if the electricity failed and they would send me an engineer on tuesday after the bank holiday.
Today Saturday I received a text saying they had checked the line and it was working!!!!
I have had to have new phone, a Wifi booster, and will have to pay ¬£59 + Vat for a battery. I have not received the battery as promised a week ago.",0
"I was moved house Nov 2021 but unfortunately my house fell through so put my account on hold, BT gave me nothing but problems. Again this year I sold my home and went into temp accommodation whilst my account went on hold. Once again problem after problem with BT, I had 3 accounts open for me, none of my old accounts ever closed, then said they were closed then 1 would be open then all 3 would be open. I cancelled my broadband connection giving 2 weeks notice and followed that up with 3 calls each time saying the appointment was cancelled until yesterday when BT said it was too late to cancel so you wasted an OpenReach engineers time, a wasted appointment when it's a month to get connected at the moment, you left me to tell the engineer as you couldn't be bothered. BT owe me money because they decided to keep taking my direct debit each month and told me not to close it otherwise I wouldn't get a refund. Never again will BT provide my broadband, they've treated me very poorly and treat their contractors equally as badly.

Response to David, I know on hold isn't your 'BT technical' word but it's when you leave one house and don't move immediately to another so you stop the service and don't take the d/d except this time you continued to take money. I have emailed the CEO and your complaints team, spoke to complaints team today who understood exactly what I meant when I said I was put on hold, you're being awkward just like several other BT staff I've spoken too, luckily a couple have understood what I mean!",0
"I've handed over my laptop to your team over three weeks ago to get it fixed and the data restored, paid ¬£150 and was assured it'll take a maximum of two weeks. At first I got an assured return date after a week, which wasn't met after which I didn't get any updates whatsoever. Now, after three weeks I receive a text message saying that I need to ring your team, which I do about 15 times until I finally get through to someone. That person was beyond rude, it took me ages to explain my issue to them because they didn't have the information at hand even though I provided my reference number, had to convince them that I paid for getting it fixed as well as the recovery only to be told that it wasn't possible and I would have to pay an additional ¬£350 if I wanted my data to be restored now. This is beyond ridiculous I could buy a new laptop for that price.
Furthermore I was then told that they'd pass it 'onto the engineers who would have a look at it ""at some point""' and after asking how long that would take only got a 'well I don't know that either'.

For the price I paid this is absolutely abysmal customer service, my laptop has clearly just been laying around for three weeks just for this to happen. I am shocked about this and expect that the least you can do is give me back my money for this.",0

"Awful, awful, truly extremely poor service.

Bought an item from Curry's which I needed to return due to a website malfunction. Their website directs you to a broken chatbox, which, no matter what path you take through it, leaves you with a message that live chat is unavailable. Phoning them up gets you an automated set of menus that, in the end, tells you to go and use the chatbox anyway. They have a 'returns' form that I filled in which resulted in an automated email... telling me I needed to use the chatbox (yes, the broken, useless chatbox) and, in the end, I tried to use Twitter to get in touch with these guys. Got a response telling me to send a direct Twitter message that was ignored for a week (literally not even seen) and, in the end, I was forced to send numerous tweets at them before anything got done.

Dreadful. Absolutely dreadful. Whilst this company still manages their customer service, do yourselves a favour and never buy from Currys PC World.",0
"Dreadful company creating issues that don't exist. Daughter quoted ¬£230, sent phone off only for them to come back to say they will offer her ¬£75 as they found a fault with the proximity simulator. If you check Amazon you can buy one of these for ¬£8. Disgusting.

In reply the order number is: M8390123. However unless you are going to pay a fair price and not a ¬£155 loss then there is no room for a conversation.",0

"So you want to get after-sales support about your web order? Here are your options: (1) Have a pointless web chat with a ""computer says no"" chatbot. (2) Go down to a high street store, be moved through a bunch of unhelpful staff culminating in the store manager telling you to go away because web orders aren't his problem. (3) Send an email - you'll notice that Currys don't have any email addresses publicly available - the store manager relented and gave me one and I found another one from Resolver - so far all my emails have gone unanswered for 10+ days. (4) Call them - today that resulted in a 2 hour (!) wait to speak to anyone, and then an unhelpful chat with someone who wouldn't resolve the issue and wouldn't put me through to a manager. I've been promised a callback but I'm still waiting (hopes aren't high, I suspect I'll need to join the 2h queue again).

And the icing on the cake is that I need support because of their mistake! Never before have I experienced such appalling service.

"Traded my iphone 6s for a brand new iphone 12, valued at 50¬£.
My phone was in excellent condition just a few scratch marks on the bottom corners (as shown by an apple inspection from last year)
Other than that, it worked perfectly.
One week later I received an email saying that due to screen burn my phone was deemed not working and wanted to pay me 10¬£.
Of course I told them that‚Äôs impossible, the screen was in perfect condition, no scratches, no cracks and definitely not screen burn damage. Again they insisted and said that ‚ÄúI probably missed it‚Äù. Of course I asked to have my phone back because they were talking rubbish. And after a few weeks I received my phone only to find they have completely ruined it. It has multiple scratch marks on the sides of the phone, a dent on the back top right hand side, the silent button went from being orange to completely black and wait for it....the screen has been damaged and has multiple white dots which I personally think are damaged pixels caused by physical damage and NOT screen burn.
Sent them two emails over the course of 3 weeks demanding an explanation and they have completely ignored me.
AVOID AT ALL COSTS

FOR THE 100TH TIME, my iphone 6s did not have any screen burns/ ghosting PRIOR to sending it to you(NOW upon receiving it back, there are clear white dots as soon as I switch it on)

"On 23/11/22, I signed up online for full fibre broadband. I received a batch of emails confirming the order and confirming that the engineer would visit on 6/1/23 to complete the installation. Vodaphone let my existing provider know of the switchover and they confirmed cancellation of my existing service with effect from 6/1/23.

On 4/1/23, I tried to use the temporary password from Vodaphone to log into my new account and kept getting an error message to say that this account was cancelled. I then realised they hadn't sent me any equipment and I'd had no emails from delivery companies telling me a package from Vodaphone was on the way so realised something major was wrong. A scan through my emails showed that I had had no further communication from Vodaphone since those confirming my order and the installation appointment.

This morning (5/1) I went into the local shop and the guy confirmed that the order was cancelled and gave me a number to call. They said, from experience, it would take at least 10 days to sort out and I could have a dongle in the meantime to provide 4G.

Joe, in Customer Service, was excellent but was very limited in what he could do personally. He contacted someone on the technical side who said it would take 2-3 weeks to rebuild the order AND the price of that package had now gone up so I would have to pay the new price(!!!!!) Joe's manager authorised him to rebuild the order at the original price and he apologised for the poor service, saying it was not what Vodaphone customers should expect. He was exemplary!

I run a business from home so I absolutely cannot have a break in my broadband service. A break of 10 days to 3 weeks will cost me a lot of money! The hours spent working on this today have lost me money as I should be working.

The result is that I now have a choice: try to get my existing provider to cancel the switch-off (but what are the chances of that going right at this late stage?) or accepting a dongle, having 4G wifi for 10 days to 3 weeks, and then continuing to do business with a company which has treated me appallingly and left me in an awful position.

I'll have to think that through but in the meantime I can be absolutely clear that if I had known this was going to happen, I would NEVER have signed up for Vodaphone and would advise anyone else to be VERY careful before they think about doing so.

UPDATE: I went to the local Vodafone shop to rebuild the order and they said they couldn't offer it at the price I had signed up for and the manager couldn't authorise a discount. I came home again and called the complaints department. They authorised the discount (the contract I had with Vodafone!) and set up the new account BUT they have set it up at a higher price AND they can't get the engineer to do the installation until 30/1 at the earliest (25 days). I'm away then so the earliest date we can do is 7/2, a month and a day after it was due. So what do I do about internet in the meantime? Seems I have to have a 4G dongle. And I thought I was getting full fibre broadband on 6/1!!! What kind of company is this????

RE THE REPLY BELOW: I gave you more than enough chances to put this right and after spending 4 hours on a day when I should have been working trying to sort it out, the decision was made that I won't ever do business with Vodafone again.",0

"First time to ever have to do this but so upset over our experience. Would give zero stars if possible.
We have sent our brand new laptop for repair 3 times and pcspecialists are now refusing to offer a repacement or refund and claiming it's fine even though their own IT support remoted on and confirmed the fault. Laptop overheating, hot to the touch, blue screening. CPU running at over 100' which they're claiming now is perfectly normal. Really poor after sales customer care. 9 year old saved up for 2 years to get his 1st gaming laptop and really upset over this whole experience. Shame on you pcspecialists. Been back and forward on this since March üòû

In response to your reply below. There was further fault found the day it returned from the second repair. We spent a further hour on to your help desk where several support agents remoted on trying an hour of troubleshooting and all confirmed that 100 degrees plus is not normal operating CPU temperatures, these temps would cause damage to other parts over time and blue screens and hot keyboards and roaring fans due to these temps (playing simple games like terraria, astroneer and Roblox) are not satisfactory user conditions.
We are now being told by the refunds team that these temps are fine and we are not entitled to a refund.
We have zero confidence in this device and most decent companies at this stage of a customers bad experience with their device would offer a goodwill gesture. Let alone the fact that most of your staff agreed with us that this machine still is faulty after a 3rd RMA. Absolutely awful customer service.

Latest update. PC specialist finally agreed to a refund in the form of a credit note that must be used within a week and are now deducting 100euros for slight scratches to the PSU and case. They have said they can't sell on with these scratches. This is a faulty 2nd hand laptop and by no means should be sold on to a new consumer as new anyway. If they recondition this laptop and sell on as a reconditioned laptop then these slight scratches would be expected.",0
"From the onset of purchasing a Sharp TV from Currys branch at Effra Road on 17/06/19, I have intermittently experienced problems with the device. This has ranged from the tv suddenly shutting down and restarting, the picture and remote freezing, being thrown out of applications, etc.
> This was very irritating; particularly as it caused me to miss parts of programme due to the wait involved while it initialized.
> I first contactind the repair line Teamknowhow (TKH) in August 2019, and a number of times thereafter, and on each occasion was advised to reset the TV. I did this on a number of occasions subsequently but finally lost patience and contacted TKH again on 22/10/19 and following discussion they agreed to accept the TV for repair. The TV was collected from my home address on 23/10/19 at which point I was advised it would be returned on 28/10/19. On 25/10/19 I received a text message informing me that ""my item had safely arrived at the repair center"". On 27/10/18 I received a further text message informing me that my TV's delivery would take place between 07:55 and 11:55 on the aforementioned date I had to take the day off work to accommodate them. At approximately 11.40 on 28/10/19 a delivery driver arrived and after informing me he had my TV proceeded to seach the vehicle only to then inform me he could not find it. I waited as he spoke to the warehouse and then informed me it had not been loaded onto the van and that I would be contacted by TKH regarding the issue later that day. The phone call did not come. I contacted TKH the same day and was informed it had missed the van because they found another issue with the television the day before it was meant to be delivered. Subsequently received a message (without negotiation) informing me that the delivery was arranged for 31/10/19. Unfortunately, the delivery date coincided with the resurfacing of my road and despite the TV being quite light, the delivery driver abandoned the delivery without even attempting to contact me. I would have been more that willing to meet him with my ID to collect my TV; given I had taken a further day off work to accommodate the delivery. Through pure exasperation I contacted TKH to demand a refund. The staff member agreed to my request, said she was unable to send me a confirmation email but instructed me to return to Currys with my receipt as she had put the information on their system. My visit to Currys was futile and after 2 hours with customers service, during which the sales assistant spoke to his manager and TKH but informed me the refund could not be made as they had to physically received the TV before doing so. In my presence he arranged the delivery of the TV back to Currys (Effra Road) for 01/11/19 as I have been unable to take further time off work. I was advised to return to Currys on the aforementioned date and assured the problem would be rectified then. I returned to the store on that date only to be told the TV had not been delivered to them. I am extremely angry about the treatment received from TKH from the onset and by Currys apparent inability to rectify the situation. I have since returned to Currys on 3 separate occasions to experience the same process of them delivering the tv back to the store. In addition I have spoken with different TKH staff members (as a manager is never available) but the issue has yet to be resolved. The last straw was their complaints department emailing me today instructing me to return to the store to sort it out despite the fact that they (TKH) have the TV and I have yet to be reimbursed.
I will never purchase a product from Currys as long as live and will advise anyone I know of the same. Disgraceful customer treatment by both!",0
"Having to give another 1 star review as Mazuma have flagged my previous review because they don't believe its genuine, this is no doubt how the company keeps such a high rating. I have had my previously mint condition samsung s20 returned today, I previously sent it off and was given a price decrease as mazuma claimed my phone has serious screen burn and a crack on the back glass, having turned on the device there was no screen burn at all however I was devastated to notice there was a new crack on the back of the phone. Now I sent this in perfect condition and this crack has very obviously been done at the warehouse after if was received. It wasn't on any of the corners of the phone which it would have been had this occured in the post. It was clearly dropped on the corner of a table or something similar due to the placement of the damage. Futher proof that my phone has recently been damaged is that the glass is still loose from the crack and there are still shards falling off, had the crack already been there it would have smoothed off at this point. My phone was always kept in a heavy duty case with a screen protector and I know this wasn't my fault. Absolutely terrible company won't be using them again! Now having to pay to have my phone repaired so I can sell it to an actual reputable company. Thank you Mazuma.",0
Bt has ripped us off for years with poor unreliable networks. Recently I tried to cancel and have been held for ridiculous times on the phone. However as a way of compensation I was promised our wifi to be switched back on. And now have received a bill for it for ¬£105 and it‚Äôs been on less than a week. And the only reason it is on is because BT is incapable/incompetent to cancel our useless package!,0
"Very bad company. Am writing while still waiting to book a simple repair. this call shows 51 minutes. waited 30 minutes to get hold of someone. This is not the worst, I've called on Friday and got no response. Today I called earlier and after 30 minutes I had an answer, but then was cut off. in the first they were going to book it but I got cut off. in the second call they asked me for reference number. I said I don't have it but I already had a repair so you should know. They kept asking me for it, I insisted they should have it. Then they say ""I'll give you benefit of doubt"". Oh my God. After finding my reference number they have now passed me on to someone else who I am supposed to give this reference number to. I'm taking names, but due to GDPR rules I might run into problems so won't mention names

time now 60 minutes....
Afetr 114 minutes they said they will call me back after 24 to 72 hours

bye",0
"I am shocked, long story short I've sold them an Iphone 13 pro max in a pristine condition, however today they've come back to me with a repriced offer reducing the original quote by ¬£150 due to some scratches on my phone. I had no scratches on my phone whatsoever, the minute that I received my phone, I put it in a case and as well as I put the screen protector on it too. On top of that it took them nearly 2 weeks to send me a sales pack, it's a joke, do not use them.",0

"I placed an order worth ¬£300. The first time I wasn't in but asked them to leave it with a neighbor but it got taken back. They said they would come back to deliver it in the evening and they never contacted me through text or call and I never got my order.

Once contacted they said they'd delivered it when they hadnt. They then investigated the order and said they'd try deliver it again.

Today they said they would deliver it between 7am and 1pm but I wasn't contacted at any point and this was the 3rd attempt. I'd been in all day and they gave a phone call saying they'd tried at 9am. This lead to a 4th attempt and they said they'd have it to me this afternoon but I haven't been contacted once again and I still don't have my order. It's 6pm well past the afternoon.

It's been 4 attempts and 3 of the attempts they haven't contacted me to say they was here with my delivery.

Don't order from here as they can't even seem to contact you when they've arrived with the order or deliver it.",0

"I am afraid to say it was a terrible shopping experience.
We ordered an iPhone XS but kept being canceled by CPW saying ""it did not pass our internal security checks."" It was ironic when we (cardholder) called the CS to find out what is going wrong but was told a different story ""It was because your credit card blocked the transaction; we actually want to sell you the phone"". We actually have particularly called our credit card CS and released any transaction with CPW, so it wasn't the case. We kept trying for nearly ten orders which all ended in vain. Funnily the ""iPhone X Essential Bundle"" we ordered alongside the phone itself has been successful and delievered to us. Wondering what we do with the bundle without a phone!",0
Poor service all the way through. Needed to finish contract a few months early and got billed almost ¬£150 for doing so. Will never use again,0
They don‚Äôt even deserve one star I went to order a I phone 11 and it went all well at least that‚Äôs what I thought I got told it was dispatched and on it‚Äôs way they gave me a time slot between 12-4 so I was indoors most of the day to only not have my phone arrive but to not even be told it got sent back to the warehouse because apparently it was fraud which it wasn‚Äôt and had confirmations about this from my bank and authorities. I had to call up asking we‚Äôre my phone was to be told it was not coming. Now at this point I was not happy with everything about this I felt like this was really strange and felt like it was a scam. I had paid ¬£50 upfront cost that came out of my bank the same day as I purchased the I phone which is now over a week ago. I was told I would get my refund when I called up asking about my phone and why it didn‚Äôt arrive. However long be hold 5 days went past and no refund I called them up on the 6th day and to only be told the person who said the refund would be in my account didn‚Äôt actually process my refund I asked to speak to the manager and they refused to talk to me !!! I didn‚Äôt swear or be rude on the phone as I no everyone is under a lot of stress at the moment but this just did it for me I was so angry and hurt I then spoke to my bank about this and they said I can report it as fraud so I called them back up asking for my money to be back in my account within the next 2-3 days or I‚Äôm reporting it as fraud and taking this further and the person on the phone was very rude and kept questioning my address and my phone number and name even tho I passed security questions I felt like I was on a call with a scammer and immediately left the call after he said he has processed my refund. I highly don‚Äôt recommend this company they made me feel very uncomfortable on the phone and unsafe. Let‚Äôs hope I get my refund or I will be taken this matter with the authorities and my bank as fraud!!!,0
"Firstly, happy with the TV aspect which is contract free and via dongle. NOT HAPPY with Broadband/phone service - lost telephone number due to being 'cancelled out'. Number belonged to 84 year old dad who has had the number for roughly 40 years and all those who need to know it, know it. Not been able to retrieve it and the customer service experience is dire. So both dad and I have taken our business to BT (who I might add desperately tried to retrieve dad's number but coulnd't be done).",0

"Awful service. The delivery rider wandered around in the freezing cold for 5-10 minutes with my order out of his thermal bag, and so I refused to accept the order when he finally got to my door. The rider said he would arrange a re-delivery of a hot order but didn't and when I spoke to Deliveroo they refused to redeliver or refund and so I have had to start a charge-back via my bank (as in the UK we are entitled to a full refund under the Consumer Rights Act). I will never use this company again, and I recommend nobody else does.",0
"Having raised a complaint with LG back in mid December about a faulty washing machine bought via Currys, after many weeks of wrangling they decided to refund the cost of the machine via Currys. Two weeks later and having called Team Knowhow (Currys Customer Service) maybe 6-7 times for an update, we are still being fobbed off with excuses. Currys have both my faulty machine and the monies due to me. Great company if nothing goes wrong, shockingly bad customer service if things go awry. Don't buy from Currys!",0
Where do I start with this service I‚Äôve had it installed last Monday since that day I‚Äôve spoken to 5 talktalk customer service advisors who always pass me on to another person and ends up cutting the chat off and spoke to two on the phone about my internet no one seems to have a clue what‚Äôs going on and no one seems to care whether your broadband is working. This has majorly affected my working life as it‚Äôs essential working from home more to the point we‚Äôve not been able to watch any sort of tv or just general surf the Internet as we haven‚Äôt got any I‚Äôve had to buy extension packs on my phone package just so the kids can watch tv who haven‚Äôt been able to do their homework unless it‚Äôs at a family members house. I cannot comment on the service as of yet not recieved any but the customer service team is absolutely no help whatsoever. Talktalk really need to sort this issue out because it‚Äôs not only affecting my working life (losing time at work unless I‚Äôm in coffee shops) but also my leisure time my kids lives school and after school and also costing me money all because no one can be asked to actually do their job. Absolute shambolic service.,0
Had the worse experience with this company. I ordered a Ninja that I paid for up front that was never delivered. After 2 calls each taking over 40 mins to get through I was finally refunded my money but less the delivery charge! Not sure how that works paying for something that I never had delivered .,0
My laptop was written off by team knowhow in mid October. I was told that I would then receive a voucher which hasn't turned up. Team knowhow have told me over the phone twice now that I would receive the voucher by the end of the following week. I also visited my local pc world who phoned knowhow who then told pc world that I was at the top of the list. Up there with the worst customer service I've experienced.,0

"The Scarborough branch (Seamer Road, Scarborough), what can I say.

I returned an item around early December 2022 after the item was defective. This amounted to ¬£325 worth of product that was not working. The staff member that handled it outright refused to refund the item, and would only offer me a gift card. No ifs, no buts, despite telling him what your own website says and what your phone support said.

I went back to the store on the 28th day to return a faulty item. This is within Curry's return policy for faulty item(s), which is blatantly written on your website, and was also told the same by Customer Services over the phone.

This incredibly rude and senior staff member told me I wasn't allowed to refund the item because I only had 14 days. Even when I told him this is false as it is faulty, mentioned the Consumers Act 2015 to reject the goods under law, and that CS told me I was entitled to a refund, he told me they were wrong, and I was two weeks outside the return policy -- explicitly for faulty items -- not an ""unwanted"" item, and said I could only exchange the item for a gift card.

Frustrated and made to feel a muppet in front of customers and staff, I accepted this gift card exchange. I then left, and called Customer Services straight away. The CS rep was incredibly helpful, and even tried to contact the Scarborough store to tell them they were, in fact, wrong (plus tell them that they failed to factor in the extended returns policy for both faulty AND unwanted items.)

The rep couldn't get through to the store, but assured me I *should* return to the store and demand a refund.

I returned roughly an hour later, and conveniently, the senior staff member who outright refused to refund me had ""gone home"", but had the polar opposite experience with another senior staff member, in which he couldn't fathom why the other staff member failed to refund me, and why he loaded a gift card with two different amounts (which confused the staff member when trying to refund me for the ¬£325 gift card as the first staff member failed to give me a receipt -- conveniently -- for the refund AND gift card exchange.) What amazed me more, was when he went (verbatim, as I recorded the verbal conversation) ""I can't understand why he didn't refund you, because even if it wasn't faulty, you were still entitled to a refund under the extended Christmas returns policy we run every single year.""

After spending tens of thousands of pounds with Curry's over recent years, and despite the opposite experience I had when I returned to get a refund (which, can you blame them at that point when he even knew how deceitful the first SM was), I will never shop with you again. I have since moved my business account (which accounted for 80% of my business spending in electronics and technology) to a new supplier, and will be requesting Curry's remove my business account and personal details.

That is a statement to how appalling my local branch treated me, which, by the way, cost me hours in travelling and personal time to sort the problem. I will now no longer make any purchases via both online and brick and mortar stores for personal purchases, ending my loyalty to Curry's entirely.

Unfortunately, as you can't contact local branches anymore for CS, I never got an honest answer as to why that particular staff member was hellbent on lying. He knew the policy, he's been in that store almost every time I've been in over the last several months -- he knew what he was doing. He didn't want to be responsible for taking a return of ¬£325, and instead, literally lied and conned me into believing I was wrong and your own CS was wrong. Manipulative, but frankly, embarrassing, as they have ultimately cost Curry's a loyal and frequent customer.",0
"Used your website regarding a missing item that said it had been delivered by the diabolical Evri. The proof of delivery has a photo of a front door that isn't mine(and is closed, so much for a safe place) and a GPS location of a street that isn't even in my town. Tried to contact Evri with zero response(shocker). Contacted yourselves after logging in to my account and filled in all the relevant details and I get an email saying please reply with your name, address and dob as I can't be verified.

After all these years, they STILL can't manage to deal with updating credit card details for automatic payment. Website - when you get through the Official Secrets Act required to log on - is awful.

"My wife aged 77, a former optician has been with BT since 1981. She is disabled, in poor health, and receives Pension Credit, this qualifies her for the Basic Broadband package costing ¬£18.00 per month, they claim the price should be ¬£24.99 pm. We ordered the Basic Package and now have it installed a saving of ¬£7.00 per month. After the installation occurred B.T informed us they do not believe she is on Pension Credit so will not give her/us the agreed discounted price. So far three conversations have been held with BT about this but there is no way we can convince them they are in the wrong, to do so we obtained a letter from the Pension Service proving her entitlement claims but BT do not have a Department that can handle disputes or prove claims; if they say you are not on Pension Credit then you're not on Pension Credit. And if you do not pay their incorrect bills, they will cut you off. If a BT monitor sees this post will they tell us who to send the Pension's Service letter to, because your staff does not appear to know?

"Horrendous company

Purchased a new phone from them on a Vodafone 2 year 5G contract. I was told that I could simply get a PAC code to keep my existing Vodafone number, there is even a box on the order form that requests ""If you have an existing Vodafone number, please enter it here"", but this is simply NOT true. Customer support were useless, telling me I'd failed the security check but refusing to tell me why or to ask a 2nd security question. As I'd set the account up with them 5 minutes earlier I fail to understand how my email address which is what they requested for security could fail their checks!!! Rang back and queued for a further 20 minutes to be asked for the password, again it failed security even though I could use it to login to the account I'd just created. In short, they just didn't want to know. I was then told that in any case I would need to speak to Vodafone about the issue. I called Vodafone, queud again, and spoke to someone to explain the issue. It was interesting that their very first comment was ""It wasn't from Carphone Warehouse was it?"" Very telling. They then explained that they get a constrant stream of calls from unhappy CPW customers because the information CPW provide is simply false. I had to move my existing number to Pay As You Go and now have to wait 30 days, during which I will be paying for the new contract AND the OLD and all the calls/texts and Data on the PAYG contract I've been forced to take. After 30 days, I can then request a PAC code to move the number so I can keep using it. CPW looked cheap but I made a very expensive mistake in using them. I have written a complaint to OFCOM about the company, and have written to CPW to request a 1 month credit during which period I cannot use the new contract,and also compensation for the costs that will be incurred by moving to PAYG for a month. I don't expect a reply so suspect it will end up in the small claims court. If I'd have ordered from Vodafone direct, I would have non of this hasstle so the additional ¬£4/month now looks somewhat ad-minimis. In summary, DO NOT USE Carphone Warehouse under any circumstances, you will regret it.",0

"We ordered a boo burger recently it cost 23.23 . We waited nothing turned up , we had one missed call and rang it straight back, it was a number you couldn‚Äôt make reply calls to. We called boo burger to ask for advice they were unable to help. We opened a complaint on revolver. We received information first to say they left the food outside. We checked there was nothing, we went to our neighbours, nothing. We carried on our complaint. Each day same message, we are looking into it.
Each time my daughter verified her email and phone number, twice we received a message to say we hadn‚Äôt responded (we had).
Then they changed their story to say they had evidence of the driver waiting 9 minutes at our door, banging on our door. Complete rubbish we sat in the room right by our front door with our dog who goes mad when anyone knocks, nothing. What happened to the part of the story of them leaving the burgers, that suddenly changed. To cut a very long story short I am 23.23 out of pocket and left hungry. My husband then drove to Leicester and we had a burger from five guys. One we could actually eat.

"Phone and internet has failed 5 times in 2 months and it's gone down again.

NowTV requires me to be at home to log a fault..... how, when the line is down? I've gone to my daughter's house. There are no options on the website to register a line fault, they are all broadband faults. The chat function is to a computer only. There is no phone number to call (I had to contact someone in Sky - Sky owns NowTV). Hasn't anyone in NowTV ever thought what the reasons are a customer might call and tried out the service from a customer's perspective? Obviously not! No fault has been logged until today despite the line being down for 3 days. Openreach is about to go on strike for two days and the lead time for an engineer is 4 days.

I doubt that this happened in transit. I strongly urge anyone thinking of dealing with this company not to do so, they are an unprofessional to deal with.

Envirofone tried their best to have my 1-star review removed but Trustpilot have verified it. I just wish I could give 0-stars for this company. Research shows that they consistently offer a fair price for phones, only for them to revise the price down significantly for apparent ‚Äòfaults‚Äô.

"I applied online to move from Sky Broadband & Phone (following the March 2021 price hike) to Now. All went through and got a confirmation e-mail at 12:48. Charge was processed and debited from my bank two days later. The e-mail asked me to verify the account, which I did and an hour later my account changed from 'processing' to 'cancelled'. There has never been any issue with payments to my Sky account, so I phoned Now who apologised and reinstated the order and I got a second 'welcome' e-mail at 14:28. Checking this later I saw that this too had changed to 'cancelled'. Phoning again I was informed that the problem was transferring the telephone number to Now. But again it was deemed sorted, and I got a third 'welcome' e-mail at 19:46.

On the day of the expected transfer I had not received the new Now Hub, the cost of which had been debited from my account two weeks earlier. So I phoned Now again to find out that the transfer had gone nowhere and they still could not retain the previous telephone number - which naturally is important.

Given that Sky and Now are ultimately the same company this is unacceptable.

Sky say there is absolutely nothing wrong at their end. Now say that Sky are blocking the transfer. One of them is lying.

I am sick to death of both.

Update 8 April:- I have been informed (by the fifth person I have had to call at NOW, but at least she returned the call at the time she said she would) after pushing hard, that there is a ""known issue"" at Now when transferring a number from Sky. Given that they are ultimately the same company this should not happen. They are due to contact me again next week to ""update me on whether my number can be kept"" - OFCOM regulations state that ""Phone providers must allow to take your telephone number with you"" and that ""Phone providers must offer compensation if they block or delay you from porting your number when switching""

Will update next week ....... tbc

Update 14 April:- Checked today and on my account all services are once again 'cancelled'. No-one has been in touch to explain, I have had no communication at all from this shambolic company. Have now raised a complaint with OFCOM.

There is a phrase involving brewery / cannot / arrange. Trust me, NOW fulfil the requirements!",0
"I had read the warnings but foolishly thought that as we previously were connected via SKY and 'NOW' is part of Sky there would be no issues. I signed up on the 17th of March, paid the fee for the router delivery and was informed that the go-live date was 31st March. I thought nothing more of it until today 28th March when I received an email from SKY confirming the cancellation of my services with them and asking if I had arranged another provider as they were yet to hear from anyone! I then logged into my 'NOW' account and discovered that, without any notification at all, they had cancelled my account! There was no explanation as to why they had done this. I contacted them via Twitter and they asked me to phone customer support. I NEVER discuss accounts over the phone because I want everything in writing. Too many times in the past I have agreed to something on the phone only to be told later that the company has no record of it. So I do things via email or social media. Any company that insists I speak to them on the phone is not getting my business. Luckily I signed up to 'NOW' with my PayPal debit card so I was able to cancel that payment process...just in case NOW ""forgot"" they cancelled my service and tried to take the money. Some may be lucky and get great service with NOW broadband but I will never trust them again.",0

"TLDR: Don't even think of spending any money with Carphone Warehouse. The way an organisation treats you when something goes wrong tells you all you need to know.

Absolutely shocking response when I asked for a refund for a faulty Nokia 1+ 2019 mobile phone. They said it's not their policy to refund and that you can only have an exchange. Then they said you can only have an exchange if you bring back the original box. Then when I explained that they can't refuse a refund according to my statutory rights, they claimed that they had offered me a refund and that I had refused it. I asked them to prove that statement by giving me a copy of the CCTV but they've ignored that request. Just a little longer and I will be contacting the ICO about that part.

The service from this organisation is so awfully bad it's been almost entertaining. I've been lied to, ignored, and fobbed off, told to jump through totally unnecessary hoops (write to this address instead of us! Go back to the shop instead of writing to us!), thay've sat on things for weeks on end and have refused to take responsibility for resolution. Maybe they're hoping I will go away if they delay and frustrate me enough but it's actually spurred me on. I am applying to the Courts to get my money back, having written twice to the customer service director without receiving the courtesy of even an acknowledgement. Whilst that won't stop other people from making the mistake of buying from these people it will at least make me feel that I did my small part to push back against a terminally stupid corporate machine that's totally lost sight of its statutory responsibilities. But please don't buy from them. Please.

EDIT: Since writing this review and receiving the hackneyed ""ooh, we're utterly shocked that you had a bad experience, please email us"" response below, one of my two letters to the Carphone Warehouse head office address at PO Box 375, Southampton, SO30 2PU has been returned marked ""gone away"". This was the address given to me by their so-called customer service team. It just adds to the epic saga of utter feckless incompetence. If there were awards for being the opposite of ethical, customer focused etc this is the hands down winner. Avoid.",0
"40 minutes on hold to be given a shocking service. All I wanted to do was to close my account. The second time I‚Äôve tried and still nothing.

"Absolutely disgraceful customer service. They have only been helpful with starting my business broadbands.

"I have been a BT customer for many years, the whole lot - landline, broadband, BT sport and mobile. I'm not surprised they've got an average score here of 1.5.... Although generally ok, wifi levels etc, if there's a problem they are hopeless. About 2 years ago BT moved away from Yahoo for email service which resulted in losing emails to my phone, failing to sync contacts on my phone and then losing most contacts on my phone, which then somehow synced to my Mac and same. When I called to try to resolve, they just said tough, they didn't offer any technical support for email problems. The inconvenience and hours I have spent trying to replace contacts I hate to think. A random apple geek helped find a pathway to restore emails to phone but not contacts. I complained and not heard anything. More recently I had a complete loss of service, took 5 days to get an engineer out and turned out to be due to cabling fault in road, huge inconvenience and no apology, no compensation. I complained and again, it's just a bore for them, noted over the phone and no follow up response. I can't think of any other type of service when if someone was paying @ ¬£1,500 a year they wouldn't expect much more. And because of BT email address on everything it's impossible to move. The regulator should have more teeth to call them to account.
(Edit) Following response from BT suggesting I reach out to their customer feedback site, I have posted on 'BT community' and after about 2 weeks there is no reply. As suggested above, why don't BT offer proper support for the services they provide, especially when making significant service changes such as changing their email platform (ffs), it's pathetic, I know it just sounds like whingeing but the time and grief this has caused, its criminal there's no comeback.",0

"During road works, workmen for another company have damaged our Virgin cable.

On ringing Virgin, apparently it will take a week before they can send an engineer out to mend the cable. It is sub-contracted, and there is no way they can escalate the timescale.

A week with no phone, no internet and absolutely no sense of urgency to help.

Avoid.

UPDATE: The response Virgin have posted below absolutely illustrates my point. A load of words, but absolutely no attempt to resolve their poor service. They acknowledge they have fallen below expected standards, but they won't do anything about it. I have been through the call centre, logged and complaint and done everything I can. They just say sorry and continue to provide a shocking service. AVOID",0

"The worst experience I had had from a supposedly customer orientated company called Curry‚Äôs. Ordered and paid for a Bosch washing machine - paid extra for fitting the new and recycling the old machine. Delivered after phone call to say they were coming in 10 mins. Came, brought in machine, took out old and loaded it into the van. Asked me for a signature& did not believe me when I said they were commissioned to fit it and remove packaging. They said no, showed them receipt and told me they had no tools. I was told to ring the warehouse, I said I did not know them there, next they claimed they had no phone so I asked how they had rung me re the time of delivery - maybe through osmosis. One man disappeared, I refused to sign anything his ‚Äòmate‚Äô whose English was very poor ran out jumped in the van and they drove away. I spent 5hours trying to speak to a manager /director of Curry‚Äôs Knowhow - or should it be called DO NOT Knowhow.
No one could help. Bosses are not available to speak to customers! I was passed from pillar to post I was livid eventually after I told them that I was reporting the theft of my old machine to the police 2 managers rang back at the same time. They offered ¬£20 compensation but upped that after I refused. I have now ordered an FOI for copies of all the calls as they tell you that calls are monitored so the evidence is all there and I certainly was not whimpering as they expect customers to do. The lies, the lack of customer care, the lack of respect for people, the lack of capability of those workers is frightening. I would never recommend this company even to my worst enemy. All one does is pay for a service and all one asks is that It is done with out having to launch world war 3 in order to get what was paid for. I am still very, very angry. Dame Anna Hassan",0

Where to begin with this lot?! Myself and my wife had purchased a washing machine from Curry‚Äôs and opted for the installation service. To cut a long story short our new cushion floor was ripped right through and the fitters/drivers hadn‚Äôt even properly connected up my new machine as during the first cycle we had water pouring out from underneath which drenched our floor and floorboards underneath. We contacted knowhow about this to get our floor repaired and they have rejected our claim twice now because the drivers said they didn‚Äôt do it. The only reason why I noticed the ripped flooring was because they purposely left the machine sticking out so that it covered the damage and by the time I had noticed and moved the machine back into its normal position they were long gone. Bunch of cowboys. Well I‚Äôve told them I ain‚Äôt dropping it and I‚Äôm going to court and trading standards. We‚Äôve had nothing but stress over this and it was supposed to be a stress free service. The drivers lack integrity and it‚Äôs appears that this lack in quality filters down from the top.,0
"Carphone warehouse has been successful in providing the worst consumer experience of my life. Returns policy is still 14 days after delivery (despite covid), but it is next to impossible to contact CPW to get a returns process started. It took hours to contact someone on Web chat and even then around half of the time, their systems were down so they couldn't even help me. After I returned the phone (at my own cost because carphone warehouse refused to pay for it) carphone warehouse acknowledged they had received it and would process the refund within 2 weeks. For comparison I sent a phone to Meelie and had the money in my account the next day. Anyways at the 2 week mark, guess what - the incompetent Carphone Warehouse had not sent me my money! Once again I had to try and get through on webchat (ie spend hours and multiple tries to try and get through). When I eventually managed to get through I was told my refund had been cancelled for no apparent reason! They then reinitiated the refund process and I've finally got my money back. What I will never be able to get back is hours of my life and sanity that this company has wasted. All in all it took 1 month from starting the returns process to getting my money back.",0

"Was actually a happy customer for over two years, but now everything changed. At first Three and others were promising no EU Internet roaming charges. All started changing very slowly, so when I first time heard about three starting to charge roaming I tried to leave but online support told me, that as long as I have an old rolling contract I will continue to have free roaming. I was happy about that. Yesterday I received an email from Three basically telling me that I have to take a new contract or I will be put on a new rolling contract as they have no legal obligation to honour my current one. All new contracts are charging for roaming. Contacted online support, explained that free roaming is vital for me and was only offered more data, 30GB for ¬£8 is a good offer but I don't use as much. I don't want to look and pay for EU sim card every time I'm going abroad as I was suggested to do. Also, when I say that roaming is vital for me I do not appreciate being repeatedly told that I can always buy an EU sim card.

Advisor tells me nothing can be done and they cannot offer an interim fix as I am not on that type of contract. What does that even mean. I cancelled my mobile phones last year due to overpayment. BT customer service are rude and unhelpful. I will be cancelling my account when the contract expires.,0
"When the internet works, it works flawlessly, but I have never received worse customer service from a company. Every issue takes between 5 and 15 phone calls to resolve, and will be blamed solely on you even if it's a problem on their end.

When this review was posted, I had already reached out on social media, which had done less than nothing. If you are with future fibre, none of the social media teams can even access your account.

As soon as I can get out of my contract, I will.

AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE",0
Terrible service waited nearly a hole month for a refund and still haven‚Äôt been paid back for our item and have had 2 orders confirmed then cancelled last minute due to stock problems once sorted and refunded won‚Äôt be using again definitely avoid,0
"Full fibre not working. Fault in network. Minimum 5 day fix, but no guarantees. Customer service unhelpful and dismissive. No phone or broadband but paying a premium price for nothing. Absolutely awful",0
"As a pensioner of 80 years of age I was interested in a BT advert that said pensioers could get a cheaper broadband package As I wasn't bothered about speed or gaming I rang them up.
To my astonishment you had to give your National Insurance number to qualify.
This is from a company who this year made 7. 4 BILLION in profit.
What highly paid manager thought this one up.
It's indefensible.
It's derading to be asked by a telecommunicationcompany for your National Insurance details.
I'm speechless",0
"My broadband keeps dropping out all of the time and when it is working, it runs slowly, even with their latest updates that were supposed to make download speeds faster. I don't seem to be able to get through to anyone to ask for an engineer to look at the connection. This has been happening for a couple of months now.
I just keep being told to switch it off to reset it, but this doesn't work.
Currently wouldn't recommend Virgin Media broadband to anyone.",0
"Service appears to have collapsed!

Very hard to cancel
Try and chat on web, no you need to phone them
Phone them, no you need to text them
Start to text them, no you need to whatsapp

Meanwhile repeatedly asking same info and taking forever",0
Took out the 3 month 'trial' to watch GOT. When it was finished I checked on the Now TV site to ensure that my trial would end without my having to cancel it. However they then took a ¬£7.99 out of my account. My bank wouldn't refund as I had a subscription. However I was sure that the deal I had would end after the 3 months. So I went back on their web site and went through pages and pages of forms to cancel. They are very tricky as when I had thought that I had cancelled I found that there was another form. I left the site when I was certain I had cancelled - to be emailed a month later saying that they couldn't collect my payment! It is impossible to cancel their 'trials' so please don't apply for one.,0
Very poor service no phone to contact customers and no communication between customers and stores in a modern world like this saying you can't reach a customer on your phone is an absolute lie. Don't buy anything from this company after big problems,0
"Really disappointed.
Product has not arrived it was supposed to be here by 7th and it‚Äôs now 12th. The tracking number is not giving any information besides dispatched on the 5th.

Tried to contact Optimalprint and the only way is via a chat bot that isn‚Äôt helpful at all, not even a customer service e mail available?!!

Paid extra for the years delivery as planned to use them again, which is now a waste of money.",0
"Tried returning a scruffy rental phone within the 14 day cooling off period. The links for return labels don't seem to work (see other reviews) but still managed to return the phone within time. Received an email on day 14 telling me they had the phone and processed the return, but I had returned it outside of the ""30 day"" time limit and I would be charged ¬£50. Complained and now they are asking for proof of postage before they will escalate ‚Äì even though they HAVE the phone and an email THEY SENT me within 14 days telling me they had received it. They have no number to call, sporadic responses to emails. Still waiting for refund. Not happy.",0
Never delivered my gift for Christmas ordered it on 11th December it‚Äôs the 27th December still no show will never use again,0
"The saga continues‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve posted about issues in getting my money returned for items I‚Äôve never received. This call marks the tenth time I‚Äôve had to contact Very to rectify the issue. This does not include time spent on Webchat and messenger where I was assured by an advisor I would receive an email officially logging my complaint (obviously this never materialised).

I spoke to an advisor today who actually seemed helpful, polite and interested in rectifying the issue which was a stark change to the 9 previous calls I‚Äôve had to make. She guaranteed she had personally processed the refund and I wouldn‚Äôt have to chase it again. I have heard this before, time will tell, fingers crossed.

For my troubles I was refunded the ¬£3.99 delivery charge for the item I never received so every cloud and all that‚Ä¶.",0
"Lies
This company advises that payment will be made on the same day as ordered received.
My order was delivered at 835am and no payment that day. Live chat no longer a thing and multiple emails being ignored.
Avoid
To add insult to injury. They have advised that there is a problem with my camera and marked the device down by ¬£400! Which is completely untrue. I have sent my own evidence and have asked them for their.

"Changing installation dates again! Hanging up 4 times when I finally get through to speak to someone after being transferred 5 times. You guaranteed a January installation when I bought the package, then changed it! Why not tell me there is a chance of it changing instead of promising it will be in when I ask. Worst communication and customer service and by far the worst for lying just to get me to buy.",0
Have spent 4.5 hours today (in 1 hour blocks) in a queue trying to get through to teamknowhow. The laptop repair for my 12 year old daughter cannot be completed until we have spoken. Stuck in limbo. Extremely shocked at this poor customer service. In the meantime have a daughter at home unable to do any school work.,0
"Ridiculous service, I had a final month's payment that I tried to settle and was charged a myriad of extra fees that amounted to three times what I owed.

Dealing with customer service is a nightmare and I'm still not even sure if my account is closed even after I paid all their extra fees.

Not worth the trouble. Go with another service.",0

"Paid for delivery between 1pm - 5pm. Called at 5pm to chase the delivery only for them to tell me delivery was likely to be 7pm! So I couldn't cook dinner for my baby, and we'd then expect a delivery at her bedtime.

Delivery then turned up just after 6pm after I'd then cancelled my evening plans. I'd had an electrician around from 5pm waiting to fit the cooker too.

Basically, due to Curry's bad planning, the cooker cost me an extra ¬£50+ in cancelled gym classes, cancelled babysitters and delayed electricians. Will be ordering from ao next time!",0
"Carphone warehouse in Meole Brace, Shrewsbury. For a week Carphone Warehouse have been fobbing me off, saying my complaint about a phone that I bought there had been escalated to this branch. No reply whatsoever. Quality of service can be rated on reaction to when something goes wrong with a product, in this case a Samsung A50 that has stopped working, through no fault of my own. I would not go back to this shop in the future.",0

"Worst customer service. I have been with them 20 years in total. They supplied me a phone that was a factory defect. I had to send it off to be repaired and they couldn't because its a factory manufacturing defect. The sent a nearly new ie refurbished second hand phone as a replacement. They had told me I could trade in my phone to pay off my contract and get in upgrade and new tariff. The phone they sent wasn't the one I sent. A refurbished one was sent back to me and a trade in price is ¬£18.75.
I have raised a complaint that is taking ages and you can not contact the store or anyone to help when they should replace the phone with a new phone as I'm paying for that in contact!
Will not renew a contract with them sgsin because of the hassle its caused and appalling response",0
"Horrific company. Constantly trying to up rates for an awful service, can't go anywhere in London and expect service.

"Horrible, horrible service. Internet has been down nearly every day over the last week. It's down again now and I'm using my phone for internet. They don't give you any information.

Now they will likely provide an online link so I can open a complaint that will be ignored along with the rest. No thank you - other options out there.",0
"My fridge freezer stopped working this morning (11th June) phoned the company for repairs, the caller on the phone said the earliest date would be the 19th June, the reason why is because there wasn't any workers in my area.
I asked to speak to a manager, when on the phone she blatantly kept talking over me. I said to her its a fridge freezer i can't afford to replace the food, I was told there isn't any workers in my area? when i asked why have this insurance for people if you can't provide the service. Her reply was because the repair men in my area are dead from corona ... very condescending attitude passive aggressive.
I said you can not speak to a customer like that she continued saying a repair man will be out on the 19th due to covid everything is delayed etc i said so what am i supposed to do in the meantime regarding the food her reply was unfortunately we don't cover food costs, just being ignorant knowing.
Then she kept on being passive aggressive when i said i'm really not happy with the attitude! if i recorded this and showed currys then she said i have not giving you permission to record me! i said no doubt the call will be recorded anyways then she quickly said i'm hanging up the phone call when i said you can not talk to customers this way.

This isn't the first time this company has been lax when providing repair help",0
"If I could give this a minus figure, I would. 2 months into a free 3 month contract & it is constantly down. Every day I get error msgs stopping me from using it.

Placed an order for a t shirt on 9th December. Optimal print despatched it on the 11th and that is as far as it went.

Ive been with them donkey years. Times are hard things need to change. They wouldnt change my tarrif would only upgrade amd charge more.....
Even when i said 4 month left which is fake as they added months to an upgrade which ended 6 montjs ago...
I even said right i will pay to end contract amd start fresh to get a cheaper deal and was still told cant.

Ive been arguing for 6 months and given up with them complete clueless fools rubbish service on off network. So now i just cancelled broadband and phone tgey can swivel will be changing wifes and kids are leaving at end of there term too.

I bought a Samsung 8 refurbished. I was told it would take 10 days. I cancelled the order on 9 April 2020 and was told that it would take 14 days to get a refund. I have been told due to Covid 19 I will not get my refund now until 1 July 2020. I appreciate there might be a delay due to Covid 19 but 3 months is not acceptable. I would not recommend using this firm to anyone absolutely disgraceful.,0
"Stay well clear, always had internet quality issues and rang Talk Talk to cancel my contract in July 2022. Was told at the time that this was now in hand as BT would take over, I had nothing more to do. We are now in November and I have recieved bills from Talk Talk and a debt collectors letter. Four hours later after thinking it was a mistake on their behalf
and Talk Talk staff arguing with me after confirming I did cancel in July. I was told because I did not give specific information about the terminology of how BT were taking over, I was liable and the termination of contract in July was not accepted. Hours later I realised that what I was expected to do was engineer the change myself and report in technical terms how I did this, thats actually what Talk Talk implied. They said it was in the terms and conditions, therefore they now said it was my fault. I eventually paid the bill as BT said they would reimburse me due to confusion about what Talk Talk expected from a customer. I could now cancel the contract, having paid and was referred to another department. But wait....another clause, despite re-confirming that I had cancelled the contract in July which was not accepted, I now have a 30 day cooling off period until it would be cancelled meaning December is when I will be free of that horrific company. Even BT remarked on this being unacceptable and crafty.

Talk Talk initially blamed BT and then said it was my fault after I repeated what BT had suggested. Talk Talk were referring to a specific cable used that I did not report therefore tough luck, I should have known and explained the cross over process which the BT engineer carried out. Honestly from day one, its been hell with Talk Talk from poor service to awful customer service and long phone waiting times.",0
"I bought a phone contract with them and the rep also offered to give me a temporary sim until my wifi was installed but my wifi was delayed in starting for which I didn't get any compensation as promised but they dedicated my direct debit on time, also once it was up and running I called up to cancel that sim and they say I will have to pay a termination fee thats absurd and they didn't tell me this when I bought the sim, loots and waste of customer service",0
"As others have said, they are offering a much better deal for new customers in their Black Friday Sale. As a customer with an existing pass I am not entitled to the same deal. I have expressed my annoyance that once again they are trying to attract new customers and existing customers are subsiding the new ones.

Trying to contact customer service is a joke, as the only way seems to be live chat and it is very slow. As they don't value their customers I won't be renewing my passes.",0

Now tv stopped our Internet earlier because we are leaving them. The reason for us to leave is the worst customer experience and the fact we didn't have Internet 5 m away from the router.

When you call them customer services gets connected after hours of wait on phone. When you speak to them they have multiple teams e.g fault service , diffrent for cancellation and for anything and they will keep you shuffling across various teams till you get frustrated and eventually drop the phone.

Regarding the speed they have perfect excuse always that guaranteed speed is only till router.

Since they were not able to provide guaranteed speed when I asked for cancellation, then they charged me cancellation fee on top. Total harassment.

Then they try to sell me a service that I didn't want (BT Halo) instead of fixing the problem.

Been having quite a few different issues recently. Think when I first joined complaints and issues were handled immediately. Now you end up having to make a number of calls to fix simple issues.

This is after speaking to 2 different really dim customer relation after complaining to their CEO.

Can tell I'm not alone 7% excellent on here and over 80% for really bad. Says it all.

"After switching Now Broadband sent an email (which I missed) containing small print advice that they were changing my phone number (I've raised a complaint to OFCOM who have levied fines on providers for doing this).

So I accepted my fate that I was stuck with a new phone number and Now Broadband. However, the new broadband phone number wasn't working either. I explained to an agent that my wife and I are both 85 yrs old, highly vulnerable and depend upon our phone for carer and emergency services, the agent assured me that the engineer visit the following day would result in the phone number being activated. I received further assurances from another agent that everything would be fine after the engineer had been. After waiting the 5 hours from 08:00 until 13:00 for the engineer, the engineer didn't turn up, I chased Now Broadband who matter of factly told me the engineer had been cancelled. I told another agent to stop the transfer, that one way or another I will get back to my existing provider and that I will be raising a complaint to OFCOM and to the Ombudsman. This morning I received a message from Openreach advising an engineer will be attending tomorrow to activate the phone number and I also received an email advising they will be billing m ¬£18 for the first month's service. At the start of this switch I thought ""what could possibly go wrong"", well Now Broadband have excelled themselves at finding every possible way of failing to comply with regulation and screwing up their service",0
"While I appreciate COVID 19 situation, I would not recommend using this provider. I have been a loyal customer, however my recent purchase turned out to be a non purchase as the advertised phone dint exist. After 2 weeks of chasing cancelled my order. This was back in Earle May.

I‚Äôm still waiting for my refund. Just to be clear, I have purchased items over internet and had to cancel some and received my refund.

Not sure why Quick mobile fix cannot refund in a reasonable time.",0
"Don‚Äôt waste your time or money, they rob you blind, sent my tv off for what was a minor repair, and they droped and cracked the screen, as it‚Äôs a curve tv they unable to repair it, I was advised on 3 occasion that I would get what I paid as there no comparison available, when the voucher came it was short by ¬£550.00 I exculated it and the staff have no idea what they are doing and all lie through the teeth and the 3 people notes who quoted I would get the full amount had been deleted, they have also turned the complaint email off so you have no way of going higher,

Total sham buy products else where as these people have no customer serve skills",0
Absolutely the very worst level of customer service ever received. Have now waited over 7 weeks to get a simple broadband upgrade yet Bt seem unable to resolve what are relatively minor technical issues despite being a supposed Tech company. will move my requirements to Sky who are infinitely more customer focused. 45 years with BT ruined in 6/7 weeks,0
Incorrect phones recieved and very slow response to the issue... deeply dissapointed,0
"A bunch of scammers, avoid at all costs. Failed to deliver the iPhone, refused to communicate despite repeated emails. Eventually having to claim via my bank. Will be reporting to trading standards. DO NOT USE THEM.",0
"So sad, they used to be so good many years back when I had issues with my iPad from Currys. Now you cant even get a straight answer, everyone tells you different things and the repair waiting times are RIDICULOUS how is anyone supposed to go without a washing machine for over a week. I even tried to cancel my know How plan and they were unable to help so I just stopped my direct debit. This whole pandemic is being totally milked for everything it's got.",0
"Right, to begin with, it is beyond me how the company even have three stars! DO NOT USE

I ordered a phone at the beginning of September 2020 (biggest mistake I have made all year). It was downhill from there. Iphone X brought for ¬£427.99. It said it would come within 7-10 working days. I was still waiting 2 weeks later and the company said there were delays due to Covid -19 (totally understandable). They tried to reel me in by offering a ¬£10 refund for the inconvenience (up till now, I still have not received) A MONTH later, the phone arrived, in which I sent straight back. It was faulty and frankly, I just wanted to have my money back. I sent the phone back (special next day delivery) on 4th October 2020. The company kept saying they did not receive the phone however, I had proof from the type of delivery i choose, which was tracked and signed for, that it was indeed at the depot. I had to wait until 27th October 2020 to get confirmation that they had the phone, in which would be a 14 waiting period to receive a full refund. This (low and behold) was not received and now, December 21st 2020 (2 months later), I am still awaiting a refund. Please, do not use these people under any circumstances. Their prices look great, but it also comes along with ignored emails, horrible customer service (they dont even have a contact number), empty promises, no refund ect. I have done some research and spoken to people who have used this company and I believe many of the reviews on here are FAKE, as nobody i have spoken to has had good service from them. You are better of using Music Magpie, or any other phone site.

Update (4.1.2021): Following an email sent on 21st December, I still have not received a reply as to why i have not received a refund.",0
"I have ordered a hair dryer on black Friday. 2 later item was diverted because could not be delivered, for me unknown reason.
I chatted with Currys, get promise item will be redelivery soon.
Week ago get other promise this will be delivered. Then I went on holiday, came back and did find the item in box. Connected to the chat ask them to deliver the item.
The Currys decided to cancelled the order without my agreement.
The customer service is poor. The guys from customer are not helpful at all. They have not clue where item was or how to sort issues out.
I can not recommend online shopping with this company",0
Dreadful experience. Receiving 2-3 unwanted sales phone calls per day. When I try to request removal from their database the caller hangs up. Please STOP calling me.,0
"Well it's been a long wait but today I left Vodafone after 13 years...

Vodafone cancelled gbnews so now I've cancelled Vodafone

"This is an absolutely terrible company with a dreadful reputation for failing to deliver on promises.

I cancelled my order on 10th February due to delays in despatching my item. I am still waiting for my ¬£100 refund. I was told 14 days, then end of April and now 9th June.

Check out social media platforms and forums and you will see hundreds of people in the same position.

Never ever use this company!",0
"Very concerning behaviour from this company. I was told last month that I didn't owe anything on the contract I had been trying to cancel for 4 months.

I discovered on my credit report that I was in arrears with them to my surprise. I called and paid the outstanding balance, was assured that would be the end of it.

1 day later I get a letter from a debt agency and a subsequent email demanding payment to them within 14 days.

This is concerning practice and very likely illegal.

I won't even mention how it was incompetence on Vodafones end that made it so difficult to end my contract in the 1st place.

Will never go near this company again that's for sure what a mistake it was taking out a ¬£6 a month sim with them.",0
Absolutely shocking how terrible this company is i purchased a phone which was supposed to be next day delivery and they said it was supposed to arrive on the 5th of june after after calling them 15 times and using the live chat about 5 times i received my phone today(27th August) i had to wait almost 3 months for a phone which i was supposed to receive the next day. I will never be buying anything from here again,0
"I've spent ¬£400 so far and had no business through this service. Also paid for Elite Pro - rubbish.

Total waste of time and money for us. Other might have had more success.",0
"If there was a choice for 0 stars I would‚Äôve given them that. I placed my first ever order with Curry‚Äôs 2 weeks ago, a washing machine due to be delivered by ‚Äòteam know how‚Äô last Sunday morning. On the day of delivery I received a text to say it would be delivered from 2pm-6pm. So after waiting in all morning, I now had to wait all afternoon too. 6pm came and went with no sign of a washing machine and no further communication from ‚Äòteam know how‚Äô and being Sunday, their phone lines were closed... Monday I send a message to customer services asking where my delivery got to. Their response was that it had ‚Äúbeen put on the wrong van‚Äù and will now be delivered next Saturday! I was asked if I‚Äôd like a morning or afternoon slot of which I chose the morning slot. I have now just received a delivery reminder text for Saturday AFTERNOON! So again, my weekend plans revolve around a flippin‚Äô washing machine. It‚Äôs ridiculous. Not to mention the fact that I‚Äôve had no access to a washing machine for over a week now! It‚Äôs safe to say that I will not be ordering anything from them again in the future.",0
"Since upgrading to their ‚Äúfaster‚Äù package, I haven‚Äôt had a reliable connection in weeks. First they forgot to send me an upgraded router that could cope with the new package, and now that‚Äôs it here it still just doesn‚Äôt work. Every customer service team I speak to is useless and reads the same script over and over again. Apparently engineers have been out over the last two days and they cheekily sent a text saying my internet is now fixed but it‚Äôs not. THEN they have the cheek to try and charge me for an engineer to come out and fix THEIR fault (as confirmed by BT worker a couple of weeks ago who was working in the area, it‚Äôs their fault).

Sick of dealing with them. Wish I hadn‚Äôt bothered.

Their online chat service is unreliable and often closed. Utterly disappointing and will be cancelling.",0
I ordered a mobile phone and did not receive it within the timescale stated. I have e-mailed them twice but not even a reply. I am a 66 yearold disabed woman and need a phone (it is a lifeline for me). As a pensioner I cannot afford to lose over ¬£300. I wish I had read the reviews below before ordering and then I would not have!!!,0
I recently contacted shell energy about my mother in laws phone . we canceled her phone as she has gone into end of life care .they then send a threatening letter stating they want there router back .I respond to them stating my mother in law has never had broadband or a router . they ask for extra info gave them that then they say they cant discuss as we are not the account holder .which bit off she is in a hospice on end off life care dont they understand !!!!! nice to see a company with compassion not this company,0

Contacted customer service and after a long wait told that they would get back to me.

"Terrible service. Ordered an upgrade from what I thought was a reputable company. From start to finish it was very amateurish! Once my upgrade was finalised and they had taken my money, my SIM got cancelled and I had no network to make or receive phone calls! Tried to get it sorted out with them but had no responses to emails and forget about calling them! My new phone came with a new SIM (I was feeling very hopeful) put the new SIM in the new phone......nothing!! The reason my phone is so important is because I run a business which relies very heavily on contact. I have now lost 2 potentially large contracts at an already difficult time because I haven't been able to keep in touch via phone. It is now 6 days later and still no network coverage, I have a new SIM being delivered which I hope will work and fix this terrible service I have received! Stay well away if you want reliability!!",0
My package was left outside in the rain by the courier. There was water damage through to the product to which I notified ghd immediately with pictures and have heard nothing. This was supposed to be a gift and now it‚Äôs too late.,0
After applying for said phone and online being agreed . I then had to phone carphone warehouse to actually find out if I had the contract. To find out the hold up was that they needed more information. So once I'd done that my new phone came. Then traded my old phone in which I thought I could get more money on eBay but stuff it the money will buy me out of my old contract do that will do. 2 weeks later I heard nothing back from them so had to chase them again. To be told there was a fault with my phone. Asked what the said fault was they said there look into it.... Now 3 weeks in and I'm still chasing them with zero help. So my advise is ONLY SHOP IN THE SHOP,0
"Absolutely awful company! I was with Three for 4 years and had constant issues with poor or no signal and an increasingly rising bill. Eventually decided to leave, making sure I stuck to the terms of my contract and confirmed the minimum term date with Three to avoid receiving any charges. Was assured over live chat that there were no outstanding charges on my account when leaving and that I would not receive any future bills. Two months later I get a bill for ¬£58 and upon contacting Three I was informed that this was due to ending my contract early!!! After multiple arguments and back and forth with Three over live chat (avoid phoning as there is no proof of your conversations!) they began coming out with numerous excuses for what this bill was for. I was eventually directed to their complaints department who presented me with yet another excuse of what the bill was supposedly for and was then offered ¬£15 off the bill. I declined and was then offered ¬£30 off which I again declined. They then said that they would settle the bill as a gesture of ‚Äògood-will‚Äô. I asked Three for proof of this which I was told I would have emailed to me- I am yet to receive this. Convinced they were trying their luck thinking they‚Äôd get the money out of me! Scammers!
Update: I have since been bombarded by phone calls from the number 0800 033 8015, which is Three‚Äôs debt number, demanding I pay the ¬£58. I spoke to Three AGAIN as still no proof has been sent that they have settled the bill, they have assured me they have but I have zero trust in them as a company. Dodgy people!",0
I have now received yet another email telling me that my refund date has been pushed back. It's the third time now. I am trying to get some answers but the live chat operators are constantly repeating the same excuses and stating that they (account department) don't operate via telephone. It's going to be 4 months since i have started this painful process and I still don't know if i will be getting my money back for a product that was never delivered. DO NOT USE THEM.,0
"Took out a 24 month 4g broadband contract in store, no signal at my address though so returned device the following working day and the store cancelled the contract.

Roll forward 3 weeks and a charge appears on my bank account - I'd been told to expect a small amount to cover any data I'd used, but they charged me a full month+. When I queried, customer services told me the account was still active.
I asked to open a complaint process regarding this, and it took me 20 minutes of reminding them of their legal responsibilities to do so, before they agreed to, but they insisted I had to go back to the store to get it resolved. When they did open my complaint and I agreed to visit the store, they asked me if they could now close the complaint! I pointed out that they'd taken money without authorisation from my account and subjected me to a great deal of inconvenience - the complaint stood. Now they said, after I visit the store and the store call them, they will close the complaint. Again I had to insist that no, the complaint stays open until I agree it's been resolved.

At the store, they told me this was the wrong procedure and they should have rung the store on my behalf. The store had little joy trying to deal with customer services as well. In the end they completed another cancellation request and submitted it, but were unable to get confirmation that this had been processed, or what the resolution would be.

I should add that the call centres appear to be Asia based, and are staffed by some quite ridiculous people. So for example, I went through security today, name, DOB, postcode etc, and then part-way through the conversation, the guy opened a separate page on my account and demanded my name again. I pointed out that I hadn't changed identity part-way through the call, but nope - had to do it again. 5 mins later and this occurred for a 3rd time which I refused to do, so they disconnected on me.

My advice is avoid at all costs - they're cheap for a reason, and while their store staff are often excellent, the rest of the company is frankly awful.

I'm fairly sure this one is going to end up before the ombudsman, but the cost to me in time has already been significant.

It gets worse - received a response to my complaint today that reads like a joke. Again dealt with by a foreign call centre and someone who hasn't even read my complaint properly.",0
"Ordered a few handsets for ¬£99. Instead of 6 x ¬£99, carphone warehouse took 6x¬£499 out of my account and cancelled all orders. They did not refund after 5 days, i had to chargeback with my credit card provider. No reply to emails. When i called they claimed 'systems down' and refund will be issued. Will be filing criminal and civil proceedings. Beware of these guys they have fraudulent billing processes and they will be held accountable.",0

I called to cancel my BT Sport as it was out of contract and I could get the same considerably cheaper via Sky. They offered to match Sky but by the time they had added the extras, HD, multiroom etc is was twice as much. When I received the order I was shocked and cancelled immediately via their website. They were supposed to call back but didn‚Äôt claiming I had not cancelled. Fortunately I had a screenshot and proof I did, they were going to charge a cancellation fee of ¬£400+. BTs only interest is business and contracts not the consumer.",0
Scam company. Avoid at any cost. I've sent phone to trade in department but when they have received it they said it is faulty. When you call them they will ask to call back in 5 days every single time. This is dragging for ever. This should be reported and this company should be shamed for they practice.,0
"Missold a contract from store. They put me on a business‚Äôs account which I did not agree to. I tried to cancel as I‚Äôm within my 7 days webchat said I could with no fee if I went in store store said they couldn‚Äôt do it as they don‚Äôt have a returns policy. Then said I‚Äôd have to come back in to see the manger as they couldn‚Äôt do much she was on holiday.
When I called up they said I had 14 days to return it in store and said that the store need to send them and email to do this. Went back in store they said they‚Äôve never heard of this and there is nothing they can do I‚Äôve sent complaints. All sorts letters now onbudsman.

I am in my cancelling period and I want it to be honoured. I don‚Äôt want this contract and I no longer wanna be with three. As I‚Äôve been with them for many years the way I‚Äôve been treat and spoke to has played allot on mt mental health and made my depressing bad again.

Not to mention them taking more money than expected and agreed to also getting massive bills. Saying I need to pay which was not stated when talking to the advisor.",0
Very disappointed with their price promise. Did all that wa required within 7 days as the video suggests and still not heard anything. I have contacted them 3 times on the live chat with a promise to get back to me but nothing. Vet disappointed....,0

"AO has got to be one of, if not the most terrible and unreliable, companies in existance. After the dishwasher was purchased, we're told it is a weeks waiting time until delivery. I feel that's acceptable, although not brilliant.

A date and delivery slot was provided - a 4 hour window.(1200-1600) Thats a significant window.. so your whole day will need to be given up for that, really. Again, acceptable but not great.

The problem comes when you've waited a week from purchase, given up a full day - see the delivery van arrive - park outside.. wait patiently for the buzzer to go(we're 5 floors up) However, the buzzer doesn't go; the delivery status screen changes to 'Failed Delivery'. Looked out of the window again, and they've driven off.

I call the AO customer service team who are quick to tell me that the intercom isn't working. Having checked the intercom, found it in good working order, it's clear no attempt was made at all. Tremendous.

The joy continues.. customer service tell me that there's nothing they can do, as its my word against theirs. This would be true, unless we have an intercom that tracks and logs all calls made, which we do.

The response to this was. ""I can put it down as driver feedback?"" Problem solved.. thanks very much.

So, we need to try and re-arrange a delivery. The earliest Im offered is in 13 days time.

"This is by far the most shambolic company I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. I ordered a fridge freezer to be delivered on Sunday. On delivery the incompetent driver said he couldn‚Äôt bring the fridge inside as it wouldn‚Äôt fit without removing the doors and couldn‚Äôt do that because it is an extra charge. He then re booked for delivery 2 days later. After taking a day off work to wait for the fridge to be delivered the designated delivery time passed. After ringing the help line and getting through the garbage automated service I eventually got through to another incompetent employee who said the delivery driver hadn‚Äôt entered the new date and I would have to wait a further day for the item to be deliver. I couldn‚Äôt take another day off work so paid an employee to sit at my house and wait for the fridge. I returned home to notice that they have delivered the wrong fridge.

"PC Specialist are great when you buy from them.
HOWEVER, if something goes wrong, their promises to return phone calls NEVER happen. lf you are very persistent you may eventually get somewhere, but don't bank on it.
In my case it took many phones calls to get them to agree to sent a replacement for a brand new battery which was clearly faulty. Even then they expected me to pay for the return of the faulty battery, wait for them to confirm it was faulty and only then send out a replacement.
This replacement battery has also failed.
Needless to say they have not and will not replace the battery, quickly glossing over that fact and trying to sell me another Laptop battery, which can be purchased cheaper elsewhere (Amazon)
Avoid this company.

Update:
The below promised further contact via e-mail from PC Specialist never happened.
This simply confirms my earlier experiences with this company.

Further update:
'Chris' from PC Specialist phoned me on the morning of Friday 2nd December. It wsa a constructive conversation which ended with Chris advising that he would take the discussed proposals to his line manager and get back to me. Chris did indeed call me back later (5.13pm). Unfortunately I was unable to take the call. Chris left a message saying that he would put the companys proposal in writing via an e-mail.
I tried to return his call. The person who answered the phone refused to put me through to Chris due to GDPR. WHAT !!!
He was very confident in using the anagram for General Data Protection Regulations several times, but clearly hasnt the slightest clue what they are.
The promissed e-mail regarding the companys proposal has never been received.
The battery I purchased on Amazon has now been installed and cycled through sveral times, thereby proving beyond any reasonable doubt that the battery supplied by PC Specialist is indeed faulty.",0

"I have been with vodafone for a number of years and yes they are very reassuring when it comes to a renewal then once again you find that is the end of the service .

I then telephoned vodafone asking them to enquirer a track or ask about this number and how they got mine ,as I felt uneasy to receive a call like this without warning and from abroad .

"This is the worst service from any company i have had. Tried multiple times to cancel or change my mobile to pay as you go due to moving abroad. I tried before leaving... they kept on billing me... i tried when abroad... they said fine and that they would cancel the bill, but kept on billing me. Finally i receive a debt collection notice after cancelling my direct debit - but every time i attempt to call and after putting in the phone number it is about, the phone call is terminated without me being able to talk to anyone.

Please do not use this incredibly poor company unless you are prepared to receive absolutely no customer service whatsoever.",0

"Took out phone insurance through carphone warehouse 2 years ago, have just bought a new phone and so wanted to cancel this as I no longer need it and it has been expensive to not use. Have had my cancel request denied 5 times which is quite frankly laughable if anything. When I tried to call I got through to an answering machine, which again is laughable seeing as it‚Äôs 10am on a Friday morning. Eventually just cancelled the direct debit so good luck to them. Not sure how they are at actually insuring something but I wouldn‚Äôt sign up if you ever want to leave.",0

I have 200mbps broadband and a wired connection and it is still rubbish.

"I have never in my time ever experienced such horrendously incompetent and greedy business practices. I was in a property for 6 months without them ever connecting my wifi. I had 4 engineers come over, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM said that they need to go and get and extra part to finish the installation, just for none of them to return. I was endlessly on the phone to support asking why this was. I was promised compensation, none of which ever came. The ""solution"" to this was to open a new account, send me more routers (that wouldn't work and I would have to send back) and send out more engineers. I now have over 3 accounts in my name for BT, they continued to send me more routers that I didn't ask for and equipment that didn't work. This finally came to an end when I got charged ¬£113 for failing to send back equipment which I already had, as I sent it back months ago I didn't have a tracking number, so they refused to refund me. I have spent a huge amount of money on this company for the privilege of taking time out of my day to send back countless routers, no internet connection and a large chunk of my life waiting for, or talking to customer service for them to repeat the cycle over again. Please avoid this company like the plague, it's the absolute worst I have ever been treated by a company, I feel genuinely robbed of my time and money, never to see a single result.",0
I should have had my broadband connected over a week ago and despite multiple calls and a visit from openreach I'm still no closer due to their complete lack of competence. Every call involves multiple transfers as you constantly get fobbed off by ill trained and often rude and patronising overseas call center staff. An absolute shambles of a company.,0
One of the worst broadband providers I‚Äôve dealt with. Really useless. They cancelled my broadband 3 days before I was due to move house and when I got through to the cancellations team they said it wasn‚Äôt cancelled and I should speak to the technical difficulties team who would help. They were also rubbish as they said my account has been cancelled so there‚Äôs nothing they can do about it. I was passed from department to department until I got back to the retentions team who said that‚Äôs it definitely not been cancelled but no one can do anything this close to the move date. Which doesn‚Äôt make sense as I‚Äôm still paying ¬£31 for something you aren‚Äôt providing. I spent over three hours on the phone with them and they had no remorse.

"sent a TV for repair more than a month ago. never a single update call from Curry's/Team KnowHow in all this time. We were made to call them each time taking hours on the phone in the middle of the work day.

Anyway, after weeks of us having to call them, each time we were told that covid had disrupted service so they had no updates due to how overwhelmed the team were.

After more than a month we finally get a call from the repairs team saying the TV has been written off and we'd get an email with a voucher code with some money to use towards a new purchase. We say ok and wait for this email to arrive. Of course, nothing arrives so once again we spend hours on the hone to get an update on this. We finally get told a code over the phone and when we try to use it, surprise, surprise, it doesn't work!!! We are now stuck with no TV, no voucher, having to call them back once again, only to be put on hold and sent around in circles!!

Would have been much better to have used and supported a local tradesman/electrician instead and saved myself this torture!! I'm forgoing the voucher and buying a new TV elsewhere. Not worth repeating this should something go wrong with the next TV only to save a few quid! Learnt my lesson and never again!",0
"If I could give them no stars I would! I had copper broadband & phone with them for 3 years. But spent nearly 4 months with no connection at all this summer due to their refusal to reconnect me!

I‚Äôd always paid my bills in full and on time and in April this year I renewed my contract with them. But they apparently made an ‚Äòerror‚Äô their end and I was disconnected by openreach! They then spent 3 and a half months telling me I couldn‚Äôt have my copper line reconnected and that I had to have fibre due to ‚Äòbusiness reasons‚Äô! - part of their big push to get everyone on fibre. I work from home full time but couldn‚Äôt for almost 4 months because I had no working landline & no broadband! I waited and waited for copper reconnection or fibre ‚Ä¶ and absolutely nothing happened, nothing was installed!

In the end after they cancelled one connection date in Sept apparently because of another problem their end, and then rescheduled it for the bank holiday of the queens funeral!! Which obviously was never going to happen, I told them I was going elsewhere. 2 weeks later Sky had me reconnected! So quick! No problems at all! I do wish I‚Äôd changed provider much sooner!
Vodafone‚Äôs customer service is absolutely the worst I have ever experienced. I really am not joking! If you have to deal with them get everything in writing. Don‚Äôt deal with them by phone. On the phone they just tell you one lie after another and the next agent you speak to readily admits the person before them lied to you. Lying to customers and then just admitting it, before telling more lies, just seems to be systemic in the culture of this company‚Äôs customer service policies! They really don‚Äôt care‚Ä¶because they know their so big. Losing one customer really doesn‚Äôt matter to them.

I really hope others don‚Äôt have the same dreadful experience I did. It was miserable having to deal with them, you really can‚Äôt trust a word their customer services or complaints teams tell you.

"After having moved away from an excellent energy company (Pure Planet died because of the energy crisis), it has been a deeply disappointing to be with Shell Energy.
After having been told the advantages of a smart meter, I agreed to have one installed in early August 2022... and then the problems began.
The first thing is that the meter did not register at all - with no readings for gas or electricity usage. I contacted Shell Energy via their chat service (spending an hour at least waiting to get to an operative) only to be told that the smart meter could take up to a month to come online. I then contact them at the start of September, as the meter was still not online. Again having to go through the chat (another hour wasted) and eventually having to send them an email via their website. They responded by saying that the gas meter was not working at all and it would need to be replaced. I replied to them to say, OK, I give you permission to come into the garden (there is no fence on this part) to repair it at any time. Almost two weeks later there has been no action on the part of Shell Energy. No attempt to contact me, no attempt to make a repair. So, today I go on to the chat system (you are at position 44!) Over an hour and a half later, I come to position 1, there is noise and my chat is disconnected. No indication of any position in the queue. I've merely been bumped off the queue.
In all my years in business, and as a consumer, I have never come across such poor customer service as I have received over the last few weeks.
Out of 10, would I recommend Shell Energy to any friends, family or acquaintances? The answer has to be an emphatic ZERO out of 10.
This is my first ever Trust Pilot review, but I am at wits end.

Dear Sean, thank you for your reply. I did indeed receive a telephone call today. As I am a teacher, I rarely have my phone on my person. In this case, my phone was in my work bag and as I pulled it out of my bag, the person rang off. I could see it was from Shell Energy. They couldn't have rung my phone for more than 20 seconds. This was disappointing, but I guess they hit their call quota for the day? Sadly, I didn't have time before my next lesson to wait on the phone again.
Please can someone call me between 1255-1345hrs or after 1600hrs on Tuesday 13 September 2022? Alternatively, I don't see why our communication can't happen via email? Please help me.",0

Don't be fooled by Studio's payment plan offers as no one in customer service even knows they exist!

Another call to customer service and yet again they offer no help. Apparently its interest from a 6 month interest free plan which ended on the 28/12/2022 (that they have said I don't actually have, even though its visible on every statement up to September) and I paid off before the end of September.

How difficult is it to see that my account payment history equals the total amount of my order and there for = paid. Honestly it is baffling how little help studio's teams offer.

But I never thought of photographing the disgusting pizza before I threw it in the bin. So they said they can‚Äôt help me. So I was not offered a refund or a replacement.

"AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!

Ordered a phone in early July, it never appeared so after a month I asked for a refund.

Almost three months later and there‚Äôs alway a reason the refund hasn‚Äôt appeared, I‚Äôve started small claims court proceedings against them.

Update:
As you can see from their response below, quick mobile fix pay absolutely no attention to what you say and send the same stock answers to every email. They even had this review taken down, telling trustpilot I was not a real ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù. Not only do they have my email address in their records but they have it in the court documents (which they have responded to, but only asking for an extra 14 days to respond!). Makes you wonder...how many other people have not had their refunds and taken them to court not to be able to identify me! Either that or they (as I suspect) want to try and stop the truth being published!",0
"Firstly my connection kept dropping whilst I was working, I work from home and my phone calls for work rely on my wifi connection through my laptop. For over a year I‚Äôve not had an issue it‚Äôs been perfect.

Last month the connection kept dropping on me repeatedly leading to my system to go down and calls dropping in work. I contacted BT who sent an engineer and the engineer come out. The engineer thought it was an issue with the socket, so he replaced it for me as he said the socket was over 10yrs old. One thing I don‚Äôt understand thought is when the engineer fitted my router a year ago why did they not say it was old then if this can cause problems?!

The engineer fixed it, and this then has been fine since and not a problem until, the last few weeks the connection has been dropping repeatedly again, I raised a complaint and offered ¬£10 off my bill and another engineer was booked.

The engineer then cancelled the appointment but the lady rang me and rearranged, hopefully the next engineer doesn‚Äôt cancel but this whole experience has been a nightmare.

I wouldn‚Äôt be usually too bothered but I rely on wifi for work.",0
I have wasted at least four phone calls and a visit to one of their offices to try and remove some additional services that I never requested but appeared on my bill. I never ordered their VIP TV package or their halo broadband package (not needed for a small flat) but have been charged for them for three months despite sending back the unwanted halo equipment they sent me. One customer service rep tells me there are records of the phone calls and then the next one tells me there is no record of me cancelling the services within the 14 days. They now tell me I have no chance of getting any of that money back and I should just be grateful that they can actually cancel the service! I originally changed to BT to take advantage of a lower price than I was paying to Virgin but I have ended up paying more and having slower broadband and far worse customer service!,0
"Don't trust Three.

I have wasted hour after hour of my time over the phone trying to get to the bottom of it and still haven't gotten any clear answers from them. Go to Virgin - you can use your data when travelling in the EU without being charged an arm and a leg each day. Three is no longer customer focused.",0
Absolutely retarted company. First they slowed my network coverage. Then they said its because you need to upgrade your handset so I did. Still same issues.

Nearly lost my job because of these guys as I use the phone for work and rely on the data. Many times I had to leave work cause I had no Internet. Please guys stay away. Nothing but scammers,0

After a month it was returned to me with no explanation and importantly, no payment.

After a few attempts I have still been unable get an explanation from CPW's customer service on why the phone was returned. Interestingly though, one of their more helpful CS representatives did say that they get more phone calls about trade-ins not being honoured than anything else!

I even raised a case on resolver.co.uk but CPW haven't responded to that either. So it is now time to escalate it.

I'm about to start a claim though the small claims court so am confident I'll get my money and costs back, but it shouldn't have to be this difficult.

"Having been told that there would be a seamless process to transfer broadband from EE to BT (as part of the same company) we have now been cut off by EE and told that it will take over 20 days to get connected to BT and I'm not 100% convinced that will happen. Told four different stories by different people at BT and nobody seems to understand the impact of 20 days out on two people who work from home and are totally dependent on internet access. Think there have been problems every time I've dealt with BT over the last 30 years. They say they are making efforts to improve their service, but in my view they are going from bad to the worst you could possibly imagine. Wont be long before they're rated 90% bad, which certainly makes you wonder. Would love to know if there is a decent trustworthy Broadband provider out there, although I think the problem is that they are all dependent on (BT) Open Reach. Hoping we can at least still get the TV for tonight's semi final and Sunday's final.

Took up an offer which was a terrible mistake. There was no option to cancel the membership (on my account) so I was not able to cancel in the standard way. Then got charged ¬£5.

Real shame I can‚Äôt give this company a minus start review.

Having raised a complaint when they repeatedly lied about the activation date I also withdrew from the contract (I‚Äôm so glad I did as I would‚Äôve gotten involved in a months long nightmare of I stayed with them)
Having withdrawn from the contract in December 2021 they decided to close my complaint too without even looking at or addressing it. Pretty sure that‚Äôs a fail as far as the FOS is concerned.
They also said I‚Äôd be getting my ¬£50 odd refund back but here we are, nearly 2 months later into February and still no sign of a refund, despite having returned their useless kits with tue bags provided.
I‚Äôm really hoping to avoid having to call them again because it‚Äôs almost impossible to get through to someone and even if you do, you just get lied to and given false promises time and again and I really don‚Äôt want to waste anymore of my time with BT.

Im currently seeking legal advice for:
1) falsely closing down a customer complaint/not acknowledging it
2) theft of the ¬£50 odd deposit fee, which they said they would refund but still haven‚Äôt.

"Tried to upgrade to Fast Fibre and had two failed appointments. This was troublesome as I had a round trip of 500 miles to oversee the visits. Hours and hours were spent on the phone trying to sought out the situation usually with very inadequately trained telephone agents. I came to the conculsion that after 10 years TalkTalk 2022 is now a company that one can't do business with due to their obvious disregard for their customers. I cancelled and moved over to BT who have now prioritising their customer service. After closing the account with TalkTalk and receiving a letter requesting that I don't cancel the Direct Debit 'to allow the account to close smoothly' well today I checked my statement and saw that TalkTalk have continued to withdraw monthly payments. I then had to spend all morning on the telephone to the Phillipines speaking to an agent who admitted the 'mistake' and promised to stop taking monthly charge. A nightmare company who is only thinking of short term share values and recklessly abusing its customers. Failing to turn up for appointments, failing to get in touch after twice requesting a call from the complaints department, diabolical quality of customer service to the point of
deliberate disregard. There is obviously not sufficient
enforcement of standards by Ofcom allowing companies like this avoid fines. They should have their license removed. If Ofcom isn't doing their job then the governments relgulator of the regulaters, the Information Commissioner‚Äôs Office, should be doing their job.",0

NEVER EVER USE THIS COMPANY !!! 6 months of stress and numerous phone calls spending hours and hours !!! And I still have not got any response or resolution... oh and no cooker parts !",0
"Moving into a new flat , where the previous tenant was using BT before she moved out days before us. We also chose BT as it seemed logical and I thought it was a trusted company. Went through online process , chose the 18th of March as it was the earliest date (this was on 8th March) and completed the order. Our router arrives a day early (17th) which is great , our internet will be activated the next day so we are all ready to go. An engineer is booked to show up between 8am-1pm and get us all up and running (not sure what he had to do). Anyway, 1pm comes and no engineer so I call BT. They tell me there‚Äôs been a ‚Äúglitch‚Äù and the issue lies with Openreach , which may I add is owned by BT. So he tells me in 24 hours I‚Äôll hear back from the openreach team. Not ideal but ok. 24 hours passes, nothing. I ring BT again. Again, I am told 24 hours. After questioning why I‚Äôm being told the same thing again, I get put on hold and then get told I will get a call at 9pm that night. Strange but it‚Äôs better than nothing I guess. 9pm comes ,no phone call as expected. Saturday comes and I finish work at 6pm, head home and go about my usual daily routine of ringing BT about the internet I should have had days ago. Again, I‚Äôm told the classic 24 hour joke. I get an email the next day saying I‚Äôll have an update on Monday ( 22/03). This time, I do actually receive a call for once (glad to see they are finally making an effort in this relationship) but yet again they pull the timeless classic , ‚Äúyou‚Äôll hear back in 24 hours‚Äù. If by tomorrow I STILL don‚Äôt have an answer, I will be looking elsewhere. This is beyond a joke at this point. I just want internet!",0
"This is really unacceptable! This is twice you've done this to me recently! Days after I've made an online purchase ,you email me to cancel it!!

"These clowns installed smart meters at my brothers property a month ago, He is still having to call them daily to ask what his credit balance is as nothing is showing up on the meter outside or the IHD - Within the last month i have made calls several times a wk with regard to the blank meters outside and the IHD not working .This is unacceptable ; my brother is in his 60's with major health issues & he isnt getting anywhere with the meter team .How is he supposed to keep an eye on his usage when nothing is showing up . Yesterday i were told that the IHD needs replacing as its obviously faulty then an email were received saying Shell are having problems with their IHD'S . How long is this going on for as its being a month now ! Surely you need to send an engineer out or at very least another IHD . Its an absolute joke !!!",0
Very very poor internet. First week it‚Äôs good after that it‚Äôs dier. As soon as my dad is on his laptop no one else can get signal. Very very disappointed. I have the smart hub and disks which don‚Äôt do anything even though it‚Äôs all setup correctly by following the apps instructions,0
Well I wrote a review of my difficulties with Wex and trying to part exchange a Laowa 2.5-5 Macro lens. Their reply said they had sent me an email on 25th September. Well if they did I certainly didn't get it! Not even in my junk mail as they suggested. In their e-mail stream they make no mention of any part exchange price for the above lens. I have to say that zero stars rating has now gone down to minus one.,0

"Bad customer service, bought a phone and delivered. Asked for invoice and for some other details they never got back to me. Never buy from them ever.",0
"I recently bought a new phone from CW (works perfectly and arrived fast) and traded in my old device at the same time to cut some of the cost off - it was valued at ¬£100 with a promotional bonus on top. This seemed too good to be true, and clearly it was.

The phone was perfectly functioning when I sent it off in the nice jiffy bag they supplied me. Two weeks later (and a week after it had arrived, which I felt was unduly long but hey ho, Black Friday had just been so I was gonna let them off), I finally received the quote:

¬£20 was their offer. It was classed as 'non-working' - apparently my phone had 'screen burn' - a common excuse amongst these reviews, I've gathered, for scamming customers out of their money. ¬£20 for a fully-functioning, working phone is ridiculous, given that CEX would've given me ¬£100. I actually had taken a photo of the screen taken 5mins before I sent it off as proof in case I needed it. Annoyingly, CW's offer of a ¬£100 Samsung trade-in promotional bonus on top ties me in a bit, and so although I'm not a fan of companies that behave like this, I know I need to stay with them for this trade-in.

So I emailed them back, photo attached, and asked for a re-evaluation before I decided whether I wanted it sent back to me. No response.
I then emailed them again to chase it up. Still no response.
I then contacted their Twitter support. They apparently can't help me, I was told 'it's final'.
I then called up (at almost ¬£7 cost, by the way) - the lady on the phone told me that they'd chase it up for me and I'd have a response within 5 days.
10 days later - no reply and I haven't been paid 25 days after sending my phone off.

So, Carphone Warehouse have taken my phone, are claiming it is 'non-working' when it isn't and I have proof of this, won't reply to me, haven't sent it back, haven't paid me and as such have left me out of pocket - oh, and they've lost a customer in the process.

I'll be spreading the word until I have my issue resolved - and I'll update this when I do.

EDIT 05/01/2020: Responded to Craig's comment below, still awaiting an acknowledging email back a week later. Trade-In team immediately (coincidentally?) replied at 3am the day I posted this, ignoring my points about my device being perfectly functional with no screen burn, and also ignoring and my request to have it re-evaluated. Instead they gave me a random textbook definition of what the term screen burn means as apparently I'd asked them what it meant (I hadn't - I'd asked for a fair price on my phone). I'll keep updating until CW sort this out.

EDIT 08 Jan 2020:
Craig still hasn't gotten back to me about this review. Don't be fooled by the appearance of rapid customer service there...
I decided to try CW's twitter support again. I again asked whether they could chase up my request to have the photo evaluated, and I was again told that they couldn't influence the trade-in team's decision and it was final.
As this has now taken me a month, I really quite needed the money, so I then asked whether I could take the ¬£20 and continue my dispute, with any further value (which I still believe I'm owed) to be paid in the future. I was told that if I take the money, it's final - that didn't surprise me too much.

Anyway, after a bit more polite complaining they offered me a small amount of compensation, which I accepted (covers the ridiculous cost of calling their support line). I sent my email to the trade-in team saying I accept and surprise, surprise, I got no response. I'm still waiting for my money.

After a month, am I being paid for my phone? Who knows, to be honest.

EDIT 09 Jan 2020: Turns out, no, I am not. Arrived back at my student accommodation today to find that Carphone Warehouse has sent my phone back a week ago without telling me. I had not asked them to and had actually accepted the trade in a few days ago. No note, no explanation, no email to explain they've done it - just a few new faint scratches on the back of the device.
Also, I still can't see screen burn when I turn it on. Odd.

FINAL EDIT, March 2021: Gave up. Complaints team took 3wks, didn't apologise, and just told me what I already knew. Offered me ¬£20 again. I've since sold my phone for ¬£100 at CeX and got what it was actually worth - I'd advise anyone considering use CW to do the same instead.",0
"Terrible company.

They are calling me every day from a call center in london.

I'm going to seek legal advices to force them to not contact me again",0
"Contacting and dealing with customer service is truly an obstacle, trying to find LiveChat is not obvious and you have to go through many clicks to achieve this, once achieved you have to deal with advisors that act like bots and are very quick to refer concerns to next level instead of taking initiative. I personally have had consistent issues with them debiting my account even though I put a suggested payment pin in place which for sure doesn‚Äôt work, then contacting every time explaining the problem is like hitting your head of a brick wall. I‚Äôm just so surprised that they have not worked on solutions that would make this digital service awesome.",0
"They couldn't organise a p*ss up in a brewery. Had a date arranged and booked for the delivery of a dishwasher. Had everything arranged for the day being a Sunday when I was not working, then received a phone call on the morning of the delivery to say they didn't have the dishwasher to deliver even though I ordered it a week ago. The agent did say they were going to deliver a brand new one the next day when I am working, but I am pretty sure that I purchased a Brand New One when I ordered it. Highly unrecommended.",0
"Sent a perfect iphone 11 pro max in to these lot and they said it had multiple scratches on - it had NONE! Any damage was done by them. This is the 3rd time they have done this to us - phones are always cased from day 1 and had screen protectors on from day 1. We also have photos taken prior to sending but they won't accept these saying they could have been taken at any time!!! Great scam if you can get away with it and right now they are....AVOID and sell your phone on facebook instead!

Apparently the delivery team are not trained in heavy lifting.
I advise you not to order anything bigger than a kettle for delivery!

Very poor service - ordered a fridge freezer for delivery - agreed delivery date in two weeks between 7am and 6pm which was due to arrive today.
Despite speaking to driver at 5pm it never turned up.
Had to go to online chat for explanation. Apparently could not be delivered as was not marked as a heavy item (unsure how it was on a van without knowing this).
I now need to wait 72 hours before I can rearrange delivery. So having wasted a day and rearranged my kitchen to fit it in no offer of compensation just lots of apologies- very poor.",0
"Have you ever tried to send them an email with a question?? It's next to impossible, you go round in circles through loads of menus that ultimately bring you back to where you started. It's very clear that they are going out of their way to avoid spending money on support. They really don't want to help their customers, it costs too much. There are lots of 4 letter words that apply to the BT website, but HELP doesn't appear amongst them. I would NEVER choose the company for any service, business or residential.",0

Now TV are as good as fraudulent. They make it notoriously difficult to cancel subscription payments and auto renew passes without consent. To delete your card details you have to do so through live chat which is hidden in the jungle of their website and is often 'disconnected' at the time you wish to ask for a refund or when you want to delete your details. I would advise not putting your card details up on this website if you want to avoid meaningless hours when you do want to stop paying for their monthly passes.,0
Bought a Kenwood fridge freezer from Currys. Nice item. Bought the knowhow 5 year warranty which seemed a bargain at ¬£149.99.

Very poor customer service. An item went faulty just out of warranty. An engineer informed me it was a manufacturers fault and under sale of goods act the retailer should still fix it. Very didn‚Äôt want to know and don‚Äôt even have an email address to contact them on. I was informed because I hadn‚Äôt been on my account they had deleted the order so there is nothing they can do.

"Utter rubbish and a liability.
I bought tw sims from Virginmobile through Carphone Warehouse, one was defective and the other unsuitable.
I went back to Carphone Warehouse the next day and both Carphone Warehouse and VirginMobile refused to put the problem right so both accounts were closed in store and I was given printed proof of closure.
VirginMoibile continued to bill me for these closed accounts for another two months and then passed my accounts the a debt collection agency despite several phone calls.
Six months later both Carphone Warehouse and virginMedia are maintaining bad debt records on my credit file which has already stopped me getting an overdraft to pay for my car insurance and fuel for the next two weeks which is going to cost me my job.",0
"I know it claims attention by the low prices but I tell you honestly don't fall on the same trap as I. 5 months later my laptop failed with only daily usage, I bought the highest spec, spent 4k and when I called them up to get it fixed they told me that they do not offer the option of trying to save your files, so I would lose more than 1 TB of work files, it shows how the company don't give a f. About its customers. Their policy is to only re install the software and that's it.
Go with a big trustful brand that does the job properly.
Not to mention that the first laptop I got from them arrived with problems already, so I had to send it back and a different model was sent instead, who also wasn't very reliable as you can see.
Customer service and a lack of effort or knowledge seems to be the main issues here.
Even had being told by them straight away that my hard disk was broken, I managed myself to make it work again, it looks like they are not doing a very good job when setting the computers systems so the thing keeps showing a few problems from time to time depending on your usage.",0
"British Telecom accept sign up for contracts via telephone conversation. If you want to cancel at anytime they will not accept cancellation in the same way. They also withhold that fact and continue taking payments from your bank. Even if you can prove no use of the service they can justify keeping the money they have taken as the service is provided weather used or not. They are protected by the ombudsman who supports that position. Anyone can fall into the trap of having your direct debit continued for me it was ¬£1,700 they took without my knowledge. To add insult to injury they will then add cancellation fees and if not paid they will chase you through debt collection agencies. Ruining your credit rating as well as stealing your money. The reason I cancelled with them? Simply that once you start your contract even when your equipment becomes outdated and breaks down they will only replace it with the same model that is not fully functioning due to system upgrades. Once your equipment starts to go wrong they will not supply the latest tech equipment to existing customers only to new ones for free.",0

I sent SEVERAL emails and messages to them on social media including photos of my iPads condition and I have been completely ignored. Disgusting.

In short if you have an elderly person that is reliant on their landline - do not touch Shell Broadband with a barge pole.

"Hi:

I have had a problem with my order with Vodafone. I ordered a Next day delivery home broadband last week, it was meant to be delivered on Wednesday but wasn‚Äôt.

Then they said it will be delivered Thursday for definite. I waited all day at home, didn‚Äôt go to my job, they said it would be delivered for sure, it wasn‚Äôt. They sent me a text saying we missed you- but they didn‚Äôt even come to my house I have waited all day at home there were 3 of us just sat here staring and waiting for them to come.

I even sent my brother to wait at the front door for them. They never came.


Then on call they promised me that no matter what happens they will deliver to me on Friday, that never happened. Then they said by Friday evening they will definitely deliver to a newsagent pick up point near me. That also didn‚Äôt happen.


Then they said no matter what happens they 100% confirm and will ensure it is delivered to me today on Saturday. Today also they didn‚Äôt deliver. I‚Äôve been waiting 4-5 days now.


It‚Äôs been absolutely ridiculous as I am without Internet. If I knew this was an issue I would have organised for another provider. It is the worst customer service I have received. I have spent ¬£50 on extra data on my mobile since the last 4 days only. And on top of that on Wednesday and Thursday I lost on ¬£95 income per day as I didn‚Äôt go to work on those days as I was waiting at home for delivery. Couldn‚Äôt even work from home as I don‚Äôt have Internet. This is a cost to me of over ¬£250 for no fault of mine!!!!

I asked what I can do - they said cancel, and then charged me ¬£300 for it. I asked to keep my BT Sports package active but they disconnected it AND kept charging me for it.

Stupidly I didn't take photos before sending. I've asked for evidence. I'm not holding my breath for a successful outcome to this and will never use Mazuma again. One of life's lessons learned.",0
"They clearly don't care about customers, if they did they would read these reviews and do something about it,m for me to even go into detail about how bad this customer service has been I really don't know how to do it, all I can say is please don't lock yourself up with this business they truly are horrendous at every level. They have the worst customer service out of any business I've ever been associated with.",0
"We placed an order on the 12th April, we have made contact twice, each time the order has been reordered, to now find out that yet again because of a glitch our order has gone missing. The call centres are unhelpful, and it's obvious BT doesn't care much for its customer. I get the impression they're just to big to care",0
"To call this a telecommunications company is laughable.

There is no communication between staff and customers or staff with other staff. Placed an order for a TV package 11 days ago. Nothing has happened. The order was apparently cancelled in error.

Nothing but nonsense from them since then.

Spent literally hours on the phone to be passed from one call handler to another and repeated the story so many times, I could now tell it in my sleep. How can they treat customers this way?",0
"I ordered an oven on a Wednesday and it arrived early on the Saturday. The door was smashed and reported within the hour, the advisor making not of all this. By the following Tuesday evening I was told a replacement couldn't be sent until the supplier knew what was wrong with the oven, despite several calls to explain the damage. On the Wednesday I recieved a text ""congratulating"" me that my new oven was on the way quickly followed by a phone call telling me it wasn't and what could they do to help??? For example, a discount on a broken oven days before Christmas?",0
I star to much for this shower. Can't send rubbish back to them as you can't trust them CUSTOMER SERVICE impossible to contact NEVER BUY or grief comes your way,0
"I sent a letter to Virgin Media to give notice that I was moving house, to an area they do not serve, along with proof. They continued to bill me for a month after I had moved, despite the timely notice, and then sent in debt collectors. It turns out that they do not accept letters! You have to use their irritating (and difficult to navigate) on line chat system, which leaves no paper trail. Companies are legally required to accept post sent to their registered office!",0
"Terrible from the off. Signed up to a new bundle and the website made it appear that I could choose any day for the install. Selected a date that coincided with the end of my old provider‚Äôs deal. I then got an email to say there were no engineers available until a week after that. Spent over an hour on the phone trying to get an explanation as to why I was able to book a slot in the first place but never got an answer. I was told I would be able to self install and they would send an engineer to check the connections. The engineer turned up, told us a self-install is not possible and left with no further advice given. It now looks like I will have to spend even longer on the phone trying to sort this mess out, and even longer waiting for the installation. This is a nightmare given we work from home. If I could cancel and never have to deal with these absolute cowboys I would. Avoid if you have any choice!",0
"I would rate zero stars if this were possible. I sent off my iPhone 13 Pro Max, original offer was ¬£560 I believe the revised offer from Mazuma was ¬£190 claiming there was an issue with the camera. My phone was only one year old and in excellent condition so I knew this could not be true. I rejected the offer and traded in directly to Apple for ¬£550! Mazuma‚Äôs behaviour feels very dishonest and deceitful and I could not recommend less. Please review your deceptive pricing model Mazuma Mobile.",0
The so-called online chat (Tobi) is worse than useless and indications are the each agent is handling multiple 'chats' at the same time. They do not understand very simple queries and ask for the same details many times. It seems impossible to actually talk to anyone unless you want to place an order. After sales service deserves a zero rating,0
"I sent off a Google Pixel 6 Pro in immaculate condition(not one single scratch or scuff) and have been told it is covered in scratches so needs to be repriced.

Unlucky for these disgusting thieves, I have video evidence that my phone was sent off in perfect condition. I will be taking this all the way to court.

Do not bother using this company. It is a massive scam. They will damage your property and lie about its state.",0
"All the reviews tells all about this company! When i noticed the roaming changes i made online chat with 3 while they set up spending cap without my permission also they put my other card to unlimited cap what it was set to 10 pounds. They knew im abroad already...i was lucky because i checked in my app so only a few days extra charges made already. Im a 11 years honest costumer have 4 sim cards with them but now they lost me as i can see many of costumer's decided to leave. Hope you are going to loose all of your costumer's and this company facing with hard times thanks for this poor and shameless service!
Dont forget that we have options but u dont! We dont need you but you need us!!!
So i just want to say to you all dont use them and if you can just leave as others say there is a lot more better options out there! Even i paid for the 5 pounds fee i couldn't use my phone to make and receive calls. Very disappointed about this service!!!",0

"I ordered an iPhone from Curry's at the end of December, I received my confirmation on 04th January, they said they would be sending me the parcel. Waited for two days, message came saying the parcel had been delayed, waited another day. Rang up Curry's to ask what was going on. They said it was up to the DPD company. Check on DPD website and it showed that the item had gone back to Curry's. I rang Curry's up again the next day, the lady was polite, she ordered me another phone and said the previous one was lost in the warehouse. She said it was next day delivery. I received a confirmation email. The next day, the order has a message: ""Driver cannot find your door"" I've never heard of a more stupid thing from a delivery service in my life. How is it all other delivers arrive but this one cannot find my DOOR? Rang up Curry's again, gave them hell, trying to find out where the hell my parcel was. The put me on hold, come back after 5 mins and say: ""Oh that one is also lost"" I asked for my money back straight away and the answer the attendant Matt gave me was: ""If you raise a complaint or ask for a refund now it will only make the process longer, you will receive your refund in a week"". What a place of lies and stupidity. Never buy from Curry's if you want something, they do not deserve your good money, give it to someone else who actually cares about their customers. To Curry's, I hope you get messed around like how you messed me around.",0
"I had a terrible experience with my trade in. I had upgraded my plan and ordered a new phone without any issues. Also arranged to trade in my old phone. It was supposed to be very easy process where I either drop my phone at their shop or use the prepaid package provided by Vodafone. First i was told by the shop that actually can't leave the phone there, then I received a wrong package and at that point the deadline was approaching. I got sent another package post the deadline and assured that this won't be an issue as it was their mistake. I returned my phone back with the second package to only received it back a week later in my house without any explanation or note. After another 3 hours on the phone it turned out the team has done another mistake when returning my phone and i was asked to do a second trade-in and was sent a 3rd package. I sent my phone again and now it has been more than 3 weeks and i haven't heard anything back. I contacted client service multiple times and everytime i am told about my first trade in and how it was my fault that it wasn't received on time. They keep leaving notes about the issue but everytime i contact client service i need to start all over again explaining the whole story. It looks like they have lost the phone which costs ¬£450 and don't want to admit it and trying to blame me for the mess. Services is very polite, and every single person assures me this will be sorted but 3 months later and more than 10 hours spent on the phone and more over chat nothing has been resolved. In the meantime the price of my old phone is keep going down and not even mentioning the frustration and time lost over such a simple thing. I wouldn't recommend Vodafone and would def change my provider as soon as my contract expires. Do not do a trade in with them at any cost!!!",0
"My current broadband contract expires in a few weeks, looking around Now TV broadband was ¬£10 cheaper per month and offered free unlimited calls. I decided to switch and did so on line only to have a message come back to say ""somethings not right, were sorry that didnt go to plan"". Following their advice I called the number shown, after spending some 10 minutes chatting to an advisor I was told that my local ""green box"" did not have any Now Broadband capacity so they were unable to offer me their service.

Should have stated in their sales pitch that ""we may be able to offer you broadband depending on where you live"". Seems SKY have the monopoly on my local box.

Complete waste of my time and theirs. Really reluctant to offer Sky my business again as they now want to charge me ¬£33 per month whilst new subscribers get the same service for ¬£28 per month.

Welcome to ripoff Britain again.",0
"In May I bought 2 washing machines, 2 dryers and a dishwasher all with an extended 5 year cover.
Last week one washer failed, I called the knowhow team and a repair was booked for Monday the 6th. I took the day off from my work and no one turned up. I received a txt saying that a 3rd party company was doing my repair and to ignore any dates given by knowhow. So I lost a days work. The repair was the booked in for today with the assurance that an engineer would txt the evening before to confirm time so I didn't have to take another day off work. No txt received so again another day lost. These days cost more than the machine. I have not now got a date for a repair and have been without my product for weeks.
Unprofessional from the start to book 2 dates, not turn up for either and then say its not our fault as we have subbed out the work. I have a contract with your company not a 3rd party sub company.
Would not recommend and would not use again, when do I get my goods fixed and how much more time and more importantly money is this going to cost me? When do you take responsibility an honour times given",0
"Very disappointed with PC Specialist. Spent ¬£1500 on a gaming laptop for my Son for his birthday present on 2nd January 2020 which was dispatched December 19.
In March 22 it stopped working so just over 2 years from purchase. Part of the warranty remained which was only labour. The parts were only covered for one year. I sent the laptop back which was diagnosed with motherboard failure and new battery and a repair cost of ¬£869!
Just be mindful of the warranty if you are considering this company. I am more concerned that a ¬£1500 laptop did not last more than two years and they hid behind the warranty terms of which was partly still active rather than protect their brand so I cannot recommend.",0
"I will never use Vodafone again or recommend. They made a fault on my account and put me in false arrears, it took me 7 weeks of fighting to get my money back stop being harassed by debt collectors!!! They damaged my credit rating by 200, said sorry but we cant fix this even though it is our fault.

Beware!!!!!!",0
Please don‚Äôt buy anything from this company they‚Äôll jus take your money and keep on making you wait jus chatting rubbish every time. So unprofessional reviews are there for a reason so save your money please.,0

Now after loads of emails, all excuses on their part they say it‚Äôs because of Covid19 but I‚Äôve ordered from a lot of company‚Äôs during this time all hassle free.

Why when you contact me saying we have cut you off. We understand you may be struggling with the payment. Then you say screw you we will add another late payment of ¬£5. Pls contact us to talk about your account go on to our website. Low and behold you cant as you have cut me off. Disgraceful service from a horrible company. Going to be leaving for ee. Vodafone. And why is it when you go on to live chat it always takes about an hour for customer service to solve your issue they make you wait for about 5/10 minutes before they get back after asking you a question last time it took over 40 minutes to get past security shocking I have kept quiet for to long with companys who don't give a s##t about looking after the people who pay your wages,0

A totally abysmal ‚Äúservice‚Äù during a bereavement where an uncle had died. I tried to change some details on a bill to another relative to take ownership of the line and then get the bill from my uncle frozen. It was for Probate to pay from his estate. However after several calls and emails all I got was I needed to pay the bill regardless and there was no real show of empathy or care. It was also suggested if the bill was not paid immediately the case would be referred to dept collection agency. Utter tosh!!! We will be changing to another company ASAP. BT are in my opinion just greedy and uncaring bunch.,0
"The on going saga continues, we have bt internet and a land phone line as our mobiles do not receive a signal where we live so I told bt that they must contact us on our landline whilst dealing with our complaint, guess what all calls over the past days have been made to the mobile which doesn‚Äôt work ! Including Wi-Fi calling because the internet is playing up. You couldn‚Äôt make this ridiculous amount of incompetence up !!!!",0

"Purchased a ninja air fryer damaged. Returned for refund, called after 14days for refund. They have not even acknowledged the product was returned forget about refund.

Genuinely the worst company I have ever dealt with for anything! From the phone consultants to the engineers absolutely awful service. Rescheduled my appointment 4 times had to wait 2 weeks to finally get someone to come and install my internet to then be there for 2 minutes and say he can‚Äôt do it and leave. Was then promised a loss of service by a manager at ¬£8.40 per day for the terrible customer service to then be told by another manager I‚Äôm not getting nothing. A month later still have not got anything sorted and have been told I‚Äôd have to wait At least another 3 weeks to get my internet up and running so obviously I just told them to cancel everything as how bad the whole experience with Virgin has been to then be charged for a service for the month that I haven‚Äôt even been able to use or see if it‚Äôs any good or not the router is still in a cardboard box. Honestly the whole company should be shut down I can‚Äôt believe that Virgin are aloud to carry on like this and reading other reviews and speaking to other people about them it‚Äôs obvious this is just how they operate. Only reason I opted to try with Virgin is because of the Name and Stature of the company which I thought because of that it will be a premium service but I can‚Äôt stress how poor this company‚Äôs customer service is and to top it all off they‚Äôve actually scammed me out of money aswell charged me for a months service that‚Äôs I haven‚Äôt had and to being told I‚Äôd get my money back and getting compensation for the loss of service and poor customer service to then being told by someone else I‚Äôm not getting nothing back I‚Äôve been ripped off.

"NEW DODGY SIMCARDS!.....READ ON. EE DENY THERE ISNT A PROBLEM
NEW DODGY SIMCARDS!.....READ ON.
After having problems with my signal on my samsung Galaxy A71 recently....i contacted EE/BT customer services.
They sent out a new sim, to rectify the problem, tried everything, reset too defaults etc. Would not work.
Then i was told to send it in for repair.

Deadlock!
i asked them to replace it! no deal came the reply from a smug manager.

So then i took another EE sim from my contract tablet, inserted into phone, and hey presto it worked.

An EE tech support guy was on my landline as i did this,
He said, were having problems with the new sims not registering on the networks.
And all EE staff had been emailed as regards this.
His remedy was to send me a sim card of the old variety.
He also said they only had 180,000 off the old sims left in stock.

I just went to raise a complaint withh EE customer services as regards this whole sorry experience.
There response was pure fabrication, denying everything!
But ive recorded all there calls...

Right from the off i suspected a problem with my phone, little did i realise that all EE staff have known about this problem! but continued to send me on a wild goose chase.

A measly offer off ¬£ 30 quid was made, denying conversation with IT guy ever took place!

What a scummy underhanded, devious company EE have turned into...

Remember people, if your new sim aint registering, its not your phone thats broken! Its EE faulty sims..

Next stop, trading standards!
please spread the word about the faulty sims!
Otherwise you may get sent on a wild goose chase by a very dishonest 4 EE customer service reps.

"Argos live chat totally useless would not put myself through to a manager as my complaint was re yodel not delivering to door and had to go and collect I live in high rise but that should not make any difference as I paid for services that should be door to door, well that's what I thought was delivery, not part delivery and yet we pay these louts there wages by shopping with argos, let alone stinking couriers wages. Argos come across as if they don't care and nonchelulent. This company seems to just take and when there is a problem do not want to rectify despite Argos stating they should deliver to door and another staff comes out with a total different meaning to delivery as if they don't feel safe they won't come in to high rise, the guy is a bloke even Argos female delivery drivers deliver to do on night time.

Ordered a mobile phone contract on 3/2/20. Next day 4/2/20 received an email to phone them so I called them and they did my credit search with O2. Credit check passed and been told that it will be delivered the next day. Ok next day on 5/2/20 got an email that order has been cancelled becoz internal checks failed I phoned them and the manager said he will email the internal check dep if they can overturn the decision. On 7/2/20 got a phone call from a manager that we will deliver the phone but I‚Äôll have to go to the store to provide 2 forms of photo ID. On 8/2/20 went to the store with IDs at 6pm and the store guy said he can‚Äôt accept it because internal check dep is closed now so come tomorrow. On 9/2/20 I was at work so couldn‚Äôt go to the store so I sent my husband with IDs but they didn‚Äôt accept it from him and said I have to be there. on 10/2/20 we both went again to the store and now they said they only keep order open for 7 days so that order is cancelled. So we decided to buy the phone deal from the store but now they don‚Äôt have it in stock. They promised to get it from another store by next week. Ok week after I received a phone call that it will take another 1 week. So finally after 2 week on Saturday we went to the store with IDs but the girl who promised was off sick so the other girl asked us to come on Sunday. Ok now Sunday we went again and now she said that she has the phone for us but that O2 deal isn‚Äôt available anymore and the new deal is costing me ¬£300 more than the one I ordered. So finally after 5 visits of the store and waiting nearly a month I didn‚Äôt get the phone. Is this some kind of a joke? Getting a house mortgage wasn‚Äôt this difficult.,0

I have had to contact them 4 times so far and have been lied to on two of those occasions.

On my third contact I was told the product wasn't in stock, they were expecting a delivery in a few days and it would be send out then. After the call I checked online and found there was stock available.

After waiting a few more weeks for my replacement I contacted them again to be told the same lie - no stock. I told them there was stock online, there response was that there was only one left and it was faulty. So either she's lying or Currys are knowingly selling faulty goods on their website? Tbh neither would surprise me.

I asked for a refund instead, she agreed to do that and promised to send an email confirming straight after our chat. The email and refund have never arrived.

They have just sent me an email saying a replacement is on it's way so I'm guessing the promise of a refund was a lie as well as well.

The email I just received with contains tracking links for the original order back in April with a photo of it on my doorstep so I guess I'll be contacting them for 5th time. Probably to be lied to again.

Note: if you're doing an online chat, I recommend taking a copy of the conversation yourself, don't rely on the 'email transcript' functionality as that doesn't work either.

Currys management, you need to get control of your contact centre. I suspect you already know they are terrible and that it's a difficult thing to change. Whilst you work on that problem, maybe ask them to drop the over-the-top pretend empathy and vacuous platitudes.",0
"NowTV billed me nearly ¬£70. This was unauthorised. I have spent months trying to get clarity on what happened and my money back. I received a partial (about 30%) refund but since then they have been obstructive, dismissive and have breached the GDPR by not providing information I requested and then completely ignoring my request that their Data Protection Officer review my case.

Their help forum shows many situations like mine and I've been documenting my case there - community (dot) nowtv (dot) com under the subject ""Billing problems - unauthorised debits""

I an now taking a complaint to the Information Commissioner and have been directed by NowTV to CISAS as 'there is nothing more we can do'.

Be careful, very careful, if you use NowTV as their customer 'service' is abysmal and they clearly are not concerned if they do not comply with the GDPR!",0

Along with quite a few others yesterday I placed an order for iPhone 14 looks like no orders were either accepted or fulfilled and you used either cancelled due to stock issues or cancelled due to not being accepted by network funny never had a problem before and already have a three contract too rather than using this as an excuse your customers would rather you actually told the truth and admit it was an error on the site now people are being left with a negative mark on their credit because of this you just need tolook at all the 1 star reviews for order of iPhone 14 yesterday to see,0
"I wish i could give Zero stars!

Honestly sort it out! Its 2022
Im off to EE! They seem to be able to get it right. And id advise everyone else too",0
"I wish I could give them 0 stars.

Worst service imaginable. I have had my services mysteriously cancelled 3 times and each time they tell me a 3rd party accidentally put my address down as taking over the line.

Without contacting me, the account holder, they automatically set it to close (with exit fees) without my consent.

To make it more hilarious they require me to provide a pin to access my account but apparently a random person can close a line without a check.

After the 3rd time this happened with no apologies I put an official complaint in. Within 2 hours I receive an email saying the complaint had been resolved. If this was wrong I was instructed to call the genetic BT number which has no option to talk about complaints.

They don't care about customers. They know they can get away with the worst customer service in the United Kingdom because they have a monopoly on the lines.

I can't wait for my contract to end and never use this dodgy company again. I get better service from my local takeaway.",0
"My order was placed within the guaranteed Christmas delivery period and I was given a delivery date of 19th - 22nd December.  Within a few days I received an email stating my order had been dispatched and would be delivered between 29th Dec and 2nd Jan - days after Christmas! I contacted the online customer services immediately and the advisor ensured me that this was an error and that my order would arrive in time for Christmas, especially as I had placed my order by the Christmas cut off deadline.  Sadly this was not the case.  My 11 year old daughter was left with no gift to give her grandparents on Christmas day. If this wasn't bad enough, I then recieved an email offering 40% of any orders placed! So not only was I left with no order, I had to pay full price for a product that did not arrive until after Christmas and I could have saved at least 40% and received it at the same time! 

Snapfish failed to deliver a service which was guaranteed twice to me and I was left waiting and wondering if my order would even arrive in 2022! 

I emailed Snapfish on Boxing Day, airing my grievances and am still awaiting a reply.

My advice would be, shop elsewhere if you need the product by a certain date! Unreliable service, which left me highly disappointed; although to be fair the actually product was of great quality.",0
"After being a customer for more than 14 years, I have been overcharged almost three times what it's meant o be for my sim only card, even tho it was agreed a lower rate, i have been on the phone with their customer service 3 time and each time them telling me its sorted but nothing changed and continuously being charged the higher amount- just ridicules.",0
"Opening description

I have been a customer of BT for many years paying the same money and I thought id contact BT to see what deal they could make , The offer to me was to increase the speed to 75 mg (not peak speed but regular speed) I would be provided with 3 mesh disks to replace the existing 3 disks I have (I have white ones BT contact said would be compatible but are not ) he also offered free landline /mobile calls from my landline phone
When the order came in they only provided 1 disk, (its the only amount they can supply with order) the speed was only 60 mg guaranteed (they would have known this at the time of offer) and there were no free calls for my landline no such deal exists with bt
I consider this to be very a underhand way of behaving, luckily my phone recorded this offer, the rep would have known the maximum speed I could get and how many disks would be provided and that he wasn't going to provide any free calls at all !!!!!!!
I expect this level of service from some back street dealers not BT, I wrote a letter of complaint at 9.58 and complaint was closed at 10.12 with the comment ""Unfortunately, there was no resolution"" by all means use BT but remember..........they don't always tell the truth, GET ANY OFFER BY BT CONFIRMED BY EMAIL BEFORE AGREEMENT",0

"Order a new cooker and also paid for installation with the old cooker being taken away. New cooker was delivered and I was told by the delivery drivers that installation would be completed by a different team - they did not show up. Three months later and after several complaints to Currys I arranged for an independant engineer to fit the gas cooker. Currys then e-mailed me out of the blue with a date to collect and return the new cooker. 6 months on and I have still not had my installation charge refunded or any compensation from Currys as to why their delivery team effectively lied.
Currys have now responded and said to get in touch if I still need help with an installation - still no comment about the two complaints I raised - refund of installation charge and why their drivers lied. Says it all really",0
Ordered on the 26th Sept for delivery on the 28th Sept no show. So emailed on the 29th Sept received an email back on the 30th Sept saying out of stock and back in stock on the 7th Oct not very happy but said I would wait no show again rung up and asked when I would be receiving chainsaw on the 10th Oct.Told next day no show emailed on the 11th Oct and asked for a delivery date just said I would know when they send an email with tracking.

"I've been a BT customer for 6 years. When I called up to cancel my services because I found a cheaper deal elsewhere, I was first put into contact with a lady who used this as an opportunity to sell me a new contract. While I appreciate sales, she gave me a price which I asked her to hold for 24hrs when before I knew it, I had new paperwork for a new contract for 24 months delivered via email.

When the following day I tried to exercise my cooling off period for a contract I never agreed to. Upon doing this, I was informed that my contract couldn't be cancelled and I'd need to set something up with another supplier who will then take up the line. He first walked me through why BT is better though, which is fine, I get thats their job, but he started talking about how long it would take an engineer visit to come to us and he cited 2 days, but the last time I had an issue - in October this year, it took 18 days for an engineer to visit.

From this, the representative then got very angry and started shouting down the phone about how I was lying and if I wanted the truth, I could just google it - completely disregarding my own experience.

I'm so disappointed that this is how my custom with BT ends, but I will not be going out of my way to use them again.",0

"Before my holiday I topped up my pay as you go with credit. After using the phone the next day when I tried to call I found I could not nor could I be contacted/receive texts. I supposed at the time that this was due to having used all my credit and not being in the UK.
Upon returning to the UK I topped up via the web but still the phone did not work. When I contacted Three via the chat I was informed that there had been ""suspected fraud"" on my account, they were happy enough to take my credit though! Since then I've been in contact with Three several times via the chat & received a call after filling in the online complaint form with no resolution nor an adequate explanation.
I just want my credit returned and for them to issue the PAC number so I can take my business elsewhere.
Three are now insisting I have to provide them with photographic evidence to progress the issue. My point is I was left abroad with a phone that I could not receive calls on or even two-factor authentication codes and you couldn't even be bothered to contact me to let me know! No text, no call, no email, nothing... I was blocked from logging onto the app or web site. Upon my return you were happy enough to take my top-up for this supposedly fraudulent account. Now you think I'm going to trust you with additional sensitive, personal information like my drivers licence or passport so I can get my own money back & leave your organisation!?",0
"The teamknowhow the call support service was worst, I have ever experienced in my life. The person over the phone was extremely rude and uncooperative.

"Conned by the sales person in the Three shop that sold me a contract that I did not agree to. We agreed an upgrade and a new deal. Went through with what I will be paying and agreed on upping the up front costs to bring the contract down. But he disappeared back stores for ages and came back with the paperwork for me to sign. He also appologised and gave me a load of goodies and said, don't worry these are all yours for waiting so long. I didn't even ask for them. But little did I know there was another hidden contract and a phone insurance I was not informed of, or even asked if I wanted, that I've only just found out I've signed. And to make matters worse he charged for all the items he said we're free. And the clever thing he did was put the reciept in the bag with the so called free items. So I didnt have chance to check it. I am fuming.
Contracts have now been cancelled. And I have reported this said person and now looking to sue for loss of up front payment which I have subsequently lost. I wonder who else he's done this to. Do not go to this shop at all costs",0

As they were unable to supply the roater to my address ,they apologised and disconnected me since August!!
While talking I found that he is from the lotality team and he knows that my account is disconnected !!
So ,why are you talking to me !!
Why am I still on your contact list !!
Why are you sending bills!!
Why do you close complaints autonomously without investigating or addressing the other party!!
Why your system is not updated !!
Why you have rude and psychopath customer service!!
I wish you find out why you are rated 1 star by 45% of ppl
This should ring a bell to whom is responsible and to talk talk .
Just an advice ,
If you are in contact or a customer in this company,pls keep record of everything ,chats,emails ,phone calls and sms in a saved folder as they have control over it after sending it !!
And do not trust there words everything should be documented .",0
What a joke of a company. Since I was moved to Shell at the beginning of 2022 they have always charged me on an estimated basis even though I have been submitting meter readings every month without fail.

"Terrible terrible terrible mobile company. Athetic roaming plans. Lost my phone abroad, spent 60 minutes on an international vcall trying to get through to an operator, subjected to the torture of the world most Godawful high pitched screaming passed off as music. Needles to say no operator. Tried online,a r**arded chatbot they've named Tobi started to torture me. When I got through to an agent it was evident they were dealing with MANY customers at the same time. Talk about penny pinchers! Returned to UK, went to a store to be told, since my contract doesn't end for another 20 days, I'll have to pay extra to UPGRADE. Still waiting for the replacement sim I ordered from abroad more than two weeks ago. THEN some r**ard thought its a good idea to try and sell me broadband...Guess what I told them to go and do to themselves? Avoid at all cost this pathetic excuse of a company! No sense of customer service, and somewhere there is an idiot who has implemented these changes thinking they're a great business strategist. Guess I am not going to be a part of that strategy's plan to fleece customers.

"Almost 5 months ago, I ordered an iPhone from Carphone Warehouse (on a 24 month contract with ID Mobile worth approximately ¬£600). DPD (Birmingham) failed to deliver my iPhone order, but insisted that I had received it despite not having any photographic evidence or any GPS data (apparently their sat nav was ‚Äúnot working‚Äù at the time). I‚Äôve been trying to cancel the agreement ever since but Carphone Warehouse has consistently fobbed me off, lied to me and ignored my complaint letters.

On Day 57 after the iPhone was due to be delivered, DPD ‚Äúfound‚Äù some photographic ‚Äúproof of delivery‚Äù. However, the house in the photograph is not mine. The woman in the photograph is not me. All the ‚Äúproof of delivery‚Äù evidence actually does is prove that delivery was NOT to me. And yet, I still can‚Äôt get this contract cancelled. This would be laughable if ID Mobile were not chasing me with debt collectors.

I spent another 49 minutes on the phone with Carphone Warehouse customer services today, yet again trying to fight my corner. Despite the total lack of evidence for delivery, I was still unable to cancel the agreement. Carphone Warehouse are still believing every lie that DPD feeds them. I was promised a ‚Äúcall back in 15 minutes‚Äù from a manager. Needless to say, I‚Äôm still waiting.

Ordered a lens cap (I think). Once I had paid for it a box appeared on the right side telling me there was a problem and to pay again! I didn't bother and decided to wait for an email just in case I ended up paying twice. 10 minutes later the fraud team phoned from my bank listing suspicious activity. Gladly there was none and the problem of it not going through properly must have done that. Nothing wrong my end - there was plenty in my account. Never again.,0

"We like to use a 'bricks and mortar' shop whenever possible, rather than buy online. We've used the Basildon store a few times without a major issue, although theres always a long wait to get served. Lots of staff in store...looking busy doing nothing. Anyway, we had seen a product we like and when we went to pay we was told the item would be delivered to the store within 3-5 days. Not a problem, but would have rather been told before it got to the payment stage. We was told the item would be delivered to the store by the 28th Dec. We received an email from Currys with the delivery details and a YODEL tracking number. The 28th came and went. No sign of the item. We had been tracking the item via the number provided and each day it had 'arrived at your local depot'. not once but twice. The item had allegedly been attempted to be delivered to the store at quarter to one in the afternoon but 'premises was closed'. We know for a fact the shop was open. A week later it was still sat in Yodels depot. We contacted Currys customer services who were useless. They told us exactly what we knew from the tracking number. We decided to go back to the Basildon store and see if they could help more. Another sales assistant took our details and proceeded to tell us what we already knew about the tracking. The following day the item was still sat in Yodels depot. We went back into the store and asked to speak to the manager, to see if they could help and chase up the parcel. We showed the manager all the ordering details and all the tracking details (including the fact the item had been sitting in Yodels depot for over a week without moving). We told them that we appreciate they have no control over the courier service but as it is the courier service THEY are using, maybe they would be able to chase it up. The manager told us, WE had to contact Yodel again to chase it up. She told us we could cancel the item and get a refund if we wanted. She never even offered to reorder a replacement. They had got our money and had no interest in helping us any further.",0

Update: Thanks for the reply Ankita, but any update to your network in the UK is not going to improve this issue. The problem is with the data share agreement you have with International networks. At the moment the throttling of data is too severe. Whilst I don't expect to have quite the same speed as at home, it needs to be at least usable (within a fair usage policy).",0

Someone opened an account in his name !!!
Three have not done anything at all to help and have not exhaused all avenues!!
They haven't exhausted one avenue !!!
Three have not advised, guided or helped my son at all !!!
6 months later he is still going round and round in circles with Three!!!
Three are the most incompetent, unhelpful, useless and diabolical company!!!
I will repeat DO NOT use them as a phone provider!!!",0
Bt is a disgrace being with them your 7 years no fibre terrible internet doing nothing to help staff less than helpful should be ashamed as a large company taking peoples money for a rubbish service,0
Looking or a Zero star or a - minus star. Ordered a phone which i needed urgently of which i infomred them. None received for 13 days. cancelled the order - no refund for the next 14 days. Up came the COVID excuse. Said they will pay before July 10th - passed - no refund. Taking to court now. This company should just shut down. They have been taken to trading standards in the past (2019). Will be taken again by me.,0
"Being a well know company I naively expected a honest and quick service and didn‚Äôt read the reviews. Wish I had I would have never had used them. My experience is they rip you off. I sent two phones over to them. Having fully inspecting the phones and comparing them against guidelines about what condition is accepted at each level I went about placing my sale. The 1st phone had been in a protective case from new which included the screen, only one slight mark on side of phone, which was caused by myself removing case, the mark being no more than 2mm. This was put under excellent category as per there guidelines and a price of ¬£85 offered and accepted. 2nd phone under good category as per there guidelines and ¬£110 offered and accepted. Phones sent on a Monday and email received on a Wednesday saying arrived. At that time so far so good and as advertised expecting say day payment. Oh no what a fool to believe that. Chased up the company the next day around 10am to be told that circumstances out of there control affect same day payment. The out of control was amount of phones they received over the weekend.??? Really this is now Thursday I‚Äôm ringing.!!! I was told that payment would be today and that they do two payment runs one at 12pm and one at 6pm. It was after 3.30pm I received an email titled Problem with order. And there we are original price reduced from combined 185 to 105. The reason being scratches on screen and marks on casing. They had already priced the phones with me entering the right condition grade so how come my one phone mysteriously developed scratches while they had it there end. It was then I looked at the reviews and boy most of the complaints where the company reducing prices because of scratches and then when you ask for phones back people saying it had taken weeks for them to be returned. I have had no choice but to take the very poor offer. I only hope this review will help others not to use this company.",0
"Ordered iPhone 14 Pro Max 5 weeks ago with delivery date stating ‚Äúby 8th October‚Äù.

It‚Äôs now 20th October and my phone still has not been dispatched. Serious stock issues ongoing and stating delivery dates they have no chance of meeting.

No emails or updates regarding stock so I‚Äôm just playing a waiting game at this point.",0
If there was a option of zero stars I would rate it zero stars big thumbs down for Argos I had placed an order for Xmas presents and the cost was 117.00 on the 23th of November there was an problem when I had placed my order and I never received a confirmation email and the money was pending in my bank and now we are on the 28th and I have still not received the money back and the items are starting to go out of stock I am very unhappy and disappointed as I had phoned Argos to find out more and only got an automated service to say it would take 5 days to go back in my bank this is unacceptable in these time and this has left me in severe hardship and debt you should have not taken the money,0
"I would give a zero if it was possible. Ordered a phone for next day delivery. Two weeks later and still no phone, only a SIM card was delivered. Endless calls trying to sort it out and still no resolution. The DD for the phone has also been taken. Dreadful service and useless assistance to resolve the matter provided.",0
This is for any customer wishing to use Carphone warehouse services. I bought the latest iPhone package with latest iPhone and Vodafone contract. I changed my mind and cancelled the next day and never received the phone ! The upfront payment for the phone of ¬£350 was immediately debited but after almost 3 wks nothing has been refund and they also debited ¬£50 from Vodafone without any usage! Not customer service to solve over the phone! Worse service and would never recommend them to anyone,0
One week after Christmas and two weeks after ordering - still no parcel. I emailed customer service and have yet to receive a response.,0
"Delayed delivery and poor comms so I cancelled the order and bought one elsewhere.
Caravan club discount code used and MEMBERSHIP NUMBER PROVIDED WITH THE ORDER.",0
"I hope that everyone reading my message will never order from this rubbish delivery company.
I ordered from Nando‚Äôs for ¬£158 snd they never delivered my order.
They are telling the same story like to everyone that they cannot get in touch with you.
On top of that they are refusing to refund my money based on nothing apart trusting their thieves riders.",0
"All the staff were gathered together in a huddle. They were not have a staff meeting but all on their phones. I had to go over and ask for help as no one had approached me. A guy came over and asked what I wanted. I showed him what I wanted to buy and he got it out the cupboard and took me to the till, scanned the item and said that the card machine was ready. He then sat down.and carried on doing whatever it was in his phone looking a the Internet. The card machine took my payment and he gave me a receipt, still looking at his phone. The customer service I received was zero. Disgusting service. I won't be going back to the Sittingbourne store again. Also there was a set up so you could listen to the different type of WiFi speakers but none of them worked. When I queried this I was told to go to another store where their demo system might work. Disgraceful service allbround. I got the impression none if the staff wanted to be there.",0
In the past my score would be 5 stars. However I have currently been waiting 2 weeks for a decision on the value of a curry‚Äôs voucher in order to purchase a replacement tv as they were unable to repair it . When I rang to complain I was told they didn‚Äôt have any contact details on their system but a week earlier the person I spoke to confirmed my details with me !! Not sure what is happening at the moment but I will definitely be thinking twice about purchasing the support plan in the future. Very disgruntled customer.,0
¬£40 for next day delivery on a cooker!!! found same item on Marks Electrical for cheaper and delivery half price.,0
"they make u download the player also along with it which makes now tv more horrible and unfit to use. i am still stuck on first episode of GOT a s I am struggling with the now tv player. its not compatible, the sound is low quality and subtitles need to switched on agagin and again.i will not recommend this to anyone. now tv is worst tv player i ever seen.utter waste of time.",0
Sadly I trusted that giving my PAC code on Thursday would mean a seamless transfer from EE to O2 with my number. Having waited from Friday to Monday I finally called O2 who have had to start the process that I was told would be done by this company. I now have been charged for my new contract for the last 3 days but have not used it at all as still on my old phone and EE and therefore paying them.,0
"Absolutely awful!
Couldn't get a signal, when on a call I couldn't hear the other person or they couldn't hear me. I contacted three and they told me it would be best to end my contract and send the phone back. They took ¬£50+ from my account, then refused to give me a pac number. After 2 weeks I was finally given one. They've refused to refund me, they've decided to credit an account I no longer hold with them. I've had to contact citizens advice as this has now been an ongoing issue for 3 months!
Stay clear of three, customer service is awful, I've put in a complaint numerous times to be told ""we will get back to you"" and surprise surprise I don't heart anything! Don't waste your time!!!!",0
"The experience of buying a new device was good. Delivery was fast. But the customer service people are inept. They‚Äôre friendly and sound like they‚Äôre trying to help but I don‚Äôt think they know what they‚Äôre doing.
I closed my account and returned the device but they keep calling me! Each time it seems
to come as a surprise to them that I have closed my account.
Also it is hard to understand them - the line is so bad. Laggy, echoey etc. I know the call center is in India but for a telecommunications operator it‚Äôs not a good look.
Also I didn‚Äôt appreciate getting the hard sell from the retentions team when I wanted to close my account. It was patronising and frustrating.",0
"If I could give a zero star, I would. Internet stopped working a week ago and I have been on the phone daily. I keep getting told that an engineer will fix it as the fault is from the exchange. After 4 days, the WiFi came back on for about 30 minutes then went off. I was back on the phone the next day and miraculously the WiFi came back on for a few hours and now it's gone again. I tried to cancel my contract but was told it would incur an extra charge, however if the technical team can confirm that they cannot fix the fault then I can cancel for free. Well I guess that's why the ""fix"" the fault briefly so they can say they fixed it and I have to start the process all over again. At this point, I would happily pay to cancel my contract as this has been a terrible experience. I work from home and have had to pay to work in office spaces all week.",0
"Tried to cancel order but even after various
emails to customer support there was no reply. Wanted to cancel due to fact that delivery was suddenly 7-10 working days.
Delivery:
Calling card left at wrong address.",0
"If I could rate it lower I would. 2 weeks they have had my pc for repairs and I wouldn't mind that except that I have been promised callbacks, promised it was progressing, promised it was being handled only to find out 2 weeks in that not a single thing has been done with it. I am absolutely livid. I could have taken it locally and got it back in half the time. The only reason i sent it back is because it is in warranty but this whole fiasco has guaranteed I will never use them again.",0
"The store wasn't able to give me much information on the product that I Purchased, 2 x Apple Watch's, didn't advise on Christmas day I wouldn't be able to use them as I required a different charger (C3 adapter) to a normal USB for most Apple products - also didn't inform me that one of my sons iPhone 7 was compatible, with the above watch, over ¬£600 spent and absolutely ruined Christmas day. (¬£12. adapter) of which I would have happily and did buy two from a different store.",0
"Well done deliveroo, not. You lost a client of many years, that orders multiple times per week, oh wait, it seems you lost lots of clients. These clowns had the audacity to say that my a rider was on way to the restaurant but the outlet had already closed, this was verified with the establishment. Deliveroo then lied and said my order was on the way, it never was. They then further lied telling me my order was delivered, I have CCTV at my front door proving otherwise. They refused to refund me. Uninstalled this app quicker than i could ask why.

Delivered at
00:41
Friday.

But the establishment closed 1hour 41minutes before, so how is that possible? LOL.

"Disgraceful way to treat a pensioner. My Mother paid cover on her TV for 8 year and when it broke down they took it away for a week and then sent a replacement which was also faulty, she had to wait 1 month for the faulty replacement to be repaired, sat in all day on the saturday as they said it was going to be delivered but it did not show up. They eventually delivered it today without the stand, remote control or power socket, after several calls and about 1 hour we got through to someone who said she would now have to wait for the remote and power socket to be posted and they would have to book someone in to deliver the stand. She is 78 and I went round to find her in tears and her blood pressure is raised now. Absolute disgrace and terrible service trying to speak to the correct department is a trial and when you eventually get through to someone they pass you on to another department.",0
"BT are an absolute nightmare. I wish I had never had come into contact with them. I was convinced by one of their sales team to switch my services in March. They were supposed to install in two weeks. Since then there's been one problem after another including my order being cancelled for no reason, they have given me dates for installation over the phone, then a different date via email. They have confirmed dates and then denied it. It's now end of May 2022, I am now trying to cancel my order to end this nightmare but that is a problem. They told me my order was cancelled and I would get a confirmation email. I hadn't had anything 24 hours later so called to confirm they had canceled and my cancelation has not gone through. So in summary they won't install the services but also won't cancel the order. Stay away from BT for your own sanity!!",0
"If I could give 0 stars I would.
Firstly vodafone lied about an engineer slot being available at the beginning of September 2022, the engineer never arrived. No one in vodafone updated me, I had call daily for a week.
An engineer was then booked in without my knowing and I was on holiday. I then booked another appt which was also cancelled. 3 months later I finally get an installation but apparently no compensation is due for a delay of 3 months!!! absolutely appalling, avoid at all costs.",0
"Worst service, does not load even with high speed internet. They will subscribe you the passes (packages) without you even noticing and then they will take an automatic payment without even giving them the permission.",0
absolutely disgusted bought a tumble dryer had 4 repairs in 2 years opted for the replace told id receive a voucher for replacement still waiting after allowing the designated timeframe still nothing and now when you ring the two numbers you get cut off so no way of finding out when i will get the voucher not acceptable,0
I paid for instattion of new integrated appliance and removal of old one. Delivery drivers just dumped the fridge freezer and left saying they don't install integrated appliances. Thanks Argos you literally left me to sort it out. That's the last product I will ever buy from you. Dreadful experience!,0
"Useless.
I switched from Plusnet which was bad enough.....
I had no idea there were worse providers out there.
They have NO customer service whatsoever. They only get back to you if you contact them via the complaint option.
ATM I'm ""fighting"" with them over a renewal/upgrade of my current contract. I want to renew the contract online. Nope, not possible. I have to force myself through a call centre session where they'll probably try to sell more than I want, including fridge freezers and luxury mattresses....
I'll simply look for a new provider. After a month of trying to contact them, well, I could have spent the time upgrading and working rather than waiting for a response or sensible offer.
Why such comtempt for existing customers?",0
"Terrible company, engineer did not turn up the first time with no explanation. Only after spending hours trying to get hold of someone did I manage to schedule an appointment 1.5 weeks later. Then no landline which I rely on for business so another session talking to them to try to sort this out. Landline finally came on after another day and after getting no calls I found unbeknown to me they had changed the number and exchange! Initially they said no problem to give me my old number back then they changed the story completely and refused to change this back and said I had consented to this!!! Nowhere could i see where I was asked about this and I was never notified of the new number!
Update: I cancelled the service. This was another saga. After 2 lengthy phone calls on successive days I was told to return equipment to a Vodaphone shop Stafford). The shop told me they could not cancel the service and initially refused to accept the equipment. They also told me I should have been able to retain my old number! After some argument they agreed to take the equipment but would not give me a receipt. Not very helpful or polite.
I spent another 50 minutes on the phone and spoke to 3 different people to try to do cancel the service.
Basically the customer service is appalling at all levels and I would say beyond hope. Each time you speak to someone the story changes. No wonder Vodaphones share price is on a steady decline.",0
"Bought a home broadband deal with ‚Äúfree Amazon tablet‚Äù as part of the package as already a mobile customer.

Said they would deliver the code for tablet between 21-28 days (so you can't cancel broadband anymore) and it's been nearly 40 days and still no code.

Why promise what you can't deliver? I'll be cancelling my phone contract and filing a complaint",0
"A zero rating is what they deserve.
Do not take out a plan with Currys or Know How as their customer service and repair & protect insurance plan is not worth wasting a single penny on. Its useless.
4 months since engineer visited and we were told our Tumble Dryer cannot be repaired and my husband and I are still waiting to receive a voucher.
We are both in our 80s with health conditions and urgently need to replace the tumble dryer as we have damp in our house due to not being able to dry our washing. Currys Know How are aware of this but still keep fobbing us off.
We keep being asked to provide our details which we have done and continue to do numerous time. Each time we provide the details it takes Currys Know How 2 weeks to respond usually asking for the info again.
We have now been told the voucher was sent and they say there system states we have viewed the voucher but we have received nothing. I am assuming they have not sent it and are trying to get out of it or they have internal fraud and a staff member has pocketed the voucher or they have sent the voucher to someone else.
I have other items insured with Domestic & General and they repair or replace old for new within a couple of weeks. With Currys Know How its been 4 months and still waiting.",0

"I have had the unfortunate experience of being a Talk Talk customer and would warn anyone thinking of it to steer well clear of these absolute muppets.

I can't be bothered to go into all of the details. Suffice to say the broadband is glacially slow at best, when it worked. It cut out constantly. The customer service is attrocious. No way to email them. A telephone number which charges and takes forever t get throught to people who are unable to help and appear completely untrained. Not that that is their fault i'm sure, they just work for an awful company. Trying to leave Talk Talk is just as painful. Three months after the contact was ended they are trying to charge me for a router they have not given an address to return or sent a bag to return it in. Again, impossible to resolve as whenever you call they just tell you to wait 10 working days to receive it and it never comes.

Attrocious, avoid",0

I never received any email confirmation or anything... still waiting to get it ... it has been 4 days now since the first complaint! a joke!! so I have a lamp with no lampshade on it! I have tried to chat with them via facebook but it is a stupid AI that does not help at all. And clearly I can't trust Argos real people who lied to me twice!

Before buying off these, really consider when you want the items.
Service is the worst I have ever experienced.

EDIT:
Hi Chris, i spoke to the service team yesterday too who upgraded the delivery to early morning for me. She told me that if i hadnt had an expected delivery email by 6pm (yesterday) to call back to make sure things are going as planned. So at 6pm, i called back and was told again i would get an email and get delivery this morning. No email was forth coming, hence me calling again this morning and cancelling.",0
I am really disappointed in the dehumidifier. It does not seem to be working properly. The water tray has hardly any water in it despite being on for hours. The walls and windows are still wet after hours and the orange light is permanently on where the fan is. This is useless.,0
"These chancers came and took my 6 month old laptop for repair. What a joke from start to finish. After researching I‚Äôve found out it is a common problem with this brand of laptop but we were first told is was ‚Äòneglect‚Äô on our part and insurance didn‚Äôt cover it! They then charged us ¬£60 for the repair but after a week with no word we rang and were told that the first ¬£60 was actually for an ‚Äòassessment‚Äô and we had to pay a further ¬£60 for the actual repair! Needless to say we got a full refund but only after another week and stating consumer rights did they relent. I took the laptop to a local shop and guess what....they charged me ¬£8 for a replacement clip which was all it needed. I‚Äôll never use know how again, steer well clear.",0

Last I heard from them was 6 weeks ago, the returns manager was going to contact me. Silence since then and all my emails have gone unanswered.

Now I've got a faulty floor cleaner and a hole in my wallet.

I ordered an iPhone 7 from this company but it wasn‚Äôt dispatched after the agreed 11 working days . I then cancelled it and was told a refund would be processed within 14 working days.

"Shoddy from start to finish. Was quoted a decent price for my iPhone 8 only to have this drastically reduced when they reviewed it - this is despite the phone having no superficial damage.

Disgusting customer service and disgusting net work ever. I had enough with them. Being as three customers past 4years never had a good signal or good network.

Wouldn't give me a refund until I had the phone, wasn't travelling 2 hours back up to fetch a phone so asked order to be cancelled. Having to wait 14 days for bloody refund. Absolutely disgusting. Never ever will I shop with you again and I will advise anyone I know not to either. Quick enough to take money but getting it back takes ages.

Lo and behold - the app states that the food had been delivered at reception - so we spend 15 minutes wandering around looking for our food - which is nowhere ti be found. We demanded a refund and had to explain ourselves 3 times! It seems clear to me that the driver was either too thick to find reception, or too lazy to even try - he was certainly too lazy to phone us! We suspect he simply took the food home as it was probably the last drop of the day! That was my first time of using deliveroo and it will most certainly be the last time I use them!",0

"Talktalk does not have sufficient speed on the 28 pounds package and i decided to cancel within 30 days of installation wich i have been told i can, for any reason.

What's worse is that the cancellation was not immediate, it took almost two months for the process to be completed, and still, I was not alerted during the whole thing.

After raising a case with 3UK agents, they were unwilling to send the replacement SIM card to an overseas address, which was devastating for someone who returned to my home country after finishing college like me.

I will most definitely not be recommending this company, which only causes endless trouble for its users, anymore.",0
"This really is a scam but not your conventional scam where the product isn't real, this is a scam to make as much money out of you as possible by sending you cold soiled food.
I am honestly not exaggerating when I say that every time that I have ordered from this company there has been a problem. My food is always cold coffee is always spilt half is always missing and spilt coffee goes onto all my food making it totally inedible. Customer Service is hands down the most Ridiculous of all staff members are rude scripted responses are given you are offered a measly ¬£1 refund which is an insult if like me you've spent over ¬£20 on food. I'm always having to go to my bank and get them to intervene. Managers from Deliveroo take over the chat they are really rude never did they de-escalate or try to resolve the issue. Recently because I got my bank to intervene Deliveroo blocked my account and tried to put my account in the negative balance. this is where they make their money delivery drivers do not care that they come out and hand you a bag that is soaking wet and dripping coffee.. Because you don't get your refund Deliveroo are stealing your money and providing you with cold and quite honestly contaminated food.

Stay away from Virgin Media! Our contract was up for renewal and we only needed a 6 month contract as we‚Äôre away travelling afterwards. After around 7 different call‚Äôs trying to cancel and numerous departments we finally got through to a guy who offered us a 6 month contract. I decided to ring back and check that our contract was all good a few days after to be told that we‚Äôre on an 18 month contract despite the notes confirming our 6 month deal. They lie to your face and the whole process is just a sales game to them. They make the sale and worry about complaints later on down the line. DO NOT GO WITH VIRGIN MEDIA!!,0

Unfortunately when I e mailed QMF approximately 4 weeks later I was told there would be no refund due to being over 30 days. After many e mails QMF agreed to repair the phone. The phone was with them for over 2 months and whenever I chased this up the excuse was a backlog due to COVID. I eventually got the phone back and discovered it would not update and again the applications were locking out, many e mails back and forth over a number of weeks and QMF offered to replace my device. Not surprisingly once they received the original phone they sent a bill for ¬£150 to repair a chip on the screen. Despite the consumer rights act stating replacements will not incur additional costs for repair/replacement including cosmetic damage, QMF refused to undertake the repair without the additional payment. I purchased this faulty phone 7 months ago, it still does not work and it has now been returned to me. I would not recommend purchasing a device room this company.

"My data speeds are below 0.4Mb/s in many parts of south London but when I use a Vodafone SIM they shoot up to 200Mb/s.

I thought that can‚Äôt be right can it? So I contacted CS to ask what‚Äôs been happening. Talked for an hour and they told me to check all sorts of settings‚Ä¶ everything turned out to be set up correctly anyway.

In the end I myself found out on Three‚Äôs website that my area is experiencing congestion and that that‚Äôs why data is so slow. But why didn‚Äôt the advisor just tell me that at the beginning instead of wasting literally an hour asking me to check so many things? Blaming my device instead which was ridiculous.

Vod and data protection dont like anything non standard. Had a nightmare explaining the situation. Online chat nightmare, call centre nightmare.

I received a final bill account cancelled 4th Feb
I paid the debt in full of ¬£37.54 on the 9th Feb.

They have now passed a NEW Debt of ¬£43.69 to CAPITAL RESOLVE LTD. Super******.

Not acceptable. F***book/TW*Tter and other Anti-Social media have NO place in my life.
My Sibling will not respond.

VodaF*** had every opportunity to settle this bill with myself. I am the only person who is responsible and pays the bills. They have made this an unnecessary and no doubt expensive and protracted farce. They should have simply accepted that I pay the bills.

They have now decided that the final bill which I paid is not the final bill and now want more...... Is this legal?

The delivery men who arrived absolutely refused to do the installation, or to call Hughes to confirm that installation was ordered, or to accept evidence that I had paid for the installation service.

"After a new installation from BT I was pretty happy to have chosen the higher fibre connection. It turns out though that because I am quite far away from the junction box; my speed is slower than expected. Which is fine. It is quick enough.

The problem is that the connection regularly dips to a very slow speed (1.4mbps is not uncommon), and sometimes just drops out all together.

When I download a large file, it knocks out the connection on all of my other devices. I read somewhere that points at this being an ISP setting, but the helpline staff just automatically send out someone from openreach without actually looking at the problem. The guy at openreach said it was an ISP thing and not his problem.

I need a solid connection in the house, so I upgraded to the EE bonded service. Although it seems like the whole BT line needs to have failed before that kicks in (rather than it kicking in when it is faster than the broadband). So it is pretty useless.

I have had to have another line installed in my house now so that I can deal with the regular dips in service.

As soon as my contract ends. I am out of there.",0

"Sent my laptop in for a sticky key replacement and a minor cleanup.

I receive a text stating that they cannot complete the repair and the laptop will be returned to me. When I check the tracking page it says to contact them, so I do...

So it turns out they have decided to remove my battery and throw it away without any communication with me whatsoever. The battery did not need replaced. They have then found out that they cannot get a replacement battery, and are trying to return my laptop to me without one.

So... essentially they have stolen the battery out of my laptop.

Not to mention the fact that Richard (ID 10045) was literally the single worst person I have ever spoken to in a customer service role. Extremely rude, extremely dismissive, talks over me repeatedly.

Absolutely mind blowing. The laptop cost me around ¬£1,000 and it has been ruined. They then had the audacity to blame the Curry‚Äôs store for the wording on their terms and conditions which does NOT allow Knowhow to bin parts of my property.",0
"In my view, a very nasty and sinister company. I have a white Now TV box, which was working very nicely until Now TV decided to make it unusable late last year. Their response to my complaint is to go and buy a new stick. I still have the packaging for the old box and there is nothing in writing which allows Now TV to pull the plug whenever they want. Whist I might have bought the box, they clearly feel that they have the right to damage it's functionality whenever they please. The words'mindless spiteful thugs' is how I currently view their actions.

I have tried escalating this matter to a Mr Darroch, apparently the Chief Executive at Sky, but I should have saved myself the effort, as he has totally ignored the two emails I have sent to him.

To sum up, my view of Now TV is that it is a nasty unscrupulous company, who will sell you a product one day and cut you off without any notice the next, if it means maximising their profits. Take my advice and treat the company like the plague. I certainly will not be purchasing any further Sky products.",0

Two people said it was in stock. Two people said it was out of stock. Last person said I ‚Äúshould‚Äù receive it within 28 days but they don‚Äôt know as it‚Äôs a popular item.

Contacting my bank for a charge back as been left with no alternative - they are point blank refusing to cancel/refund my order, but won‚Äôt dispatch it either - and quite frankly. taking someone‚Äôs money and not sending the goods is nothing short of theft.

I then purchased a Dishwasher from Curry's in February this year and again due mainly to my age (73) and infirmity , I recently broke my leg . I decided that once again I would have to pay for Team Know How to do the plumbing in.
I was replacing a skirting board under the kitchen sink and noticed that there was a drip of water coming from the connecting hose and decided to make contact with Currys as I believed that they were responsible for the fitting crew , after using their automated system for 30 minutes and getting exasperated and nowhere fast , I was eventually informed by a Human Being that when the automated system asks for the make of washing machine do not answer and you will eventually be put through to a person .

The first person I spoke with advised me that she ""Didn't do leaks"" and passed me over to one of her colleagues Dan , after explaining the situation to him , he advised that he could not find me on their system as they wipe everything after three months, however after giving him the reference numbers for both machines , he informed that they could get someone out on the 29th August , I again informed him that this was a water leakage and I would be holding Team Know How responsible for any damage he informed me that that was the best he could do.

As typical of when I contact them, I often get a form letter back telling me how their quote service works or what their refund policy is neither of which typically addresses the actual question I posed. This was no different so I replied that the form response didn't address my issue. The issue was I paid 5 credits in order to answer a request for a balloon twister. The customer then submitted a second request 3 days later for the same service on the same date with nothing different. That request was only charging 3 credits to respond. I then contacted customer service to ask that 2 of the credits be returned since the second request was less. I was told that it didn't meet their refund policy. When I asked for clarification on why they charged two different credit amounts for the same request I was sent the same form response they sent me in the first email that didn't answer my questions. When I pointed this out they did another tactic they often do, which is to send my own message back to me without replying just to close out the question. It took over twenty emails for them to admit that they could not answer that question. When I asked to be forwarded to someone who could answer my question they told me they were not going to answer my emails any longer. I asked to be sent to someone in management that could answer that question and they told me I had to contact management myself and they would not forward the message. When I asked why they were unable to forward my question to management or find out the answer they told me that they would no longer be answering my questions and they would only respond with my own email sent back to me in order to close the question out on their end. So I decided to call the number listed on the website for customer service. When I explained the situation and asked why it was two separate charges for the same service his response was, don't you know how Google leads work? I asked for clarification and he said they charge different amounts depending on which day of the week the lead is submitted. I told him that is not how the Bark system worked according to the form letter they sent and when I tried asking for more information he said he didn't have any answers for me because he was working the night shift and the only thing they are there to do is process refunds not answer questions. He then hung up on me. When I tried calling back thinking it was accidental he put me on hold for 13 minutes and then hung up on me. I called back with my number hidden from the caller ID and he answered immediately but then hung up on me again when he realized it was me. He proceeded to hang up on me the two times I called back after that. I have had issues with their customer service in the past but this is the worst it has ever been. Another issue I've had on the platform is them not closing leads when a customer requests it. I will pay for a lead and contact a customer only to find out they already filled it and said they asked Bark to close the lead. They claim they close the leads as soon as the customer requests it but the notices that a lead has been canceled tend to come all at the same time every morning, sometimes multiple leads are closed simultaneously each morning at the same time. Also, I have spoken with customers who say they never received the response I sent through the message system from Bark. The notices that a customer has read my response only happen about once every 15 customers. When I'm paying anywhere from $5-$18 per request I respond to this adds up to quite a bit of money per actual response I get. In fact, I pay them more than any other service I use and don't get nearly as many responses as I do on the other services even though I message them through Bark's system, send a follow-up email from my own system, and follow up with a text and phone call. Often times when I try calling the number it is not in service. What I pay bark in two months is what I pay for an entire year of service elsewhere so the low quality of leads is also a concern.",0

"Ordered straighteners instead of curlers, my own fault but frustrating that I couldn't amend the order.
Waited over a week for delivery, returned at my own cost via tracked so I knew when it was delivered back to them. No correspondence once they received the return. Didn't reply to emails or chats and their phone line was constantly down.
Opened a case through PayPal, once it had been a month, and due to this received an email from GHD and a full refund within hours.
Lucky I used PayPal to make the payment, otherwise very doubtful I would have got my money back.
Found an alternative phone number for GHD through the case too - 01132615600
May help others get in touch.
In short, don't order from their site, use a stockist you trust. GHD products are available plenty of other places with much better customer service.",0
"How do you close an account with three....I thought i'd closed my account in June when my contract ended but Direct Debit kept being taken. Tried to close account in October....apparently computer says I was mistaken....In November account still live and DD taken. Apparently computer says I did not close my account.17th Jan 2023 DD taken. After over an hour on chat account still not closed. Phoned 333 customer services told me I was in error and they have no record of me closing my account. She said it will now be closed in February.....I asked for confirmation E.mail,Sorry we can't do that. So I have no proof it will be closed.
I know companies are not perfect but I've paid 6months for a sim i'm not using. I have had to screen shoot the chat as proof of contact and record the phone call. The trouble is Three won't be interested as their complaints procedure is dreadful. I am looking forward to my other two contracts to ending.
I have made a mistake remaining with 3.
So,just to advise, Three have become impossible to deal with please avoid if you want to avoid stress and long hours on chat",0
"Took out a Voda contract, on day 9 the iPhone 12 I got with the contract started playing up turned out to be a device issue, two days chasing Vodafone and 3 hours of call time later the resolution they come up with is a like for like replacement and nothing to compensate for my wasted time and the further few days it‚Äôll take me to change my puk code to go back to gif gaff, find another contract with a reputable company that takes customer service seriously and set that phone up. Steer clear of carphone warehouse they have loads of front companies such as mobiles.co.uk and many others, this is because car phone warehouse has lost so much of its reputation, it has to set up other companies with different names to sell you contracts which will usually come with faulty handsets! Most likely giving reconditioned phones which is how they manage to give cheap contracts. Be warned!!!!",0
"Got a message to say the phone was not in suitable condition and the price was being reduced but when I presented videos and pictures of the phone from the day I sent in perfect condition, they tried to shift and find other supposed things wrong. All of which were dismissed with my evidence.

I refused the offer and requested my phone back so I could send elsewhere. A week later and no phone. Then j received a message asking if I‚Äôd consider the reduced offer before they send it back.

They‚Äôve simply messed me around and wasted time to mess about with my freedom to send elsewhere in good time trying to ‚Äúforce‚Äù me into accepting a low offer.

I should have simply gone to music magpie from the start!!

Disgusting service.",0
"One of the worst companies I have dealt with. I have been trying to get WiFi installed for 3 months with BT they have sent countless people to my house and messed it up every time. I‚Äôve spoken to about ten different people on the phone all who tell me something different, say they are going to sort it and never do never follow up so I have to sit on the phone for hours trying to speak to someone and re explain my issue every time as no one seems to take notes. Raise complaints and they automatically shut them down without speaking to me. Finally got WiFi installed after 3 months and it does not work. They also promise to supply you with a mini hub if they can‚Äôt set up WiFi immediately however after ringing several times I never received one so they also lie. I have never dealt with such an incompetent company classic example of a big company taking the p**s because they can and ripping you off. Avoid at all costs !!!!",0

"I would never use Carphone warehouse again.i feel that they have deliberately miss led customers acted completely unethically and stolen my money. I made an agreement that I would pay them 99 for a phone. The next day I was told it was on the way. Text from bank to say I had gone over drawn and they had taken 499. At no point was it mentioned any other figure then 99. They have now had my money for over a week and I have no phone, Anglo they have told me I won‚Äôt be getting one. Quick to lie, take my money, no hurry to give the money back. Disgraceful!!! I would say appalling customer service but that would actually mean there was some level of customer service. I would not trust them to do the correct thing or to rectify it if there was a mistake, I can‚Äôt afford to take the risk of losing 500 randomly. Don‚Äôt think many people have that much spare cash at the minute. I would strongly urge you to think twice, can you afford a mistake like someone taking a random un agreed amount from your bank then having no commitment to pay it back??",0
"Absolute trash. Every night my internet stops working for about two hours. I have emailed them 3 times about this. The one reply I have had so far, they address everything that could possibly go wrong with the internet except for the fact that I do not have it. I am connected but the connection has no internet.

Though I never complained about Wi-Fi they felt the need to tell me the following. This is a direct quote from their email.
'As a service provider we do not guarantee a wireless connection'

I want to cancel but as they refuse to acknowledge there is any problem, they charge ¬£16 per month for the remainder of my contract. 11 months...",0
If you want a weak dribble of Internet then look no further. Tie yourself into a two year contract to enjoy substandard connection and then once you tell them you're leaving them it appears they punish you for your last days by making it even more terrible than you remember,0

It has now taken me almost a month to get in touch with the regular customer services to further discuss advanced data recovery. Despite receiving texts asking me to call another number, I think it was the direct line for the workshop, they did not answer once in as long.

This morning after about an hour's waiting on hold, I got through to customer service and insisted they put me through to the workshop where I was told they ""don't know"" when my data will be recovered and was charged ¬£350 for the privilege.

It's been a truly appalling service.",0
"I would rate lower than 1 star if I could. I sent my phone in for trade in. Before sending I thoughly checked it over to make sure it had no screen burn. No scratches ect. After about 5 days of them having the phone I received an email saying they can't except the phone as fully working, due to screen burn (which wasn't there before), and rather than giving me ¬£180 which was the initial offer, they could only offer me ¬£30 something. I rejected the offer the same day. Over 14 days later I received an email saying they will send it back and will give me the tracking details once they had them. I never received the details. So how do I know they caused the screen burn not me?
1. I always had my phone in dark mode meaning the time, battery and icons, ect would always be white. The screen burn is black, as if the icons were black.

2. One of the icons burned in on the screen was Samsung's internet home button. I never used Samsung's internet, I've always used chrome.

3. I sent my phone off with 100% battery. Turned off. I received it back with 9% turned off. What have they done with it too use that much battery. When I turned it on the brightness was right up, past the safety warning, again something I would never do

Edit. After further inspection I have noticed they have tampered with my phone and now it will no longer have the IP rating it should.",0
"An appalling experience with their broadband. Switched and took their most expensive ""Super Fibre"" (two steps up from their so-called ""Brilliant Broadband""). The router is unfit for purpose. In recent years I have been used to pretty good wifi at home with the signal reaching all areas of our home. Not with Now TV Broadband, oh no. 10 steps is all it takes to lose the signal, and even when right next to the router the signal is flakey and very poor. On day one of service I called customer service to complain and was told ""We do not promise full coverage it's in the Terms & Conditions"". Flabbergasted is a polite word I suppose.
I should have done my homework better. The Internet is littered with people saying how genuinely awful this service is. The router is an obsolete model handed down from Sky. It has only 2 ethernet sockets and is utter crap. Not fit for purpose.
I switched away immediately and my advice to anyone is do not touch Now TV Broadband with a bargepole. Oh yes, as a consequence I also cancelled my Now TV account. I felt ripped off and violated and want nothing to do with them ever again (and that includes Sky).",0
"If I could give a lower score I would. It costs more than all other streaming services. You have to pay ¬£5 more just for HD - not even 4K. Disney Plus comes with 4K, Amazon and Netflix do also and still cost less. Especially when you consider Netflix and Amazon each have films and that cost even more on Now.

Genuinely the worst value for money. Game of Thrones cannot save them. It's all one big con to encourage people to get their TV package with the genuinely awful box. It's about time Sky retired and let Amazon, Netflix and Disney purchase their repertoire of films and shows and be done with it.",0
Appalling customer services. You‚Äôll sign up for two years and regret it the first time you have an issue with your broadband and need to speak to someone. Queues for hours. Poor English. Then you‚Äôll get an advert through the door for the same service for 50% less than what you pay but for new customers only. 3 prices increases in 18 months so far. There‚Äôs 1 person dealing with all broadband tech issues at Vodafone tonight. I‚Äôm not joking!,0
Avoid like the coronavirus. I have probably spent close to 5 hours on the phone to get a repair booked for a washing machine.

After 3 50 minute phone calls they eventually accepted the fault and arranged an uplift and exchange for the 27th December, I got a text saying I was getting a delivery the day before between 12 and 4.

Also their engineers never ever came on the date they were meant to come, for example when I was moving which meant that I was left without internet for weeks before they finally arrived.

I have spent several hours on the phone on many occasions. Despite promises to send a lead it has never arrived. I still have no home phone despite paying for it.

They weren't happy when I insisted about it being under warranty and so therefore not having to pay. They reluctantly decided to repair for free but one of the guys couldn't believe it was a year old due to it being in such good condition with no marks on it at all.
When I got the phone back the screen was hanging off, was cracked and scratched as well as the corner or the phone being damaged. They said they couldn't help it as they had to remove the screen.
I was told it was unfixable due to water damage so took it to the Samsung repair shop for a second opinion as no way did it have water damage. The guy there couldn't believe the screen was hanging off, or the fact that when he opened it up the water damage indicator had not been activated therefore it had no water damage. Samsung fixed in the end but I would never trust these guys with anything again. They lie and damage your property.",0

"Spent hours on the phone to Virgin Media (VM) trying to get my Mother's Internet service changed from her old address, into a new address that she will hopefully be moving into. I have explained to VM time and time again that my Mum is currently in hospital awaiting discharge and that she is unable to leave hospital until the Internet has been connected. My Mother is 96 years old and has several disabilities, she relies on assistive technology (alarm call buttons - falls sensors etc), which rely on Internet connection. Mum also has a ruptured Aortic Annurism, and end stage COPD and lung cancer. We have been told by her Consultant that she has weeks left to live. Her wish is to pass away at home - not in hospital.
Several people at VM are aware of my Mum's plight, yet none seem motivated to help. Concerningly, on a number of occasions, VM call centre staff have just hung up on me mid call, and there has been no attempt to call me back.
I would never again be able to recommend VM to anyone. It's been a steep and painful learning curve. This business is more than inefficient - it is grotesque!!!

Following VM's response - your reply completely neglects to address any of my concerns. I would strongly advise anybody from entering into a contract with Virgin Media. For a company that portrays itself as being progressive, you are both short sighted and hard of hearing!",0
"Avoid at all costs!!!

I recently signed up to virgin, i haven‚Äôt even been installed yet, but already i have been left disappointed on several occasions!!!

I was told when signing up that i would have a call 3 days later with an earlier date, 3 days later no call. I called again to be told i was put on a priority list for earlier installation.

I received a call tonight from virgin, as i answered i had a message to say contact virgin media. I called immediately and was put on hold. I asked for a call back if i get disconnected. 30mins on hold and a completely different person answered welcoming me to virgin media ü§¨

When i can get back through i will be cancelling. All this hassle, and i am not even signed up. What a joke!!!",0
"This must be the worst ""online"" purchase experience I have ever had! Ordered a refurbed ipad mini on 23rd March - expected 7-10 day delivery. After 2 weeks I contacted them and was asked to allow a bit longer. After a further week - was asked to allow another 1-4 days. When one month had passed I requested an update and was told they didn't have a stock item to send so had cancelled my order!!! Was furious at having to wait so long to be told this! Since then I have sent numerous emails and have also tried live chat to try to obtain a refund but no one will communicate. Almost five weeks after my original order I'm still trying to get my money back. Awful company to deal with - dreadful customer service. My advice - steer well clear!!",0
"Offered me ¬£225 for my Samsung galaxy fe 21. It had only been used 4 months and had always had a case and screen protector on. There were no scratches on the phone at all.
So imagine my surprise when 3 days after receiving my phone (advertised as same day service - that didn't happen) I received an email stating that due to more than 3 scratches they are lowering the price they would offer me.
As I have already spent ¬£8 sending the phone to them by special delivery I felt I had to take the lower amount.
I have another 2 phones to send but most certainly not be using this company again!",0

"Would give zero if that was an option. Appalling all-round service. Do not subscribe! Broadband service drops every 48 hours with message on website that engineers are fixing the area problem. Same message for the last 6 months. Engineer booked and turned up, however his testing equipment didn't work but he did confirmed the problem was in the Virgin control box at the end of the street. He was supposed to have arranged for a separate team of engineers to fix the problem. Problem persisted and one week later I called customer service who said the engineer hadn't sent any message and they would arrange a visit. 6 weeks on and the broadband connection is still intermittent. Engineers are supposed to have visited to fix the issue but no one has confirmed this and the broadband connection is still intermittent. The last feedback from the customer service team was for me to contact the relevant Virgin engineering as they had obviously given up. Some customer service. No one has proactively contacted me to explain the issue and what is being done to fix it. The company clearly doesn't seem to care or respond about the about the predominantly -ve reviews posted on line either. Complete joke of a company.",0
"The actual product is perfect and the process to buy was easy. However I suggest you get a new delivery company as APS is appalling. The TV didn't arrive till 2 days after it should of, the delivery information being sent to be was confirming it would be delivered but on a day already been and gone and the customer service was terrible, with staff being rude and unhelpful. If a failed delivery was attempted we never had any notification of it and didn't go out on the day it was scheduled for so we wouldn't miss it. The rude lady on the phone said it was because they had 4 drivers off sick so it hadn't been dispatched yet.

"We were offered a replacement washer dryer by Beko, through Currys/PC World, when our current one, under extended warranty couldn't be repaired. We were on the phone 2-3 times each week trying to get the replacement. There was no other way of contacting Team Knowhow as the email box is full so won't be looked at!! and nobody was able to phone us back. In the 2.5 months that we contacted Team Knowhow we were frequently given incorrect advice and hung up on by staff members on numerous occasions. We sent 2 letters of complaint by recorded delivery, which were ignored. After numerous phone calls we were told we could have a refund but only upon the surrender of our broken machine. We reluctantly agreed but received no confirmation of removal of the machine. When the promised money did not reach our bank account we were told that we were entitled to a considerably smaller amount of money than promised. It has only just been resolved after we involved Which and Trading Standards. We were thankfully refunded the ¬£103 we had spent in phone calls.
We will NEVER AGAIN purchase anything from Team Knowhow or Currys PC World",0
"The mobile internet is SO unreliable, this has been going on for so long now they clearly don't care anymore. Been a customer for at least 8 years, cancelled my mobile broadband a while ago and I'm going to start looking for a replacement for my phone now. I've had enough.",0
"Just to share my story.
The broadband service from this company is indeed terrible, do not get fooled by the price they offer. The service simply cannot be activated as their cooperation with Openreach is horrendous. They would sell you a service that isn't even happening 12 days after it is supposed to start. I stated that I don't mind a new landline in my order, and they told me that they can't take over my landline and hence their service cannot be activated, literally told me to cancel the current order and place a new one and of course, the activation date will be delayed again since it will be a new order.

The compensation is also not happening due to the fact the service isn't even activated yet, which makes their advertisement' compensate ¬£5.25 every day after activation day that was delayed' a total scam.

I wouldn't say their customer service is bad, it is just the company is not competent as a broadband provider, they would sell you a service that isn't even going to work and convince you that everything will be sorted. It has been the most stressful 12 days of my life, not only working every day but also communicating with Vodafone under incredible stress.

I chose to cancel the order and not to place it again as I don't believe what they have told me, nothing is certain and guaranteed, apart from the stress being real. Even if I place the order again, I believe that Vodafone will fail to do what it promised again. It has been the most stressful 12 days of my life.

I will avoid this company at any cost for the rest of my life",0
Day after day of failed calls to update me on what is happening with my broadband. Had nothing for over a week so will now issue a court summons for breach. Shame on your appalling treatment of customers. BT is now an organisation out of control and out of touch.,0
"Didn‚Äôt want to give a star but no option. Very poor customer service, promised to connect to my new property within 24 to 48 hours but postponed it to more than 10 days. When disputed customer has been blamed to mis hear. Wanted to disconnect put through their disconnection team line drop off after 30 minutes had to call again been on wait for another 20 minutes already no answers",0
"I called Currys customer service on behalf of my brother this evening. You are unable to call a store directly. My brother bought a washing machine which was delivered at the end of November.

When he eventually installed it, it became clear there was a fault and it was clearly not fit for purpose. They tried calling however, as most people will have experienced it is not exactly straight forward to get through to talk to someone. This mixed with opening hours and holidays proved to cause more delays.

I phoned on his behalf, eventually finding away to speak to someone. I thought great, how wrong was I. Basically, they wash their hands of customers after 30days (not customers clothes) regardless of it being a few days after 30 days period (due to holidays and infuriating phone system).

The customer service personnel was at one point practically shouting at me. Especially when they said they should of just gone to the store, I stated they obviously could not. They said it's not their problem. However, when I asked if the only way to report an issue is to return to the store to which their reply was, yes if your not able to get us on the phone (near impossible). Then they went on to state 'well clearly they where able to go to the store to buy it, why couldn't they go back'.

To be honest this infuriated me, there could well be a large number of reasons. The manor in which this was asked was not to be helpful it was said with a raised voice and so undermining. The call from the very second it was answered was not pleasant, professional, helpful or even just understanding to the fact this was really just unfortunate set of circumstances.

So the irony is that if they eventually get someone from the manufacture guarantee to check the machine (over 2 weeks wait) and find a fault it then is classified as an 'inherent fault' so that is the seller that sold it with a fault (Currys).

My issue isn't that their machine clearly has a fault, these things happen. It was how difficult it was to try and actually speak to someone and when you do be spoke to in such a way that is so so disrespectfully. I would have always bought from the store as the staff there are great, however I can't see it happening again. I get that I won't impact them, but I will have better peace of mind I am going to be treated appropriately.",0

"Where do I begin with this vile company! I was with Vodafone for 12 years dutifully paying my phone bills and nearly left a few times but got talked into staying...then got talked into buying a google pixel phone and extortionate contract off them 2 years ago, the worst phone I've ever had in my life and an extremely expensive contract that I could of got cheaper elsewhere. I ended up buying a new phone early on as the pixel was just useless...I rang Vodafone a few times to sort issues out with the phone but hey when your stuck in an expensive contract they don't give a damn and are just downright unhelpful. When my contract was up I rang to leave this vile company and yes as usual took ages to answer, ages to sort leaving, I asked that there were no outstanding charges and told there wasn't. Just got a letter from debt collection agency saying I owe this disgusting company ¬£20.72 + charges! They hadn't even sent me a letter previously about this...Vodafone are categorically the most shambolic, rude rip off company going.

"I bought a Nikon D5600 camera and Sigma lens. Unable to test them in the store as there was no charge on the camera. Once I got them home the camera worked fine with the kit lens but the no picture could be taken with Sigma lens unless in manual focus.

The next day I returned to the store and demonstrated the problem with the camera. I then had to wait 1hr only to be told there was no problem with the lens. I asked the tester to take a picture with my camera with the sigma lens - he couldn't.

I asked for my money to be returned, he refused only offering a voucher. He said it was down to compatibility not a fault. The lens is listed as being compatible with the camera.

The problem with CEX is they're only interested in getting, and keeping, your money. Surely given the fact the lens didn't work with the compatible camera that it was purchased for showed there was an fault, especially when it was returned with 24 hours.

I should have been given a refund not a credit voucher.

Update: -
I repeat - Sigma state that the lens is compatible with the D5600. Only the CEX member of staff stated it wasn't, obviously to get out of a refund for a faulty lens.

No email has been received and I've checked SPAM folders.",0
"Following an upgrade at the end of November 2022, where they agreed the new price, they sent confirmation of the new contract at the new price.
I then received an invoice at 3 times the price agreed, when I phoned to complain and spoke to someone on the other side of the planet, they reduced the amount but not to the initial agreed price, they then said there would be a credit on the next bill. Following several more phone calls to Vodafone, to people in various countries all over the world, it seems to be impossible to speak to someone in the UK, where Vodafone are supposed to be based.
When the next bill arrived that was still overcharged, they now appear to have charged 3 times the amount for delivery than is quoted in the initial contract paperwork. It also states on my account on their website that next months bill will also be more than the agreed price.
I resisted from upgrading last year because of the abysmal service I received last time, and only did this time because the phone was old and getting slow.
I really wish that I had found another supplier.
I urge anyone to not upgrade with Vodafone as they clearly are incapable of getting anyones bill correct afterwards.",0

"BT wrongly stopped my daughter‚Äôs mobile data at half of monthly usage allowance and charged for excess. Thankfully I‚Äôd set a ¬£5 limit otherwise it could have been expensive. I‚Äôve got 2 sims and a broadband contract. When I called BT they eventually admitted to the error( first time I called they said we‚Äôd used all the data but the MyBT site took a few days to catch up). Then after what I consider to be high pressure selling tactics (over an hour on the phone) they persuaded me to switch mobiles and broadband to a new EE package. It was going to be cheaper and better. I haven‚Äôt checked, perhaps it will be, I really don‚Äôt know. But it breaks the BT contract and had a an inflation busting rise built in. Also I lose free EU roaming and have to buy a ¬£10 data pack instead. At the end they said that I‚Äôd get new mobile numbers but that wasn‚Äôt a problem as they‚Äôd port them through so the old numbers would be back in a day or two. They said the 2 new sims would be here the next day. Next day came and only 1 sim arrived with no info on which one it was. So I called BT again and they said it was my daughters sim and that mine had been cancelled for a reason they didn‚Äôt know. I asked when I‚Äôd get my sim and they said they would need to put me through to the switching team again. I‚Äôd had enough by then so decided to cancel everything. I didn‚Äôt like the high pressure selling and the hassle this was causing. OK I know BT and EE merged but they don‚Äôt seem to be joined up yet and giving a good customer service. I will probably have to switch sometime but it will be on my terms and not through high pressure selling. I expect a load of broadband kit will arrive tomorrow and I will return it.",0

"AVOID

In feb 2021 we had a problem with our Beko washing machine we called and had a someone come out to look at it. Basically it needed a new door and a new drum which they ordered and said someone would be in touch to fit.

Not happy with this as can‚Äôt be without a machine, so we had to purchase another and was informed at the time to keep the receipt and email it through to them and they would arrange a refund. Well what an absolute joke this was after numerous emails and chase up phone call we were hung up on and no response to the emails we were told that they hadn‚Äôt received the email even though we had sent it through numerous times, we finally after 2 MONTHS received a voucher, and after querying this via emails and phone calls we were eventually told that if we took it to a curry‚Äôs store we could get it transferred back in to our bank.

"Shocking experience.
My daughter was talked into a upgrade. Promised a good deal, i was standing there at the time, listening to the conversation. All I can say it was all very untruthful, used as sales technique.
I had queried the cost of the phone, but I was assured this would be my daughters monthly bills once all the discounts were applied!!
Discounts were never applied leaving a very expensive monthly bill.
This kind of sales technique is so unethical.
The phone had to go back to store several times just before lockdown . It just does not work correctly. Once again promises from the manager, along with free gifts, all of which never materialised.
The phone is still not working correctly, freezers, turns it's self off, unable to connect to network and other features do not work. My daughter has been trying to email carphone warehouse since April to try and resolve these major issues.
Not only has my daughter been left with an expensive faulty phone with excessive bills nearly twice as much as the manager said it would be.
We have tried in vain to contact customer services and just been fobbed off.

Requested a phone number for someone who covers the stores within curry's here in Scotland.
The customer service employee in Mumbai refused and cut the call.
Wonderful customer service!

My daughter has a medical condition so a working phone is very important.
I would not recommend Carphone Warehouse to anyone.
Broken false promises, faulty phone with no answers.
The manager has now left the company, surprise surprise.
We need urgent help.
So far we have made 6 calls today, one ended up in Mumbai, the others in South Africa none can help.

"I've experienced so many problems with Now Broadband since August, which started off as one thing and then turned into another and another. Each time I have to explain the situation from the start and each time they create a new problem! I am now at the point of still chasing them for a refund which they assured me over the phone they would process. After weeks of no refund, I followed up with them twice, yet received no response, and upon emailing again, 30 minutues ago, received an auto response telling me the case has now been closed! I am shocked, and lost all trust in this company.

Put simply, they do not do what they say they are going to do, effectively lieing to buy time, and wear customers out. I am sure they are trying to make customers give up however I am not going to! I am now escalating my complaint to an external party as this is not okay - this is clearly an unethical company trying to rip people off, and hope everyone gives in on chasing them because it takes too much of cusomters' personal time.

I would never buy from this company again. I am not in the habit of writing reviews like this at all, but this is a highly unethical company, and feel they need to be investigated properly as they are many smaller strategies they use to keep taking money - save yourself the trouble and do not buy their services.

Had no internet since April, had my service started then cancelled three times! with no explanation but it was BT‚Äôs mistake, tried to make a complaint, staff won‚Äôt even note the call and even closed my complaint even though I explicitly said I don‚Äôt want to close it, I‚Äôve had a complete run around, one cares to follow through on thier promises complete failure on there behalf

While waiting for your call to be answered ‚Äúbt are committed to give excellent service‚Äù I‚Äôve experienced nothing but the complete opposite

Horrible service, terrible untrained staff",0
"You signed up a new contract with EE for a female and between you and EE have managed to add that number to my account a Male who clearly didn‚Äôt fill out the details on your system different gender different name, but it was still added to my contract which I payed for this month from my bank account but the phone and number don‚Äôt belong to me.
I‚Äôve called car phone warehouse and EE to have this removed several times now and neither of you can explain why this has happened nor wish to resolve the issue it‚Äôs just ‚Äúsorry sir this is not our problem‚Äù I cannot get a refund for my payment or the bank charge I received for this overpayment from my bank account.
Totally disgraceful mistake by yourselves and terrible service in resolving it NOT",0
I purchased something 30th November still in warehouse needed for Christmas!,0
They only got one star coz none isn‚Äôt an option. Take yr cash never bring full order and are a pain in the neck when you try get yr hard earned cash back. STAT CLEAR,0

"Appalling service 20 phone calls later and numerous disconnects no phone connection no WiFi discs and now told order will be cancelled ie will disconnect my internet which works downstairs and is essential for work and caring responsibilities

Worse service ever received from a company",0
Took a day off work as had a text to say my delivery was due the next day but on day of supposed delivery received a call mid morning to say my item was not in stock and therefore having to take another days holiday to wait for delivery.,0
"Purchased a 5g mobile broadband contract and on the first day of use could not get 5g, with download speeds of <10mbps.

Spoke to the technical team who stated there were known issues in the area and recommended I wait for a month when planned upgrades would occur. This recommendation would have resulted in me being outside the cooling of period and resultantly being tied into a product which the team knew were faulty.

I don't know I was sold a product which advertised a service which three knew was not deliverable, and think it is awful business practice to recommend customers wait for a time when they could no longer cancel their contracts, knowing the product does not work as advertised.

I cancelled my contract on the same day I received the product and overall have wasted hours of my time and will now be without Internet whilst I look for an alternative provider. Overall, an extremely poor experience which could have been much worse if I followed the recommended advice.",0
"I was really disappointed with virgin media's customer service. I spoke to them to add extra tv channels to see the cricket. But they wrongly added many tv channels and increased my bill 3 times more than previously. When I asked them to cancel all and go back to the original package, they forced me to stick to a middle package. Finally, I argued with them and removed all extras that they added wrongly, but still, my bill is 1.5 times higher than the previous one. They really are not customer focus and are not flexible at any time. So not recommended this company for anyone who needs internet and tv. If I can rate zero stars, that's the best fixed for them",0
"I have been without a working oven for 2 months, I have had 3 or 4 appointments cancelled and am still waiting for an engineer to come out and even look at my gas cooker. Absolutely disgusting service, when I ring D&G I keep getting told if I don‚Äôt hear in the next 2 days ring back. Every time I ring I‚Äôm on hold for what seems like forever I am dreading my phone bill as I am a pensioner with NO COOKER",0
"Our internet service is completely unreliable, it loses connection all the time, and we can‚Äôt run more than about 2 devices on it at a time. Customer service unhelpful. Worst decision ever made switching to you. Never had a problem with sky.",0

"Pretty disgusting at the moment. I've had Nowtv for several year, using what I want without any problems. Now (being a pensioner) they are taking ¬£35 a month off me for a service I cannot get. This is going to be cancelled this week. As for customer service , yes she was a lovely person, but could not solve the problem and said the technical team would come back to me within 48 hours... 60 hours later and they still have not. This is now 6 days I have not been able to get onto the system...goodbye !!!!!!",0
Really upset with the phone call I had this morning with carphone warehouse... after applying online for a phone they emailed me asking me to call for more information. Did my part called and was greeted spoken to like I was wasting their time - no pleases thank you or hold a moment no politeness to the call. To carry on I unfortunately didn‚Äôt get the phone after running another check and he simply said well no that‚Äôs been declined ok bye... and put the phone down! I was shocked the way it was dealt with on the phone I will not be referring any one their way!,0
Still trying to get a refund for ¬£120 for something you never managed to give to me!,0
"‚ÄúThree‚Äù advertised that those customers on tariffs from before October 2021 would not have to pay their new daily roaming charge.

After being their customer for about eight years, they forced me on to another tariff, I had no choice about this.

This was declared as a new tariff and roaming charges would be made as I was on a ‚Äúnew‚Äù tariff. I would have to pay their new roaming charge from five days later. What a despicable way of doing business.

Of course, I am leaving and telling everyone. Neither O2 or Virgin are making these new charges.

Goodbye Three.

Edit: 19/05/22
Three say ""The new charge ensures that customers are clear on what to pay when using our services abroad"". I was very clear what to pay before - nothing.

Three say ""We aim at giving great experience and being transparent"". There was NOTHING great about my experience. There is nothing transaparent about forcing a customer on to a tariff that they do not wanbt to be on and then claiming that it is a new tariff and making daily charges. It is in fact cheating and dispicable.",0
"I placed an order for an iPhone 13 mini on the 6th January which was accepted. However 6 days later, it was cancelled due to a pricing glitch. Very disappointed they haven't honoured their pricing, especially when it was advertised as the hottest deal of the day. They also done a hard credit search against me. I'm now awaiting proper compensation for this absolutely disgraceful scenario",0
"Dishonest about network performance.
Visited a 3 shop and after being fobbed off prior the phone or sim card faulty, decided to prove they are dishonest.
With our 2 contact phones in weston Super Mare asked them to do a speed test on their work phones and as they agreed-asked them then to turn wifi off on phones.
The results were several tests wouldn't load on the phones and eventually if it did load-horrific download and ping times with ok upload.
Simply put store staff give blazing fast speeds based on vdsl/fibre and not three mobile network.
At home/locally for years got decent speeds on 3 and now awful.
Been with three since they launched, afraid that after lies and poor speeds etc- wouldn't want to be tied into a 2 or 3 year contract so will be leaving.
Disappointed that they are dishonest and needed to be caught red handed, excuses being handset, sim card, apn settings-all lies",0

"Been a customer with Vodafone for 10+ year's. Have finally left them! Absolutely awful customer service skills. Useless. They stopped my direct debit for monthly payments so bill kept rolling over. Phoned up after first month to sort out. Lady didn't know what it happened so reset the direct debit, happend again the next month, phoned up again ""sorted"". Rolled over to the 3rd month! Went into shop to get PAC code as I was leaving, staff member phoned up from shop to sort out the payment. All sorted just a small bill of around ¬£14 to pay when contract switched. Had bill in January for ¬£108.96? My credit score has been affected because if their incompetence. Absolute joke. Stay far away from Vodafone. Absolute disgrace

Edit, not early termination fee. Price racking up because you didn't take direct debit out. Contract was up in January l",0
"Incompetent & Bullies
We tried to join BT 8 months ago, however they reported a fault on the line. Whilst they corrected the issue they sent us a free sim card to use, however it did not work with any of our devices. They are now trying to charge us for this sim card and their money recovery team are harassing us for payment. We have tried to resolve this issue 4 times but are still getting payment notification letters.

We are now following this up with the ombudsman.",0

"Went to switch from Sky to Vodafone due to the discounted offer for fibre broadband.

Shambolic company, the order was cancelled without letting me know. Customer service diabolical using the online chat feature.

TBH glad it was cancelled after looking at the experience of other people.

DO NOT USE VODAFONE.

P.S. hurry up and send me the returns bag.",0
NOWTV scam. I cancelled my trial months ago just to find out that they were still taking money using my debit card details. They refused to refund me saying that I didn't finish a 6 pages cancelation (I did) and even though they can check that I had never used their services. There are other customers complaining about the same. Beware.,0

"Since placing the order on the 16th June 2020 for a mobile phone that I had not received by the 31st of July I decided to cancel my order and I requested a full refund.
I was informed, after several e-mails that I would receive a refund on or before the 2nd October 2020. I have not received the refund and I have now been informed (because I emailed the company) that I will now receive the refund on or before the 3rd of November.
I do not wish to wait until the 3rd of November to be informed that I will receive the refund on or before the 4th of December and so on.

Can you please advise me further on the course of action I should now pursue as the sum of ¬£359.99 is significant to my own family finances, particularly as I have had to buy a mobile device from elsewhere.
Having had this company recommended, I would NOT recommend anyone to use this company. I am still waiting for ¬£359.99 to be refunded to me.
I am now making inquiries to the Financial Ombudsman to see where I stand.
Despite making numerous ( 15 +) email enquiries, there has only been a continued postponement of any repayment. I have emailed every 2-3 weeks for since June. It's appalling customer service and a breach of contract under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and Trading Standards.",0

"At the beginning of purchasing a dual contract (for mobile broadband and sim only), I was told by a customer representative that I would (upon payment of three months of on time paid bills, that I would receive a phone of my choice (which I had made), but was advised that I just had to call up a representative, tell them about the purchase and that no fuss would be made and that I could claim this offer and that this automatically forgoes the need to go through a credit checking process. Unfortunately, by many representatives (some who were actually very rude) I have been told that this wasn‚Äôt the case and I didn‚Äôt receive what I had been initially promised, at all and had therefore been mis-sold which as a still active customer, is not only hugely disappointing & disgraceful, but also, isn‚Äôt a great representation in terms of it‚Äôs promise to customers who follow the procedures, never mind the fact that had I known at the beginning, that I would not have proceeded in purchasing this deal in the first place.",0

"Where do I start.
I've been with vodafone for many years but customer loyalty means nothing to them.
Recently tried to renew my sons contract on my account with a new deal but despite being with them for years they couldn't offer me a deal as good as third party providers. If I get a vodafone deal with a third party provider they won't let you keep your mobile number.
On top of this, whilst using online chat with Vodafone I got an email saying a new number, which I didn't recognise ,had been added to my account. It must have been the Vodafone rep I was talking to at the time that added this number to my account as it was to coincidental. I had to report it to their fraud team, spent hours on the phone trying to sort it out, lost access to my account and after 3 days just received an email saying my account was now secure, with no apology or explanation as to how this number was added to my account (it was obviously an error by their online rep).

Opened a complaint and this department are even worse, said they couldn't find any phone calls but after speaking to 3 people in one phone call because they are useless 2 of them admitted to finding my phone calls on the system.

I contact carphonewarehouse via one of there stores. They told me that they would send the device off to there service centre and and told me it was water damaged. This suggests to me that the phone was not propperly sealed in the first place, as it had not met the IP67 rating requirments which it is advistised as having. The phone had not come into contact with water over 1m in for any ammount of time. I've emailed and called them constantly to be told to use there online chat sevice... which they have not linked me to and is not active on there website.

I believe the people working in Currys are not serious for their work and are more relaxed and do not care about their own reputation. The issue is with my Business account. I placed an order for 24 inch Moniotor before Christmas and I have not received till date. I have asked them to refund my money and they have not done that either. So, guys if you are planning to have a business account with Currys, I strongly recommend - NO. Because I wrote to there senior management team and I havent heard back from them as well. No Call, No email. Meaning they give a damn. There is no SLA met, no ETA updates. So if any of you are planning to do business, please give 100 thoughts before you make a decision to work with Currys.

Date: 17/01/2023
Current status - After calling Curry's I was told that they havent done my refund till date. Multiple calls done but you guys can not even refund my own money. You had your product with you all this time and till date you havent given my money. Horrible service. No Ownership taken by any one from the company. LOL",0

"Where do I start! I purchased a new iPhone 14 pro at the end of September 2022 and seen that if you trade your old mobile in you would receive an extra ¬£50 on top of your trade in amount for purchasing any iPhone 14. I thought this was a good deal and went ahead with my purchase and was given a price of ¬£185 trade in for my old phone. My new phone came, and my old phone went away. I sent this by recorded next day deliver. They received this the next day but no confirmation apart from my royal mail track number. I continued to hear nothing for about a week and then I contacted them. I was then emailed to say that a payment of ¬£180 would be processed. Not the price i was quoted but not going to cry over ¬£5. This then went in my bank but no extra ¬£50. I am now on week 4 since they received my phone and i have called them about 4-5 times. Each time i have been told that this has been escalated and they have 5 days to respond. I have received an email to say that the ¬£55 will be processed but again 1 week later still no money. I called last Friday and was told that this would be in my bank by 24hrs which being a Friday i had no confidence and yet again Monday has arrived and no money. Another call to say i have to give them another 5 days to escalate this. If you were to total the amount of time I have been on hold and speaking to someone it must be around the 3hr mark. I have had enough and i will be going to trading standards regarding this. You cannot offer a promotion and not fulfil this! be warned from curry's/Carphone warehouse customer service is dreadful.",0

Opened the DPD outer packaging, only to find the phone box has been ripped open and the contents of the box (Phone, cables etc) just laying in the bag.

I am absolutely furious about this, and it's left a very sour taste about coming back again.",0
AVOID. I bought a curry. Delivery person made no attempt to contact us. Took the curry away and presumably consumed it. Deliveroo refused to refund. Never using them again.,0
"Absolutely pathetic!!! I purchased a phone and contract on Monday 14/03/22 and so far, I have not been able to use the sim card in my phone as it STILL has NOT been activated. I have contacted several people via the online messaging service and have been told that my sim card should have been activated by now. I have also spoken to four different people from the customer service team on the phone, one person told me that my sim card would be activated by Wednesday (16/03/22), another person told me that my sim card would be activated the following day. As a first-time customer with Vodafone, this has been a horrible experience and I do not recommend this company to anyone... ***UPDATE 18/03/22 - I went to the Vodafone store in Canary Wharf to return my phone and cancel the contract, I was told that where the sim card is not active, they cannot cancel the contract and I cannot return the phone until they activate the sim which could take up until 23/03/22!",0
I bought a refurbished phone from QMF at the end of October 2020 for ¬£280 and after waiting for it to arrive for two months I asked for a refund and it has never materialised. I have about 50 emails from them saying they‚Äôll refund me by such and such a date but they were clearly fobbing me off as they‚Äôre now not replying to my emails and I understand they‚Äôve done a runner. I contacted the police and they‚Äôve closed the case saying there are no leads to pursue. I can live with losing ¬£280 but what angers me is that they done this to thousands of people and I estimate they‚Äôve made about ¬£3 million as a result. They‚Äôre probably in Africa by now in their mansion paid for from this fraud / theft living the high life.,0

"Virgin Media ignored a cancellation letter from my mother when moving into an old folks home, even though the initial contract had ended.

I ordered on the 26th of November and still haven't received my goods.,0
"Not only is there coverage very intermittent but even the offers they push are not backed up by reality or working systems- i.e. I keep getting emails on offers linked to partnership with O2 and I cannot even get onto the app using my Virgin Media login!
They send me emails that my broadband speed has improved but we still have black out periods in service and we are definitely not seeing any improvement in speed.
Perhaps if they spend less on marketing budget sending out spam that does not deliver what is promised and focused on their core services, people would be happier with what they deliver!",0
"I just called to order a 2nd TC box. It took 1 hr 12 minutes! Emily was nice enough, but clearly she is required to upsell, which led to the very extended call. I literally had to plead (more than once) 'please do not try to sell me more stuff - I just want a 2nd TV box. The big problem is that she mostly tried to upsell bandwidth from 250MB to 350MB - but the bandwidth I get is rubbish - never exceeds 25MB (10% of what I am paying for) on speed tests. Why would I pay for more of something that I am not getting anyway. I appreciate Emily can not do anything about the rubbish bandwidth, but there is a real disconnect between what is sold and what is delivered.",0
I haven't received my phone! I've received an email saying it had been delivered and nothing has been delivered.

"3 attempt to get a Xiaomi mi 11 lite 5g after 2 wrongs phone.

I keep it just because is a good value for the money I spent!!

But still they deliver the wrong phone!

No I didn't receive the correct Phone now!

I did decide to keep the wrong Phone cause I'm fed up of dealing with the stores and your colleagues.!!

"Terrible experience with Vodafone
I was quoted and agreed on a Broadband Deal
Vodafone has for 3 consecutive months charged a higher amount for the service
If you don't pay the bill in full you are charged a penalty
I have spoken to 5 customer service agents over the last 2 months who have guaranteed to change my bill and nothing has changed
I would not trust this company again
√âdit Updated 22/12/2022
It has taken 5 attempts to ""get to the bottom"" of this issue
The agent tried to call me back twice and neither time did my phone ring or show a missed call
I received 2 business calls after these messages and they connected perfectly
I will try these links in the hope the excess charges are reimbursed
This has very an incredibly time consuming and pointless experience to date",0
"I ordered a phone which I was then told in an automated email would be delivered to my OLD address. There seemed no way to change this, so I immediately phoned you up, only to be on hold listening to the same 5 songs for an hour and then the call was disconnected with no warning as you apparently all knock off at 6.00.

I phoned the next day and you were unable to sort it out, the only option was apparently to completely cancel the order (which was already out for delivery). Pretty amazingly poor to be honest.",0
"Woe, woe, thrice woe. Yet again the internet speed delivered is nowhere near what is boasted by this company. The constant need to call and have service restored is becoming tiresome. When challenged that the service is well below what the contract states (contract 125 Mbps- actual 19 Mbps) the best that can be done is to reset the router then offer a new contract on my mobile! Pardon, I thought we were dealing with the internet package, my bad. This game has been played out several times now. The service provider chokes off the service then attempts to upsell on to a new package. After a brisk discussion within 24 hours the sevices is 'restored', to the original package. Until a few months pass and the game starts again.",0

"Have a monthly Sky Sports pass, one of the main reasons being to watch Red Button EFL games via the Now TV 'bonus streams'.

Now TV were completely dismissive when I raised this and I'm out of pocket by ¬£10 (and missed the opening goal as I was trying to sort this out). Expensive and not delivering what I paid for.",0

Even told them we're and what the problem is. The same thing happened last month. I suppose like all other people when we had the covid work from home time everyone thought great I get paid for sitting around doing nothing. And now people have to go back to their job and have to work for their money they don't like it. When you talk to them you just go around in circles with the same bog standard reply. customer service is crap. We as customers are paying for a service which you are not supplying. We pay your wages.
BT YOU NEED TO SORT YOURSELFS OUT.",0
After another phone call to customer service this morning it turns out that my appliance has been returned to stick and re sold. I had a text last week saying it was in repair and I would be contacted in 3 days. As I heard nothing I rang today. It must be illegal to sell MY appliance and not contact me. I am now getting a full refund and as compensation I will get my ¬£10 delivery cost. How can this happen?? I‚Äôm not sure it is even legal for you to do this.,0

"UPDATE 2: Don't waste your time with this company! Contacted them via messenger (as requested in the reply below) 5 days ago now and its just a nonsense of back and forward. Giving up now. Obviously wanted to join Shell as I was supposedly going to be saving money but I have literally wasted hours of my life (first signing up 78 days ago) trying to become a customer that there will no longer be any savings.

UPDATE: I checked with my current provider and they informed me there is absolutely no way they would block a transfer...so who's talking nonsense?

One of the worst customer services I have ever dealt with. First signed up for broadband 7th October, its now 8th December. After a month and having heard nothing from them I waited in there ridiculously long queues just to have the call drop when someone answers (this is something that has happened on a regular basis). After being passed about the lady told me there had been an issue and the current provider was not allowing the transfer. She had no explanation as to why no one from Shell had bothered to get in touch. The call handler said she would follow the case and make sure it went through this time. Fast forward another month and I have had to call in again to tell them just to cancel the contract.

I would like to add that all the people I have talked with have been lovely there just seems to be a serious system failure when it comes to keeping customers informed. Literally not had a single piece of communication from them since my sign up date.

Why should it be me that has to waste my life in queues to try and become a customer. Communicate with your customers it might be an easy way to get and retain them.",0
"Entertainment pass price increased from ¬£5.99 to ¬£9.99 now. But when you cancel, they give you an 'offer' of ¬£6.99 for three months. How is this an offer paying ¬£1 a month more.

Not only has the price gone up, but they also introduced ads.
Bad points:
You have to pay extra to get HD and 5.1 sound
You have to pay extra to get rid of the ads.
You have to pay extra to stream on more than one device at the same time.

Other streaming services include all of the above as standard.

The app on the Amazon fire stick is not user friendly. Every so often when you open the app, it crashes. Sometimes your 'watch list' disappears. If you haven't watch a program from the 'continue watching' list in a while, it disappears.

If you want to watch on your computer, you have to download another piece of software, you can't watch it through the browser.

There are however, some good programmes on there, but there are also many more good programmes on Netflix and Prime video, which is a lot cheaper, and you don't get ads.

I have cancelled my subscription and wont be re-joining unless the ads are removed and prices are more inline with the other steaming services.",0
"I have been a 3 mobile customer for years.

Last week I used the chat function to enquire about the price of a new phone, in the end they didn't have the phone available.

After a week I found out that my plan has suddenly added without my consent to the existing amount for nearly 20¬£ per month!

What a SCAM company! Never trust this company!

Time to leave this appalling phone company.",0
"I got Now tv as a gift, it came with free movies and free entertainment for 2 months.

"Don't buy from this company!!! They do not deserve any stars - one is tooooooo generous. They are a dishonest, cold blooded, money grabbing company (the word company to too generous). My daughter placed an order in 28/12/20, the promised delivery date was the first week in January, then moved by another 10 days, then said that it would arrive mid-February! At this point exactly a month later 28/1/21 we requested a refund, which they said it was said but that it would take 7 - 10 working days, 11 days later, still no refund and they moved it to another 10 days. It is now March 25th 2021 and they have said that the refund would not arrive until Mid-May! My daughter needed it to access her A level support school work - online! I tried Resolver, which appeared to get a quick answer from them, but still failed. They go from which order? We can't find this, to oh, sorry due to lockdown and banking system we cannot refund the money. Today I resorted to going to my bank and making a refund claim via Visa. Nationwide was fantastic.

After multiple follow-ups and spending hours at a time on multiple chats and calls BT has still not given me my referral bonus as they promise. Feels like they run a ponzi scheme.

"Very poor company. DO NOT USE. Failed to provide a refund for my cancelled order, causing much frustration and anxiety. Simply not fair, nor acceptable. Deadlines for promised refunds came and went without payment. Tantamount to lying. Not sure how companies such as Quick Mobile Fix can get away with this type of behaviour. Not having a telephone contact number may help? I am sure many others will be in the same position as myself. If this is the case, please contact your bank ASAP.",0

I had to drive to the restaurant myself to collect my order at 9pm where my food had been sitting there for ages no delivery driver collected it. They are refusing to give me a refund and I asked multiple times for my transcript of my chat with Deliveroo which they have failed to provide.",0
"Words cannot express my utter disgust for this company at this point. This is my 3rd update on this shambolic experience with this company, do check back through my previous Currys reviews for the rest of this ongoing saga.

So basically, ordered a ¬£400 mobile phone from Currys/CPWH, next working day delivery to the store, just about a month later and still no phone. Two weeks later and after multiple visits to the store and phone calls I finally get it out of them that the phone is missing and all the times I was told it's just a postal delay because DPD are helping with the royal mail strikes was just to fob me off.

On the 29th of December, I was told that they have contacted DPD and they need to have an investigation into what has happened to the parcel. 2 weeks later that investigation still hasn't taken place and DPD inform me that they are waiting on information from Currys. Yes, I actually tried to sort this out with DPD directly as nothing is happening with Currys.

Either someone at Currys or DPD has probably stolen the phone and I just can't get a replacement. I was also told I can't even get a refund until I receive the phone. At this point, I'm thinking my only option is to launch a dispute with my credit card company or trading standards or even small claims court because Currys isn't doing a damn thing.

I want compensation for this and that compensation will run into the hundreds for the amount of my time I have had to spend on something akin to The Epic Of Gilgamesh.

Sort this out, for the love of god.

Continue to chase an incorrect invoice of more than ¬£800 even with evidence provided of cancellation within 14 days. They even had the audacity to apply the balance to my credit file. Absolute crooks!.. See you in court BT,0
Avoid at all cost absolute worst provider out there. The service is poor and you‚Äôll be lucky to stay connected for more than 10 min on 4 bars. Just to top it off they Capp your data abroad in Europe. Can‚Äôt wait to go back to ee after this contract is done,0
"If I could give a minus figure I would. Pure delays, failed promises and considering this is a communication company, they have the worst communication of them all. I wish I had listened to the reviews before continuing with Vodafone, only fortunate thing is that they didn‚Äôt turn up so I am not stuck with them. Please take these reviews seriously, they are all accurate, also most of them are within the last couple of weeks so these issues at right now and not months or years ago!!! Will never use and definitely not recommend Vodafone to anybody, avoid at all costs. Poor customer service, failed on the promises. Actually they are not promises just pure failures on offering their service. I wouldn‚Äôt even take their deal if they offered it for free!!!",0

Initially very good. The website was easy to navigate and purchase through. The product was sent in very good time. Unfortunately the courier delivered the product to the wrong house and were unable to retrieve it. I contacted Ghd through their online customer services twice within a week and I'm still waiting on a response. It seems to me that their spam emails work more than their customer service staff do! Sorry for the bad review ghd but this is Unfortunately how I found/still finding! The experience.,0
