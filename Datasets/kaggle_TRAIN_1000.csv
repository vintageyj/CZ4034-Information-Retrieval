"Simple, fast and true to their word.",1
"Ask when my contract expired. Had only begun in May and I asked if it was a good contact to which he replied yes. However, he then went into the details of how good my contract was and when I should look at renewing it again in Nov or Dec of 2023. He was specific and knowledgeable and this he shared with me and I'm hoping for another ""good"" contract in the year to come. Thank you",1

I made my choice and was able to purchase it that evening without any problems, the whole process taking less than two minutes. It was despatched the next morning with full tracking details and it arrived the following day. Very well packed and exactly as described. Faultless transaction from start to finish!",1
"Website is very simple to use and still provides every bit of information you need, fantastic tracking system that tells you what stage your build is at. Also fantastic build calculator which notified me that I didn't need the PSU I selected and selected one good enough for my build at a less price SAVING me money rather then other companies out there that will get their most from you",1

"Do not buy a phone from Carphone Warehouse.
CW lost my phone after I took it in for a warranty repair on 9 September (yes, 7 weeks ago and the issue is still not resolved). Numerous visits, unanswered phone calls and emails later they have not said sorry and tell me they ""don't compensate for life"" (ie the stress, inconvenience and time that they have caused me for something that was in no way my fault). Apart from the ladies in the shop in Gravesend (who were understanding and helped as much as they could) the customer service has been awful.",0
Available for delivery and received exactly when advised. A very efficient service and friendly helpful delivery man üòÄ,1
"Great communication, speedy delivery
Definitely recommend their service :)",1
Kept upto date with every step highly recommend,1
"Please avoid this company at all costs & do not purchase from them or like many others you will be left angry & frustrated. I ordered an iPhone 11 at the start of December 2020 & then had to cancel the order, which I did within 24 hours. I was told my refund would be processed within 14 working days.
I contacted them in early January 2021 & was told due to Covid-19 they would not be able to provide my refund until 3rd February. It never happened, so I contacted them again & was told it would be by 3rd March...it never happened. I'm now awaiting a date of 30th April, but I know it won't be processed. I'm in the process of providing my bank with all the details so they can hopefully resolve this for me.",0
"Perfect, thanks. Garry J and Shaun F were really friendly. Brought the cooker right into the kitchen.
Took the old one away too.
Thank You.",1
Mazuma quoted me a fair price for my phone and paid me on the day they received it.,1
The website is clear and the buying process straightforward. Product was delivered promptly. The price was fair.,1
"Quick, easy, excellent quality!
Totally recommend.",1
This was my first purchase from Wex and I‚Äôve been delighted with the service and support they‚Äôve offered.,1
"I was originally told my tv would be returned to me within a week as it was a very simple repair job, ended up taking two months and every time I asked for an update someone told me they would look into it and never came back to me. Worst overall customer service experience I've ever had. There is even a guarantee of a replacement if the repair takes more than two weeks on your website which you refused to honour due to covid. If you're not going to honour it you've had months to remove it from your website. Absolute joke from start to finish would not recommend to anyone and would avoid using again at all costs.",0
Good price with very sppedy delivery. Excellent information about suitable RAM and instalation instructions.,1
"first class advice, first class goods, first class service",1
"There was an error with an order. Used the chat bot and got a full refund organised in 5 mins. Good customer service
Second order was perfect and just what I needed.",1

"Really excellent customer service, product knowledge and willingness to help.",1
Easy ordering quick delivery excellent,1
"Always had my bill date as 23rd of every month since the start of my contract, I then received texts from them 2 month ago saying I would be charged late payment if I didnt pay by the 20th, I contacted them and they'd changed payment date without even asking or letting me know, I asked them to change it back and they said they had. Then last month I had the same thing saying I'd be charged late payment fee if it wasn't paid by the 5th so they had changed it again without my permission, I had to contact them again and they finally changed it back to 23rd like it had been for the last yeah and half but I have still been charged late payment fees. Had loads of problems from the start of this contract. As soon as my contracts up I will be changing networks, also the upgrade deals for existing customers are terrible much cheaper elsewhere",0
"So easy, saved me so much time using bark
All the traders contacted me
Great experience",1
Fantastic service. Quick dispatch and installation guide provided. Will be using them again. üôÇ,1
Great experience dealing with Wex. Incredibly helpful staff.,1
"How can we make our service the worst on the market currently? 720p / 1 screen unless you pay a premium every month, and enough adverts to choke a horse.",0
Always great service from WEX. Speedy delivery and great website experience.,1
Bought a fridge freezer online from Hughes to be delivered on a specific day. Was given a time slot of 1730 to 1930. At 1731 on day of delivery the tracking updated to say ‚Äúdelivery unsuccessful‚Äù. Contacted delivery company to ask why and apparently route was cancelled as driver had reached maximum legal driving time. Why was my delivery scheduled for after this time?! Earliest date to rebook was 5 days later! Contacted Hughes as well and they gave excuses of ‚Äúdelivery date is an estimate‚Äù and ‚Äúdaylight hours are short‚Äù?!? Why schedule deliveries when they know they won‚Äôt meet them?! And also schedule them for when it‚Äôs too dark for them to work?! Also in the winter they must only be delivering between 10am and 3pm while it‚Äôs light enough if that is the case?! Won‚Äôt be ordering again.,0
"WOW! How friendly and helpful was Ravi and his assistant. Not only did they arrive on time, but they carried the freezer round to the back door ( as the front was blocked). They brought it inside and positioned it exactly where we wanted it. We wish all our delivery guys were as helpful as this. Thank you.",1

New to the app but so far, so good",1
"I bought a Samsung phone on their website, when the phone was still under warranty it started to freeze a lot - so I took it to their shop to repair and after 2 long weeks the phone came back worse! After changing the motherboard on the handset they did something wrong and the device is not longer consider a safe device by google or samsung. So I am not allowed to do any payments on my phone or install any apps that demand a security process - even Netflix doesn't allow me to use it without the certification. Their only solution is to send it again to the same repair centre that did the wrong before. Even Samsung doesn't know how to fix their doing - and they told me how Carphone Warehouse is known for doing really bad repairs. I use my phone to work on daily basis and I have already lost almost a month of pay because of this mess and they refuse to replace the phone - only offer taking my phone for more two weeks of repair. How to trust them again?",0
"Excellent customer service, my first order arrived incorrect but after one email the order was redone and sent out free of charge.",1
Waste of time on phone over 2hours nothing didn't speak to anyone to arrange a visit by engineer Don't use this company,0
"Super quick and easy. I contacted TeamKnowhow when I broke my phone and my local Carphone Warehouse store had closed down.
I was on the phone for about 5 mins and the replacement phone was ordered for the next day.
The courier turned up and we swapped my old broken phone for the replacement phone.

Easy!",1
Straight forward ordering and excellent delivery - very impressed.,1
Absolutely disgusting company!!! Sold me an iPhone 7 last October after 1 month I had to send it back in as the signal kept going. Sent it got it back after 4 weeks. Again 3 weeks later I had to send it back to be repaired again! They told me they was substantial water damage to it and wanted me to pay ¬£70!! Clearly this phone was damaged before we recieved it as my daughter only used it to walk to and from school!‚Ä¶ I reluctantly paid the ¬£70‚Ä¶ 6 weeks later still no phone returned‚Ä¶ they sent me an email stating the exact same thing and that I need to pay yet another ¬£70!!‚Ä¶ I refused and asked them to send my handset back as it was‚Ä¶ this was the end of February 2021‚Ä¶.. email after email of asking where my device was‚Ä¶ the last bit of communication I had from them was July!!‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs now December 2021 so 12 months after having my phone and they still have not returned it!!! Never ever will I buy from this site and I‚Äôll make sure anyone I know doesn‚Äôt either!,0
"Ordered food at 7 pm and waited for an hour then a message popped up that food was delivered on time without delivery. We've contacted them through live chat and the only solution they could offer was a refund. By this time, it was already 8.30 pm and we only needed food, not a refund. The customer service assistant and the manager repeated the same excuse 100 times but had no desired to sort out the issue. Do not waste your time and use other options for delivery. This review took an extra few min of my precious time. Not happy at all.",0
so my first time with mobile phones direct didn‚Äôt start of so well‚Ä¶.my application was successful and my phone was sent out..11/10/22 on the same day they recalled the phone back apparently 3 network didn‚Äôt connect and was told my application was to close..5 days after i received a letter from 3 welcoming me obviously they did connect my phone that i didn‚Äôt receive..after calling and emailing to see what was happening ANDY from customer services was the most amazing person ever and got quick onto my case and gave me the best news yesterday that finally my phone is on its way üòç excellent customer service off this guy wish they was all like him! 5 stars just for you! and thank you once again,1
Samir M. was very helpful sorted out the details immediately 5star,1
"Wish I could give a sub-zero rating. The service was not only bad but straight up outrageous. BT advertised their Fibre 1 to be available in my flat and made me transfer my landline to them in order to place an order for the broadband service. Just for me to find out after the line had been transferred that I can only get the very basic package, on which the speed was 90% slower than the fibre connection? Called then three times inbetween but it seems like nobody knows there what they‚Äôre talking about. I raised the complaint and first it was automatically closed without even contacting me and could only resolve the issue by raising the complaint again? Absolutely horrible broadband service, astronomical prices, awful value and terrible customer service. Easily the worst company I‚Äôve ever come across!!!",0
"I have been using Mr Memory for years. Never let you down, quality products, great advice and easy to use website. Top service.",1

"If you‚Äôre considering using carphone warehouse to sign up to Virgin Broadband don‚Äôt bother! Arrangements were made for installation to take place but the engineers didn‚Äôt arrive and having waited in all day we later found out that it hadn‚Äôt been booked. Eventually managed to get it sorted by discussing directly with Virgin and all in all we were without WiFi and a phone for 3 weeks. Was promised compensation of ¬£100 but have so far only received ¬£50, despite numerous calls and visiting the store, and this going back to October!",0
Communication arrangements for delivery right up to driver calling to say he was there,1
"I would give no stars if possible.
Been without a broadband connection since 23/12/20 due to Now messing up my order.
Customer service is useless, still no idea when I will connected, life is too short for such bad service, use someone else...",0
"I ordered an item that said ""In store, collect today"". Great, I wanted it today and i'm off work so I ordered it. Order comes through: stock will be delivered to store on 25th (2 days from today). What? It said it was in Store collect today? Check website again, still says in stock in store collect today. So I contact the web chat person, webchat person (Yashika) lies to me, tells me it's in stock collect today. Ask her why does my email then say Wednesday 25? She says my payment has to be verified and cleared. I'm using a currys voucher for the entire amount.

Absolute kafkaesque shop that I will not go back to ever again now. Nothing ever in stock, webchat people lie to you. Website says in store and available, but for some reason my order will be delivered to the store 2 days from now? Absolute disgrace.",0
"Why is everyone at BT not capable of doing the job that they have been given.

Joe, please explain why restrictions have been placed on Tracy's Webex account???

Joe you said that our voice cloud service would be sorted out and you put Conor in charge of dealing with this.

Please explain why only 2 of the 3 users are working so far???? Why did you not follow up??????

Marjorie can you please explain why it is so difficult ton get what we pay for???? You are the customer service manager after all!

Marjorie please can you get your team of first graders to follow the email from Cisco and get the account for Tracy Francis working.

I'M TIRED OF HELPING ALL OF YOU TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO YOUR JOBS AND I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE CHAIRMAN OF BT WHY I HAVE BEEN TASKED WITH THIS ADDITION ROLE?

I didn't sign up to this and there is a cost of my time which which I would like compensation for.

"The product was good but after I used it I found another comparable hose for less money than I paid you. The other product also included two jubilee clips and a water inlet hose. So your item, the quality was good but price was too high. Hence 3 stars.

eSpares refunded me some money on their price promise. This has reassured me that it is a company to warrant a better rating. I increase my review from 3 stars to five, thank you.",1
I‚Äôve been struggling with a problem with my emails. I called BT and the last two staff I spoke to couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful and resolved the problem. It was a complicated issue and took time and patience. Many thanks,1
Absolutely amazing I placed an order to rent a phone got accepted yesterday and I received my phone today Absolutely quick process thank you,1
Recently bought a Sony Bluetooth turntable but had a problem with the set up. I took it back to the shop where Damien the manager took care of me. I said I wasn‚Äôt particularly happy with the product. Damien said no problem and recommended an Audio Technics replacement. More expensive but a vast improvement. Superb. Thank you.,1
"Great price with prompt delivery, excellent product and packaging.
Could not fault instructions on how to replace part.

"If I could give this company a zero out of 5 I would. Terrible service. Ordered a meal. Driver claims he called me, I called his number back that was listed on the site. He could not speak English. Sent message he left on my doorstep but never did. The driver lied, their customer chat line did not help. Kisha Mae disconnected me, so did Stacey Ann. Asked for a refund and they said it was a false delivery that I was not there when I was. Instructions of how to find us was listed in the special instructions section with my mobile number, but as the driver could not speak English he did not follow these. He claims he delivered and they are charging me. But I never got the meal. Terrible after care from there customer service team. They are charging me for a non delivered meal, no customer service. And a driver who does not read instruction and call the mobile number provided. I called the driver on his mobile he hung up on me and then removed his mobile so I could not see it. I will logging an official complaint tomorrow with their quality assurance team. But my advise to all those out there is never use deliveroo.",0
"I am as of right now, extremely frustrated and disappointment with the customer service from PC Specialist. Like many of the other bad 1-star reviews here, my problems seem to be eerily similar in substance.

I ordered a custom laptop on which it's first day of use had a technical problem with the RAM cards causing the screen to completely break. This is a 'known fault' I am told, and an easy fix to carry out myself which I was not prepared to do as it wouldn't be covered by warranty if something did go wrong.

I had to create an RMA and send it off which was a joke in itself as when the delivery driver pulled up on my drive I physically watched him lean across his van and took a picture of the house and then upload it saying there was no one in. The irony being that you could see me in the picture standing in the window and by the time I had got downstairs, the driver had gone. When I rang DPD they cited 'he's running late so cant come back to you and that's the reason you were missed out.' Obviously this was completely obscene.

This was meant to be my new work laptop so it was extremely annoying having to wait 2 weeks (when it eventually did get collected properly) for it to be returned to me, all the while using some old piece of tech that was absolutely awful (but at least it actually worked...) When it did return I used it for maybe 4 days and then the exact same problem happened again. The screen glitch.

Upon ringing the customer service number I get told 'The RAM must have been knocked in transit' Again, it's an easy fix to do it yourself BUT no we wont cover the warranty if you break it. I don't want to send it off again because as I mentioned previously, this is my work laptop and I have transferred all my work across to it and sending it off again would annoy not only me but also my company. I asked if they could send a technician out to do it, no, they don't do that. They said if I wasn't prepared to do the repair myself I would have to send it back in but I asked what would stop the exact same situation arising again when I got it back the next time? The answer is nothing, so I ask what is the point then?

I then decide I need to return this because there's obviously a problem with the build quality from this place even after having spent ¬£1,800 on this laptop. Apparently I cant return it because it was ordered with a business card as it says in the T's and C's. Why? Why can't I return the faulty piece of equipment that you have supplied? Which I then gave you the chance to fix and it still haven't?

This all put's me in an extremely frustrating position and a completely horrible experience from when I first turned it on, right the way through to where I find myself now. Absolute shambles",0
Prompt delivery and parts were as hoped for,1
"Allegations
Told VM to end the contract for Feb 7th- They cut me off January 9th- since then no connection, Call center in Inda, got a formal complaint from the family- VM did the investigation and merely offered feedback to the agent. Also closed my account.
So we have a breach of contract and consequential losses. Also, the Subject Acess request was not Acknowledged so a complaint to the Information Commissioner's office. SO IT'S THE SMALL CLAIMS COURT. Beth and co your sound bites are laughable and meaningless, and so transparent. So my guidance to you bunch look at the Truspoilet site have a group think what is the common denominator??. A big hint it's not the customers",0
"I've been going to Richer Sounds for all my AV & home cinema needs for 20 years.

Partner's mum needed to upgrade her old LG TV so I suggested Richer Sounds instead of her usual big electrical retailer.

Excellent service as always, free sound bar included and we were even given a discount/refund as the TV price had dropped between the day we paid and the day we collected.

A very nice surprise and another reason why I'll always choose them first and recommend them to others. Cheers!",1
"Febuary 2021 I paid this company nearly‚Ä¶
Febuary 2021 I paid this company nearly ¬£200 to repair my phone, was a simple screen repair, or so i thought. week later i receive an email saying phone cannot be repaired due to them not being able to source the parts ( its a 1 year old phone)!. the phone was returned to me.

2 weeks went by i heard nothing else, so I emailed them to ask where was my refund!. I heard nothing for over a week, they said that due too covid they were short on staff and that they would look into it!. Guess what..... yes you guessed it, I heard now't!!!

my last email was sent in march requesting an up date as to my refund they said i would be paid on or before May 13th 2021.........today is the 16th of May 2021 and still no refund.

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY

I WOULD RATHER BANG ME WEDDING TACKLE REPEATEDLY IN THE POST OFFICE DOOR THAN USE THIS SHOWER AGAIN",0

"If I could rate 0 I would! Please save yourself time and don‚Äôt bother with talk talk. We went with them only to immediately have a fault. It took a month to resolve. Then 10 days later we had another fault and it is over a month later and this is not resolved. We have spent HOURS on the phone to talk talk and by their own admission we have been continuously lied to by agents. Their engineers have apparently been, left no notes and no one can tell us what‚Äôs going on. 10 days services in nearly 4 months is appalling. We have been promised refunds, compensation and the all important manager call back. We NEVER get a call back and we call in every other day for updates. I can never recommend talk talk. Please avoid and save yourself the stress and frustration.",0

PS5 absolutely brilliant got one for the hubby at last! Brilliant company I‚Äôve bought a few items can‚Äôt fault them THANK YOU,1
"Great prices, excellent service, helpful and friendly staff",1
"Easy to order, delivered on time well packed",1
Great support for a problem that was not even their fault. Everything is solved.,1
"Great calendars. Good, reliable service for my Christmas gifts year after year.",1
"Out of stock everywhere, but Marks had what I wanted and at a reasonable price. Well done.",1
Mazuma did exactly what it said it would. The process is easy. Just select your phone and spec. Say how good or bad it is and select post method and away you go. Think it took less than a week from visiting website to getting money in my account. Nice and easy,1
"I would 100% recomend pc specialist especially for people who are new to the world of pc's. The website is easy to use and when you are done configurating your build they tell you if it is all compatible and if you have some componenets that are unnecessarily powerful for the build so you do not waste any money components. The only complaint i would have is that it does take a long time to arrive (nearly a month), however I belive this is not down to pc specialist themselves but rather the fact that it is hard to get the parts at the moment. Also when the pc does arrive they send you an email on how to set it up so you do not make any mistakes. Amazing company for people purchasing their first pc.",1
ordered two calendars and am still waiting for delivery. been well over the estimated delivery date. you have resent it (apparently) but im still waiting for it to come. not buying from here again,0
"Very helpful staff , easy process over the phone to get what I want ordered and swift delivery !
Keep up the good work üòÉ",1
Item delivered quickly and well packaged. Condition as described.,1
"Easy to access, easy to choose what you would like, easy to order, orders arrive on time, sometimes even before, if there is a problem easy to solve, and very helpful in doing so",1
"I had a technical problem that caused my network to fail. I suspected the router.
I telephoned TalkTalk and got through within a minute. The auto answering directed me smoothly to the call centre who spent a considerable amount of time testing the line and equipment remotely whilst talking with me through the process.
The problem was the router and they said they would despatch a new one immediately. This arrived the following day at 11:00 delivered by Yodel",1
"Good price, very quick delivery. Item was well packaged.",1
This is the worst company I've ever had to deal with you can look at my previous complaints about there incompetentence. I've since changed broadband provider yippieüòä but I've tried about 6 times spent over 1 and a half hours onto these clowns trying to cancel my broadband even after numerous calls to these I'm still getting emails to contact them to cancel or else I'll be fined? No wonder why these are disliked so much absolute terrible company all round from there service to there scheduling nothing gets passed to the next person then you've to start all over again same process to do the one thing you've asked them to do. STEER WELL CLEAR OF THESEüëé,0
This my 3rd contract with mobile direct never had any problem üëç,1
My order never arrived I have to wait another few days until I can request a refund,0
HAVE DEALT WITH THIS COMPANY FOR QUITE A WHILE AND THEY ARE ALWAYS GREAT,1
Item not delivered after three weeks. Rubbish,0
"Absolutely shocking company. Ordered 2 products on 25th November. Still awaiting dispatch. Says it would be with me between 5-10 days from order, when I call them they continuously say there is a slight delay, and refuse to let me cancel. They don‚Äôt respond to emails to the Customer Services even though it says I will get a reply within 2 days. I am in the process of disputing the order, but avoid this company like the plague.",0
"Great deal on my new Samsung s22, great service, super quick delivery, all in all 5 stars thankyou.",1
"All good, sent an item back because I had ordered the wrong thing. Refunded without a problem.",1
Great prices on tools very fast delivery as I‚Äôm a very busy decorator/ sprayer,1
Im so excited to be on this new journey! I a love this brand and would recommend it it everyone looking for amazing product,1
"Terrible instructions for SSD upgrade. Did not relate to make of SSD supplied. Not clear which clone software to use. Missing some sort of passcode if we use Acronis - normally supplied by the SSD manufacturer.
Sent screen shots of problem area and incorrect solution offered. Only solution offered was send it back if still a problem!! Sorted it out with help of chum. Value added by Mr Memory zero, and price was not good either. Sorry.",0
"Watching on a smart TV is terrible. The app crashes, buffers incessantly, displays a poor quality, and shows a blinding bright white screen while it's loading. Watching on PC is even worse. You can't stream directly from their website and are prompted to download the NOW TV Player instead. But if you want to watch something on the NOW TV Player you have to find it using the website! The constant back and forth is such an inefficiency and a waste of time. Definitely the worst streaming platform out there. Avoid avoid avoid.

Edit: They've now decided to run 30 second ads at the beginning of certain programmes even though you pay for the service. Less of a streaming platform and more of an online scam. Massive thumbs down.",0
"Haven't recieved the delivery, normally would be happy to wait but I cant even track the parcel :(",0
"Wouldn‚Äôt work on most of my devices and when I started a new account they reactivated my old account and charged my 4 times what I should have been!
Do not use!!!",0
"Fantastic service, easy to use website. Good response to my follow up query. Recommend checking them out.",1
Excellent service come within 2 days of ordering on 1 of the busiest time of the year..,1
"The photo print has thin lines at the bottom part of the picture, 7 photos are damaged. The company should have checked it first before sending the items ordered to thee customers.",0
If I could give zero stars I would. Ordered the GHD on 29th November and expected it within 3-5 days. It was not dispatched until 9th December which was frustrating but given the busy shopping period I was understanding. Hermes emailed to say they had the package and would deliver it. I then received an email from Hermes claiming it was delivered but it had not been. I tracked it and realised that it had not been signed for and it had been left in a ‚Äúsafe place‚Äù - given that my front door is on a busy Main Street I never ask for anything to be left in a safe place. Hermes then sent me a black picture as proof of delivery. I understand this is an issue with the courrier and not GHD however I have now complained to both Hermes and GHD and have received no response and still have no GHD despite paying for it 2.5 weeks ago.,0
"Great service, at a decent price",1
"Hi.
Perfect ! Great product at a fair. Good communications.
Arrived on time.
AAA+",1
The customer service is appalling they don't listen to anything you say and just pass you around to different departments. Finally get to complaint's and they are just as bad. if you want to leave them they make it so difficult. Wouldn't recommend them to anyone.,0
"Their business model relies on the fact that interactions take place remotely. The staff of an actual restaurant would never treat me with the contempt Deliveroo staff treated me after a three hour delay and cold food. This is a revolting, dishonest, contemptible, thieving, parasitic, disgusting organisation. I‚Äôve deleted my account and will be glad to collect my food, and interact with real people in future. Scum.",0
"We wanted to use NowTV wifi for when we moved into our new house. It was due to be installed the day I moved in. Someone came to do it, drilled holes in the wall (so now we'll have to pay our landlord for the damage) and then just...left. Without coming back or telling us what was going on.

To add insult to injury, after this event, they told us they'd be back the following week to install everything. A bit annoying, but fine. The next week came and nobody showed. They sent a text to us saying they'd update us in three weeks. Not install it, just update us on when they would. Bearing in mind two of us work from home requiring an internet connection, this just wasn't feasible. My housemate informed NowTV of this and they told us they'd update us the following week. So we waited. The following week, they told us we'd have to wait several more weeks for another update. They never told us what the actual issue was or why it was taking so long to fix. We were kept in the dark about it even after explaining our situation. We grew tired of the rigmarole so we had to find a different wifi provider so we'd be able to get wifi sooner.

Essentially, I do not recommend NowTV for wifi in the slightest. I couldn't tell you what the wifi connection or speed is actually like, because I never actually used it. But the poor customer service and the drama with the installation was enough for us. I've never left a negative review before for anything, but this was just so frustrating I wanted others to be warned.",0
Excellent customer service from Harmony Carter. Nothing was too much trouble and sorted out my order calmly and professionally. Thank you and well done.,1
Great service yet again from HMV. CD arrived on release date despite a postal strike,1
"Easy to order, arrived quickly. Excellent",1
"First time ordering, efficient and quick delivery. Would recommend.",1
Dispatched and arrived earlier than expected. No issues with the actual product.,1
"Initial contact was very good sales person was very helpful and we like the Brand of Dishwasher we ordered so went ahead. We ordered December 13th and delivery date was initially given as December 16th which would have been amazing.

Its been downhill since then. I got a text on December 14th saying delivery would be delayed until the New Year which I accepted. I contacted Customer Service on Dec 29th to see when in the New Year and they said they had requested the stock be moved and I should get an update in 48 hours to book delivery.

Still nothing as Jan 4th so tried again and got the same answer. Now Jan 6th told request was cancelled and I should get an update over the weekend.

So at this point a 2 day delivery is edging toward a month which obviously isn't good enough but also not keen to start with a new supplier at this stage. Just really poor communication with me and within the business after initial positive experience.

Was promised delivery and install January 10th this has now also failed and I have requested cancellation absolutely abysmal experience.",0
Very easy to use. I like that you can link multiple social accounts in one place and track your commissions. The missions are fun to complete.,1
"Craig D and Feremc
Delivered our new microwave with enthusiasm and were very polite",1
"Absolutely shocking home phone hast been working for 3 weeks, twice they‚Äôve said they will send an engineer out, had to take both days off work, and both times no one showed not even a phone call to let me no what‚Äôs going on, every time I ring them they say the same thing only to be fobbed off again, totally frustrated and angry with this shambles of a company, don‚Äôt even deserve one star!!!! Complete waste of time!!!!!!",0
I mad multiple orders consisting of canvases and personalised calendars and I couldn‚Äôt ask for anything else. Starting from the ease of use of the website to the excellent quality of the goods everything was amazing. This company is one I have recommended to family and friends and one I will definitely e using again,1
"I've been trying to get a response from you guys for 4 days on verifying my purchase and noone is replying to my emails.

Don‚Äôt waste your time with BT anymore guys. They keep delaying the switching on date for months! Waiting for engineers to come to my house for about 2 months now and they extended it for another month! üòÇ And charges me the full price even tho I don‚Äôt wifi in my house because of them!!! Absolutely hilarious company!,0
When my husband asked me what I wanted for Christmas I said I would love some new ghds to replace my old ones that I have had for a number of years I love them the green velvet case is gorgeous can‚Äôt fault them.,1
Don‚Äôt bother. They may be quick to deliver but unfortunately don‚Äôt deliver what you order. Should be called Delivernoooo,0
"Placed order for 3 x Samsung S22 256gb, x pink, 1 x green & 1 x black website stated 1 - 3 days for delivery for each of the colours. Received order confirmations nothing detailed regarding delivery. There was no temporary passwords for an account as stated but made one anyway. Pink phone was stuck in security checks for 24 hours the other 2 were on Pre order awwaiting stock so called in to check if there was a problem with the pink phone. No problem sometimes with multiple phones it takes a bit longer. Checked on delivery status of other 2 phones and was told maximum 3 days and I would have the handsets. Pink phone changed to Pre Order awaiting stock so I called to see if I could change that to a white one which was detailed as in stock for next day delivery. Colour changed and was told I would receive the next day and 19 handsets in stock. Called back later to change the other 2 phones to white at which point there were only 8 handsets in stock but was assured I would recieve all 3 phones next day. No order updates, no dpd notices for delivery so called back next day to check what was going on. Whilst I was on the phone the green now white changed to packing and likewise the black now white did but not the pink now white. Apparently that hadn't been actioned properly so they changed it again and said still 4 handsets all 3 phones would be delivered next day. Got dpd notifications for green / black now white but nothing again for pink now white and that was still on Pre Order. Called again to see what was going on. Was told that the pink now white had not updated so they changed it again and said will get the next day. Green / black now white was delivered at 5.30pm. Both were connected with Vodaphone and existing sim could be used. Didn't get any updates again for pink now white phone so called again next day. White phones were now out of stock so couldn't have one. No colours were in stock so the agent spoke to manager and called me back to say I could have a refurb phone in colour of my choice delivered next day with a ¬£50 compensation payment which would hit my bank in 3-5 days after dispatch. Asked about Samsung cashback and Disney offers with this phone and was told yes it still applied so said OK I'll have a black one. Got order update and in dispatch notice then discovered refurb handsets are not qualifying products for promos so called them back, they were not prepared to compensate me for the lost offers so i cancelled that one. After a lengthy conversation I agreed as my only option to take a Bora Purple 128gb with the ¬£50 compensation presumably delivery next day. Again no order update, no dispatch notice, no Dpd notices and order still on Pink and Preorder. Called back at 4pm was told it will definitely be delivered next day and dpd can send notices upto 11am. So knowing this was just another fob off as it hadn't been processed I waited till next morning and called back again. Again I was told sorry not been processed so I said well I noticed the website says Bora Purple 256gb was in stick for next day delivery so could I change to that handset. Handset was changed again on system and again told delivery would be next day. Waited all evening for updates but nothing again so I placed a new order completely at 6.46am. By 2pm I had the dispatch notice on the new order so I called to cancel the original order. After waiting 1.5 hrs in queue I had received an order update for the original order but stating Bora Purple 128gb not 256gb. When I finally spoke to someone to cancel that order a recall message was sent to warehouse as it had gone to dispatch, I received dpd notice for new order and that went to connection. I waited on the phone to ensure the 128gb was cancelled but it was too late dpd notice received and that also went to connection. Both phones were delivered next day now Sunday. New order had taken 10 hours from placing order to dispatch. Original order a week and loads of changes and hassle and hours on the phone and in the queue. Was told to refuse delivery of 128gb and it would go straight back to them overnight be checked back in warehouse and cancelled and refund for upfront and compensation would be processed. Refused delivery Sunday 11th December, now 15th December and according to dpd tracking still states Snetterton depot? Will be checking on that. Then I notice on my Vodaphone account that my contract is set up for 4 years instead of 2. This is due to 2 connection notices for my number. Also 1 of the other phones the contract hasn't updated. Called MPD again to sort this on Sunday 11th December. Won't cancel connection order for Purple 128 till they have recieved it back and then it will take about a week to process through. Asked them to send a new / amended connection to vodaphone for the other phone that hasn't updated as MPD cancelled it now 15th December still not done. Not good service",0
"Love HMV
You alway do good by me. Thanks",1
Really quick to identify the fault and provide the solution,1
"Fuming is an understatement I was quoted ¬£205, I sent my phone with to small scratches on it to then be told it had more scratches on it then I had originally sent and then quoted a lower price, after back and forth with emails and still not hearing a response or getting my phone back, I will be taking this further a field to trading standards, watchdog and social media platforms. Do not use very unhappy !",0

"**UPDATE**
Received the phone back from CPW today and powered it up only to notice that it does have visible signs of screen burn but I am 99% sure that this was not present before sending it to CPW for a trade in. I am disgusted if this has been damaged while in their possession. I guess I will never know the truth but what I do know is is that CPW don't seem a very reputable company from the reviews I have read. I will never use them again.

I wanted to trade-in my Google Pixel 3a and had a great offer from Carphone Warehouse of ¬£70. I should have known it was probably too good to be true and after reading many other reviews of people experiencing the same issue and I now feel that I am yet another victim of their trade-in deal. They give you a great quote to draw you in - you post your phone off in great condition and fully working order to then receive an email saying that their engineers have found a fault, in this case, screenburn and would you accept ¬£15 or ask for the phone to be returned. I sent my phone to them in A1 condition with no problems, without even a scratch - it was faultless. I have asked for the phone to be returned to me in the same condition that it was sent but I have little hope of hearing anything back from what I have read elsewhere. Utterly appalling behaviour!! Please could a representative of Carphone Warehouse please contact me to resolve this issue before I take matters further and speak to my solicitor. Thank you.",0
"Completely incompetent. I cancelled broadband and phone line and moved to Virgin Media only to find BT sending me a bill for the next quarter as they hadn‚Äôt cancelled my phone line or my broadband.
The reason i moved was that they wouldn‚Äôt reduce the price of my broadband package even though i told them i‚Äôd been made redundant and they were going to charge my a ridiculous amount for leaving early.",0

Ordered a refurbished iPhone from this company. After ordering I found some bad reviews about the company and soon regretted my decision but decided not to cancel the order. The phone arrived on time and In the condition stated. I am very happy with my purchase and would buy from them again.,1
"Very easy to deal with, clear instructions on what to do and the money was in my account the day they received my old phone. Best price for it too.",1
Due strikes items despatched 24/11 were not received until 13/12 but communications and products seemed OK - thanks.,1
"The whole process of ordering and customising the invites was very quick, easy and hassle free. I would use optimalprint again. Thanks",1
"Additional info following Vodafone reply:
I have decided to leave Vodafone as the coverage is terrible. I went back to carphone warehouse and they processed a change from Vodafone to ID mobile. The staff member printed off the Vodafone guidance which was to call them on 191 to request a PAC code which I then enter on IDs website to get my service transferred.
Only Vodafone have cut me off so I can't claim them. Late last night I had a text saying I had to call 191. I can't. I'm cut off.
So I contact the afore-mentioned social media team by message who eventually reply and tell me to.text for a PAC code.
I can't do that.either as I'm cut off.

I've messaged this info back to them and they are ignoring me.

THIS IS WHY I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GIVEN VODAFONE A SECOND CHANCE. THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NON EXISTANT, THEY GIVE CONFLICTING INSTRUCTIONS AND THEN THEY IGNORE YOU.

DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT GO TO VODAFONE UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME.

I'm still.waiting for a response. I'm still cut off. I can't work. I doubt they care.

Didn't even want to give 1 star tbh as they are awful. Got persuaded to switch to them and wish I hadn't.
I currently have no service at all so I can't work.
Tech team slow and spout jargon at you which makes no sense and makes me feel they have no idea.
If not fixed by tomorrow I will be quitting the contract and going back to o2 or ee.
Please please avoid. I was told they'd improved but they haven't. Worse than before if that's possible",0
Nice friendly staff. Gave good advice and opinions. Showed me all my options. No pressure selling. Would recommend to anyone.,1
"Appalling customer service! I recommend that you do not use them!

I purchased a phone which was clearly described as UNLOCKED, however when I put my sim in I got a insert network sim code üôÑFFS!

I contacted them on the Monday (received the phone on the Saturday) and they said they would get me the code in a few days and let me know, Friday rolls around and I haven't heard anything from them! So I had to call them, however they decided to turn their phones off with a automated message saying to email them! Which added to my frustration.

The email I got in response gave me a unlock code, I input the code but it didn't work much to my anger, I contacted them again, but being the Friday I had to wait another weekend, but on Monday they didn't believe me and once again gave me the same code, I had to send photo's proving it wasn't working for them to believe me.

Their phones were still off at this point, so I used messenger, they finally admitted it was the wrong code as they had the wrong IMEI number, so I sent them the correct IMEI number, but again I had to chase them even though they said they would contact me, two weeks had passed by this point.

They then told me that they couldn't unlock the phone, and that was it, no alternatives, no options, just ""we can't unlock your phone"" I was fumming at this point.

They finally turned their phones back on, I got in touch and the customer service operator admitted they lied to me, I asked for the next model up given the inconvenience caused, they refused but offered a lesser phone to add to insult üò°

It was still a good phone and price as I got it in black Friday and it was 'pristine' so I asked if It could be fixed, they said yes, so I sent it back.

But I heard nothing once again, just a automated email saying the phone was received and being checked, then despite contacting them again I still heard nothing on the status of the phone, finally I got a automated email saying I'd been refunded.

So overall absolutely appalling, disappointing, disgusting customer service.

Their website talks about rigerous checks to phones before dispatch etc, but obviously they didn't bother in this case, because I don't see how something so critical to a phones operating could be missed!

At no point did they contact me despite saying they would, I had to do the chasing, they refused to compensate me despite the inconvenience, they didn't believe the unlock code didn't work, just poor poor customer service, not to mention lieing! All this back and forth took nearly a month.

Use at your own risk!",0
Second RAM purchase from Mr Memory. The items arrived promptly and worked as expected. It's been more than 1 year since my first purchase. Very satisfied.,1
"Refused to exchange a product as I was one day out of the returns window, even though the item was not collected (and the purchase completed) until two days after. Total lack of customer care and unwilling to help or listen, completely inflexible. Appallingly rude and uninterested customer service, they will deliberately put you on hold permanently, rather than end the call, so you do not get the opportunity to do the feedback survey at the end of the call.
Will never shop with them again.",0
"I have been with this company for years,recently i became sponsor for Ukranian family ,and when the family arrived i rung this company and i asked them if they have any support for Ukranian families ( in some countries some phone operaters offer some help for Ukrainians ),they ve said no, but they can give me good deal on 1 year contact ,but after 1 month this family decided to move to a relative in another country as the child was struggling alot so ,they dont use the sim card any more so i didnt want to pay something as nobody uses it any more, today i ve rung the company ,explained the situation to staff member,she said that if they cancel the contract ,i have to still pay ¬£146 ( the contact was ¬£16 fee in a month,and I had already paid one month fee so far ) i explained that special circumtances and im only helping others but now they dont live here and i dont want to pay it next 11 months but she didnt want to know about it ,later on i ve spoke to her superviser and he told me the same thing if they cancel it,, i have to pay ¬£146 ,he keeps saying he has no protocol like that and i have to pay it ,it is disappointing that such big company and they can't show any understanding .",0

"I have been on a retainer with one of the UK‚Äôs largest magazine companies for the last four years and as part of that agreement with them I have needed to bite my tongue and keep the peace. Well as of a few months ago the company is no longer a carphone warehouse client and I‚Äôm no longer bound so now I can let the fur fly ! and warn others considering moving their business account to carphone warehouse to think twice you‚Äôll regret it if you put your account with them, they are incapable of upholding the promises made by their sales persons.

I have been in the communications industry for nearly thirty years and managed many mobile phone providers and virtual networks for the companies I have contracted for and in all that time I have never come across a company that displays such arrogance and lack of understanding of their own industry. I have also never felt so strongly to wright such a review to enlighten others to what they might be letting themselves in for.

Communications is carphone warehouse‚Äôs core business however they are so poor at communication it is no wonder that so many problems existed for the entirety of the account. The main office is in Poole Dorset and seemingly headed up by disillusioned people with thick skins who probably pat themselves on the back believing they are doing a good job. They truly have no idea how to run an office much less manage accounts. The operations director will pay lip service and come across as someone who wants to resolve problems but the reality is he is as ineffective as everyone else, worse if you try and make contact with head office he seems to be able to intercept that communication and you‚Äôll end up having to deal with them again. We found it impossible to make contact with anyone outside that office.

One example of the problems were, one day we suddenly had a large number of mobiles that couldn‚Äôt make or receive calls. Having called them to report was told that it needed to be emailed into the account manager. They wouldn‚Äôt hear that it was urgent and people needed their mobiles working. A day later having been already given the mobile numbers effected in that email they wanted to know the numbers effected, DUH! Didn‚Äôt they read the email. They also wanted to know the postcodes of where every handset was when it couldn‚Äôt make a call. Sort of seems a reasonable question but they asked at 5pm on day two nearly twenty hours after the first report and when the email came back on day three at midday all we were told was that they thought all the sims were faulty and should be replaced and was that what we wanted them to organise? Again duh! They are meant to know what to do, we are the customer.

Not being satisfied with their suggestion, also beginning to lose the will to deal with them any more and frankly now looking incompetent to my employer because its gone on for so long without any proper diagnosis or even a sensible approach being adopted, I called network directly and reported the problem. It turned out that all the numbers effected had been blacklisted. All were un-blacklisted within a few minutes and all were again working within the hour, even through we were told it could take up to 24 hours.

After an investigation it turned out someone at carphone warehouse had make a mistake and emailed in the wrong list of IMEI‚Äôs. When challenged directly their initial excuse was they were acting on instructions from someone within the company, and when asked for the proof which they couldn‚Äôt provide they reluctantly owned up to the cockup in their office. We never did get a proper apology nor did we get an answer as to why someone had collated our IMEI‚Äôs together.

On another occasion we had a large number staff attend a conference in Europe. When they landed at Madrid none of their handsets worked. Two days without a working mobile amongst them and that turned out to be roaming wasn‚Äôt enabled. Despite their service manager stating several times in email that roaming is on by default and what ever the problem is it wont be that!. In desperation again we contacted the airtime provider and they resolved the matter quickly. In the mean time carphone wanted to replace the sims, we lost count over the course of the contract how many times they used that excuse for a break down in service, it seems to be their go-to solution, probably because it buys them time to allow a problem to fix its self or at least appears that something is being done. We never had a problem in the term of the contract that required a sim replacement to resolve.

These are just two of the dozens of examples of problems with them and their service, most of the other problems relate to slowness of what they call service, delayed responses and when they finally do respond if you don‚Äôt have to keep onto them it is usually to confirm information they have already been provided. Eventually we stopped contacting them and dealt directly with the airtime provider who was more than happy to help and always resolved matters quickly. Carphone warehouse probably thought everything was fine and had no idea that they had in effect been cut from the process.

It seemed as though they buy time with every email because they have no idea what to do. The attention span is short and the attention to detail is even shorter!. Efficient is not a word within their vocabulary. It is quite clear the general bar is low and the management bar is even lower.

So the bottom line is, avoid them and save your self a lot of time and inconvenience. The deal they do might be amongst the lowest you will receive and for us it was very competitive however in the long run it will cost you time and annoyance and you will end up managing them and your account your self so you might as well do a deal direct with the airtime provider and cut out the circus clowns at carphone warehouse.

Every negative review you will read online about carphone warehouse business is well deserved in our experience.

I‚Äôm now with another company and for a short while carphone warehouse was being considered, 350 mobiles very nearly transferred to their control. Thank god I got there in time.

Clueless warehouse was the nickname we gave to them and they earnt it too !",0

"I ordered a laptop which arrived next day no issues. At the time of purchase my laptop came with a deal, buy this laptop and I get free software. After chasing them up for weeks for my 'free' software it then turned out that the product codes they sent me were already used. So 3 weeks in no 'free' software which at the time was a selling point over the same laptop in AO. No free software later, within a month my laptop stopped charging. Called up their team and they said to go to a store and get team knowhow to look at it. Next day, I go to the store and tell them it's not charging the technicians examined the charging port and said that they are in good condition, many laptops come back with the charging pin bent or broken but mine was was still in good condition (only had it for just over a month now almost 2) sent back to their repair centre and given a date of 15th November (1 week) that I can expect my laptop back. Roll over a week later I call them up for an update on where my laptop is, after spending a while looking for my reference number they tell me its waiting for a part to repair and the part was ordered on 10th November. Ok part is delayed I waited another week. On the 22nd November I tried calling again as I no longer recieved any updates. Same news waiting for replacement part no estimated date. On the 4th week called them again, same answer waiting for a part, so I asked for a refund or replacement, and they said I can go back to the store and get a replacement. So I did just that, went to the store and asked for a replacement. The guy who assisted was helpful, he first tried to find out where my original item was on his system and then failing that offered a replacement, as they dont stock my item in store they had to order it in. So stupidly I said ok order it in. On the item collection note, I wasnt given any time or date as to when I can expect my product to arrive. So after 3 working days I went back to the store and asked where my product. They called warehouse and said it wasnt there and the store hasn't received it the staff checked and I should come back at the end of the week. Went back and still my product hasn't arrived, the warehouse team says my item isnt in their prepaid folder so it has left the warehouse, so at the start of the week I was told it wasnt in the warehouse, at the end of the week it still isnt in the warehouse or even in store. After 5 weeks of waiting in queues and waiting for my product I had enough. For any other customer purchases made online, there is free next day delivery to store, yet my item ordered in store takes a week and still it doesnt arrive. I've waited 5 weeks without a laptop to do my work, without any update and just put on hold over and over again. I will be getting a new laptop and I can assure you that even if I purchase it from currys now it will arrive quicker than the time I had to put into getting my money back, in the future I will try to avoid them and will recommend anyone where possible to avoid them too.",0
Was offered ¬£80 for iPhone 11 which I was perfectly honest that it was faulty... I was offered around ¬£30 on another site! I decided to go against the negative reviews what's worst that's gonna happen its a old phone I don't use any more you know... so glad I ignored the negative side of things sent the phone off Tuesday by Wednesday they had got it by free post by Wednesday afternoon I got my payment of ¬£80... as long as you're perfectly honest about your devices you shouldn't have any issues... all in all very pleased and happy I went ahead with the offer. Thank you,1

"Hello,

I had a bad experience with this company called Richmond TV Installers.

They owner Ali was very rude and scammed me out of ¬£80. I paid him ¬£100 to mount my Tv and that was all smooth sailing. However he did not mount It properly and my tv was to hanging loosely and was too high. So I called him again saying my TV was mounted to high and the tv is hanging.

We both agreed that it would part of his supposed 3 year warranty and their would be no charge for it. He came over and fixed the tv and that was that.

After I got a call from him, he said I owed him ¬£80. However, I denied that because he agreed it would be part of the warranty and there would be no charge for it.

2 days ago, Ali turns up to my house and let's himself in uninvited. He than ran into my door and entered my bedroom. He started to get aggressive and shouted for the ¬£80. I was scared at the time and told him to leave the property otherwise I will call the police. Whenever I mentioned the police he started to get aggressive.

So I gave in and gave the ¬£80 out of fear. After I gave him the ¬£80 I started to record the situation. When I started recording, Ali said I owed him an additional ¬£40. He started to square up to me until he backed of because he saw he was being recorded. That's when he started to leave the property.

Also to be clear:

There wasn't any type of invoice for the ¬£80. But there was for the ¬£100 which was agreed.

Regards

Seb",0

It's very hard to navigate to somewhere you can complain. When I eventually found somewhere to ask for a refund, the chat just cut out after 5 minutes of waiting for them. There has been no reply to my email. Very poor customer service. Beware purchasing Sky sports through them, as it is missing lots of content.",0

"This has got to be the worst broadband supplier ever. I have spent hours trying to cancel my home broadband contract only to be past from customer service agent to customer service agent and given phone numbers to call that only lead back to the original voicemail message so I'm still no better off. As I am in my first 14 days with them I have cancelled my direct debit and taken the modem into the local vodaphone shop.
Even their phone number for complaints takes you back to the original voice mail message so they have got it sewn up so you can never get out of leaving them,,, let them take me to court.
PS I have since managed to get through to customer service and been told my contract is closed and I have taken screen shots of the full conversation just to cover my back in case Vodafone wants to take this further.",0

very good site to visit to find spares for appliances i needed a new door shelf for a fridge freezer took about 3 mins to find the correct one on site without needing help as it was easy to navigate to the correct item for me good price too will come back again if need to,1
"Been a customer of Knowhow for a washing machine for over 4 years.
Unfortunately it broke down and started leaking badly on the 27th Feb. I called and registered the issue and was told that an engineer would visit between the hours of 1:30 and 5:50 on 5th March. At 4pm on the 5th my wife received a call from the engineer saying he could not get to the appointment. We were then given another appt for the week after on the 11th.
I called Knowhow and explained and was told that I could get a 7day SLA if I call on the Sunday as the repair had gone over 7 days. I called as per the advise given in good faith and the 7 day SLA was processed. I chased this on the Monday and was told that it had been rejected. Another one was processed and was told we should get the voucher on the 10th. I was to call back again and check. I have been told today that this has also been rejected due to the 7 day SLA not starting from the 5th therefore it would not come into play until the 12th.
I have written to the CEO of Currys and currently have received no response. The fact that this company take your money and then when you need them they move goal posts and let you down is a joke. My disabled Mother is currently doing our washing as there is no launderette near us. Thank you KnowHow for being so bad, this really does show what a poor company is.",0
"Bad service, complaint logged, no resolution.",0
Good service. Phone is excellent and as described.,1
Disgusting service. Called over 20 times now to get issues sorted. Still issues after 12 months of faults. Lied to us constantly and make false promises. BT is the worst company we have ever dealt with,0
Worst customer service ever and no proper response to customers. I think THREE members should know each and every customer are important in business. Customer care members are like there is the owner of the company and to the world moreover won't work and false statements and the false promise if not Three should be ban,0

"Just terrible, my contract came to the end I spent literally over an hour on the phone to get it to not autorenew. Someone didn't process this to stop autorenew. Went abroad for a year and came back to see they'd sold off ¬£11 of debt to a company who issued me a CCJ over this even though the contract should have ended and I didn't even use the phone. Cost me literally hundreds and only found out at a new address when I was traced signing up for an energy company. Would never use them again.

Edit well to reply to that reply I've already complained via email and you gave a sorry not sorry reply! You've cost me hundreds and I know you'd never give a penny back, would never touch you again after an outstanding bill of ¬£11 for services I didn't use after the contract should have ended and you didn't send any correspondence via email to even ask for this ¬£11 before selling it on to be debt collected.",0

Our internet connection has been awful since we first joined Virgin. It‚Äôs slow and it drops out all the time. Customer service is basically non-existent so we can‚Äôt get anyone to fix it. We‚Äôre basically waiting until our contract runs out so we can switch to literally anyone else.,0

Well team knowhow i have never experienced anything like the customer service I have recieved from yourself's I am currently as Im writing this on my 12 call this morning I understand the current crisis we all face in these uncertain times but that does not give you the right to not deal with a damaged TV I recieved from yourself's I paid for a fully working TV not a damaged one!,0
"Richer Sounds matched the Amazon price on the Melomania 1+ earphones I was after, & reserved them for me till next day. Good service from Mike in the Leeds store",1
"Awful experience thus far.

Ordered an item, but it was around ¬£150. My credit card company declined the order and asked for verification. Sure no problem, however it said I should then go ahead and order again.

Fine, but all of a sudden I had two orders processed. Great I'll just return one. However its not 2 days after expected delivery to store. After contacting support they have told me that DPD cannot located the parcel.

I've asked for a refund, and they said no sorry we can't issue a refund until their lost parcel investigation has been completed. Which is a week from now, so a total of 9 days after the expected delivery.

Unacceptable, I'm still trying to get my money back, or the item I paid for.

If you MUST deal with CPW then make sure its directly in store.

Poor experience.",0

Always happy with the experience. Staff ask if help is needed very quickly and everyone is always knowledgeable.,1
"Will pressure you to join and promise all sorts of benefits that do not exist in reality. Had to get new kitchen floor and cupboards after washing machine was installed incorrectly. No support from knowhow and same mistake caused over and over again until an engineer I contacted myself rectified their mistake in 30 seconds. They had connected to wrong, lower water inlet causing flooding and dirty water from sink to flood into washing machine and out onto floor when washing machine door was opened. Failed to spot their mistake after several visits. An alternative engineer from another company was shocked at such a 'schoolboy error'.",0

"I ordered 2 samsung galaxy phones in carphone warehouse's store, during the ordering process we were not told that sim phones cannot be refunded and was told that the delivery will arrive within 2 days. My husband took 2 days off work to stay at home and waited for the delivery and nothing arrived. We then cancelled the order online due to the late delivery and ordered else where instead. We spoke to an online operator and was told the driver did attempt to deliver but that is a lie as no one called up. Its been roughly 2 months now and not only have we not been refunded but up to now carphone warehouse is still attempting to deliver the phones to our address which we keep rejecting. We definitely will never be going back to carphone warehouse. And seeing the lack of responses they have to other peoples reviews, it just shows they don't value customers as much as they say. I hope i get a reply which i highly doubt i will.",0
Fantastic service within this store as always.,1
"This a formal complaint as to the service I have received from NowTV posted here since no1 replies to emails and your chat room can't help!

On several occasions I have been shocked that a well known provider such as yourselves could allow your customer service to be so shambolic. I can recall 2 specific situations where I have attempted to speak to someone regarding being unable to access my account only to be ultimately told there was nothing that could be done. There was no real interest in helping and it did not help that this online messaging, whilst convenient to most, feels highly impersonal and resembles a robotic service at best.

So exhausted am I at having to deal with your services that I do not intend to ramble on about the most frustrating accounts I have had. What I will simply say is that as your customer I now demand the below:

1) A proper explanation as to why you system is so poorly designed that I cannot simply reset my password and access my account without all this madness, and still I cannot log in;
2) This response needs to happen in a timely manner as once again I have paid for a service that I have no way of using and finally;
3) A refund for the months of paying for this service and not being able to access the account.",0
"I bought my first hifi system from Richer Sounds over 40 years ago and have never purchased equipment from anywhere else. Excellent service as always. I also 100% agree with all that Julian Richer stands for. A thoroughly decent man. If I decide to upgrade yet again in the future, it'll be from here. This time it was online, but previously from Cardiff, Chester and originally Tower Bridge. Always a great experience.",1

"I've spent the past week trying to sort out an address issue as I'm trying to buy the pixel 7 pro which would be an upgrade on the vodafone network for me.

I keep getting told that my address is not matching the one on vodafone database, yet I've sent proof showing that is precisely the same.

I've spent hours over 9 phone calls with MPD (waiting time is over 30mins) and although the staff have been friendly, I am nowhere nearer to the order being fulfilled.

There is no way to speak to anyone further up. and after each chat, the guys at MPD sends an email to their higher-up team to find out what's going wrong, and then i just get an email saying ""your addresses don't match"" yet, they do. I am sure this is a simple issue to sort, but I'm not getting any assistance with this simple actual error.

I've spoken to Vodafone online and on phone calls, have even popped into vodafone shops and looked at my address, tried to tweak it and it's all correct. and yet, the MPD ""computer says no"", and there seems to be no way of escalating this issue, even though I have proof via my bills which I've emailed over.

It is infuriating, and a shame as this deal is cheaper with MPD, and it should come with a free ¬£300 pixel watch, but if this deal falls through (which is looking likely) I will sadly lose out.

I am sure there is something simple, but without the ability to speak to the higher up team, this is sadly turning into a waste of my time. If anyone can help, please please get in touch as time is running out!",0
You will be hard pressed to find a better deal than this. I am well pleased with my purchase and will repeat it in the future.,1

"Deceitful company, stated despatched, but wasn't until 5 days later, make all excuses under the sun and fail to send confirmation of transaction and order, plus they procrastinate like hell when you ask for refund. My advice, is avoid and use more reputable company, fortunately paid thru PayPal so pursuing claim. In one word USELESS",0

"Terrible service. A sim only, upgrade deal purchased from Carphone Warehouse and before a sim was even activated, never mind sent out, my partners phone was cancelled. Leaving her stranded with out any means of contacting people or being contacted.

Despite pointing out the flawed system to the customer care adviser, they were not interested in helping or fixing their flawed system. As soon as you agree to a new deal, they automatically cancel your current line, leaving you with no service on your phone.

Not even a courtesy offer of anything to help the situation.

All of this leading to a cancellation, yet the old sim is still left not working and blocked. Five days are needed to unblock the sim, with no attempt to prioritise customer care.

Will not be using mobiles.co.uk or Carphone Warehouse again.
BEWARE!",0

"Vodafone emailed me in October offering a broadband upgrade or contract renewal fixed for a further 24 months fixed at the existing price ¬£24 a month. So I accepted the renewal. Seven days later I received an email cancelling my order, no explanation!!
Didn't bother contacting anyone just accepted it.
Then in December exactly the same offer, so accepted it again. Guess what?..........seven days later the same email saying the order has been cancelled, no explanation!!
So this time I have cancelled my broadband contract and I am moving to another supplier.
Why offer deals which you don't honour?
Why don't you explain why this happened?
You have lost a new 24 month contract, which I am sure doesn't bother such a large organisation, but it should.",0

"Virgin are shocking! Absolutely regret switching from Sky. The call centre is based in Cape Town and they really don‚Äôt give a damn. They hang up, transfer you to departments that cant assist and generally fob you off. After 9-10 calls/attempts to resolve broadband coverage, billing issues and an O2 sim not being delivery, we still haven‚Äôt resolved two of the problems. Going to switch back to a company that has far superior customer service. The two engineers (to be far were good) but now we‚Äôre get charged for installation which was sold as free! Avoid virgin they‚Äôre certainly not the company they once were!

Virgin have setup the security details with O2 which means we don‚Äôt have them so can‚Äôt access the account. Catch 22!",0
"Paid for GHD hot brush and gift set. Money was taken out straight away. 8 days later no parcel, and the money was refunded. Tried contact GHD and no reply or help. Checked website and what I ordered had now sold out. I‚Äôm panicking as it was a Christmas gift and still hadn‚Äôt arrived! So I had no choice but to go buy the item from another place I tracked down which cost me more money. Another week passes, suddenly I realise my bank account has been deducted just before pay day and it‚Äôs GHD back in taking the money again and then suddenly an email saying it will be with me next day. Again it was, another 3 days went past and was delivered to wrong address also. I‚Äôm more annoyed at fact I got not help, no email to say it was definitely coming and to take the money out, refund then take it again weeks later when I had no idea it was coming out and I had already bought a new one!!",0

I rang them on the day I got my first email congratulating me on my new phone to tell them I hadn‚Äôt bought a new phone and to check that no one has been fraudulently using my bank card, only to be told in no uncertain terms by some nasty female that they wouldn‚Äôt have ‚Äúbecause the address wouldn‚Äôt match the name and that they must have the wrong email address‚Äù - end of conversation!! No sorry, we‚Äôll change/clear the email address then as it‚Äôs clearly wrong, just constant annoying emails from Carphone Warehouse. Absolutely shocking customer service.",0
"Excellent company. Easy to use website.
They send the packaging to your address, then you take item to post office and retain tracking number.
They keep you updated by email of the process taking place.
The price I was quoted was the amount I received in my bank account.
This company are professional, efficient and trustworthy. I will use them again and have no hesitation in recommending them to family and friends .",1
Big shout out to Henry at Lewisham branch. Excellent customer service.,1
I wouldn‚Äôt even give half a start let alone one. Kept asking BT to change my bill date to collaborate with my pay date and kept getting told no. Fair enough but these seem to think paying ¬£67.00 per month for Broadband is acceptable?? When it was only supposed to be ¬£30. I have just changed my package to a different company with exactly the same thing BT offers me for only ¬£21.00pm. I don‚Äôt know how companies are continuously allowed to rip people off and get away with it!!! I constantly tried to set a DD up always and kept getting denied to do so all because they want that extra money they charge you for not paying DD. Company is a rip off and a joke!!!!!,0
Quick and speedy delivery and kept informed of when delivery would be.,1
"Would give zero stars for the run around carphone warehouse is given me. Done an upgrade online nearly 3 weeks ago, DPD managed to loose my phone, managed to eventualy talk to someone who talked to DPD, they had 48 hours to pay carephone warehouse the value of the phone then ithey would send a new phone, never happend. Ive e-mailed been given links to follow spoke to 2 gurus, one cut me off the other fobed me off both said get back to us in an hour.... can i get hold of one,2 hours going in circles on their site, you cannot get any form of contact with this company, unless you WANT TO BUY A PHONE AND GIVE THEM MONEY, then no problem, want to ask a question, i am actualy wondering if they ate blocking me somehow. Cant even get to cancel the contract have been trying to do that too now my 14 days have passed.
Disgusted and frustrated by the poor service if i can get out of this contract ill never deal with you again",0
"Excellent service.

BT deserves to have its license revoked, fed up talking to useless robots. Huge profits and overpaid greedy management but cannot be bothered with customer service.I urge every customer to cancel direct debit and this bring this pathetic company to it knees. They will say contact us via facebook or twitter W-T-F, no more automated robots. You deserve zero.",0
"Buyer beware, I ordered a dongle so my son could do homework when staying at his nans, the device was not delivered.
Can‚Äôt fault customer services both times I called were very helpful and have now closed my account with them.
The reason for this is due to the fact they tried to take ¬£62.44 out of my bank today for a device that cost ¬£13 per month. Check your direct debits if you intend on ordering from this company. Luckily I spotted it before it left my account and was able to cancel it.",0

"The whole Argos experience is negative. There is no way to filter out of stock items. Also, immediately I placed my order I realised that the system had reverted to the default size which would not fit me. I instantly tried to cancel the order i.e. Within one minute. Because it was a piece of Tu clothing the system does not allow cancellation. You have to wait until the item is delivered to the store, deliberately neglect to pick it up, then wait for 10 days plus to get a refund to your card. Absolutely insane. I will eventually spend the money on my Argos gift card, but after that I will never use Argos again. The whole system is incredibly badly thought out.",0

"So after multiple calls & watts app messages the cheque for a refund arrives or rather about 10% of the refund from when I was incorrectly billed. I now need to wait another 30 working days for the rest to hopefully arrive. Why this cannot be paid more swiftly via a bank transfer I have yet to receive an answer for despite asking multiple times? Waiting months & having to have multiple conversations to get this error sorted is really very poor customer service. Most companies can sort a refund in a few days or on the day, not a few months, why virgin cannot do the same I am not sure and would be interested to know why?",0
Fantastic service. Received the money two days after postage. Would highly recommend.,1

I expected my refund today and I have no refund. I will contact my bank to get through for this and I don't recommend them at all. It takes additional services such as court and the banks to get then to fix up.",0
"Same experience as many here, have been charged for unwanted passes after signing up for broadband. These charges exceed the cost of the service I actually want but so far have proved impossible to cancel. I have been told that they must be linked to an old account (they're not) and without access to this imaginary account, nothing can be done. They are quite insistent with this fictional account thing, despite me having the same, single email address for over 10 years and the fact that they have taken charges from a debit card that's just 3 months old. Only advice I was given was to cancel my payments and chase a refund through my bank. It is just unacceptable when you consider the amount of alternative providers to whom people could give their hard earned cash that Now TV continue to treat their customers this way. Currently 1 and a half hours into an unfruitful attempt to cancel my broadband to prevent any unwanted payments being taken again. Cut off by staff at every crucial juncture and have to start the whole process again. My advice, don't take the risk on Now TV but if you do, regularly check your bank account to see if their greasy hands have been picking your virtual pockets.",0

"I left Vodafone for Virgin just over a year ago after being with them for a decade. The prices were just too high, especially for existing customers compared to the deals newbies were offered.

Since then my vodafone telecoms account is till showing up on my credit report as an active account, I have contacted them twice about it. The first time I was told that I was actually due a small refund, however they had never sent me a bill or contacted me to let me know, funny how the are not quick to point out when they owe you money.

Once that was dealt with I was assured it would come off of my credit file within a couple of months, fast forward 10 months and its still there. Their customer service has always been pretty terrible in my experience but not updating peoples credit files is shocking.",0

- really bad documentation. spend so much money sending engineers that say its not their problem and then they send open reach folks who say its a wifi issue and then when you try to cancel the account they say (despite 7+ engineer visits) that the internet works fine and you're not allowed to cancel. Also customer service on the phone is a whole bunch of catch 22s so nothing gets fixed or sorted",0

Appalling treatment by Carphone Warehouse. Received a text informing me my repair was complete and to give 48hrs before collecting from store. Went to pick it up yesterday to find they had not repaired it at all! Reported moisture damage which is nonsense! The phone simply died when I was using it in dry conditions. I only took the phone out in November. A 2 year contract but the phone only lasts a quarter of that time. Not fit for purpose. Why send a text saying the repair is complete? How misleading was that?!,0

"Have been a customer for four years. Thankfully no issues. Until two days ago, when the internet stopped working. Have sat on hold with no answer, spoke to 4 people over the chat function which after 45 minutes each they seem to stop being able to see my replies and state that I have stopped replying. I have tried every troubleshooting thing they have asked. The last person told me to ‚Äòhold on there‚Äôs a process‚Äô. Yes I‚Äôm well aware of the chat process by this point. Then it went past nine and they closed the chat.. I assume to go home? Talk talk will be loosing a customer. I will not be negotiating the leaving fee. I was always so happy that it was straight forward and reliable but that seems to be luck of the draw. I will be further raising a complaint and looking elsewhere",0
Never use car phone warehouse it seems to be one big scam. That is my experience after two phones with them.,0
"Ordered Tuesday 7th and paid for next day delivery. Package didnt arrive on the 8th so I checked the parcel status and was told that the delivery driver had problems with his satnav so could not find my house. Customer support asked if I could provide landmarks etc (My house is in a housing estate and no delivery driver has had an issue before), I told them to use Googlemaps, you'd think that being able to follow directions (even from a A-Z map would be a requirement of a delivery driver).

Next day (Thursday) I now see the tracking status of the driver (I dont think they sent it out Wednesday and used the satnav as an excuse). I was 81st in the queue however the driver must have had an accident or something because the site stopped updating at delivery 41, his van was in a field and didnt move all day (I hope he is ok!).

Friday - nothing.

Its now Monday 13th, nearly a full week after ordering using next day and it has still yet to arrive.

Go else where like Overclockers, the delivery company Ebuyer use (Yodel) dont have the staff with the ability to deliver a parcel.",0

Yodel website now says that parcel is at their depot awaiting driver. Monday comes round and the Yodel website still says at depot waiting for driver. I called Ebuyer 3 times from 12 noon onwards for some more info and was told that Yodel would be contacted and then someone would get back to me. This never happened. On my 3rd time of calling I was told that you had to give Yodel 24 hours to respond and that the problem had only been raised today. I was left very embarrassed as I couldn't give my customer any details at all about something he required very urgently. All I could say is that it might turn up at some point, very unhelpful. I know couriers are busy this time of year and I know on occasion things go wrong, but to literally have no feedback at all regarding the delivery is absolutely hopeless. It is now Tuesday and we cross our fingers that some news may be forthcoming.",0

"No internet since 25th ( Monday)of July, first they said they gonna fix the problem by the 28th ( Thursday), got to that date nothing was done I call BT again, the said was because engineers went on strike they would fix by the weekend, so the weekend pass by nothing, call BT again, aparently they lift a fault for weak signal, I never said that what did I reported was no connection at all with a purple light on the hub, that being said, aparently no one did nothing about cause the report was a week signal, and I said "" if it was a week signal you should be doing something about anyway, you promised speeds at 48mbs minimum and I never got even that from the beginning"". So call them again cancel my contract earlier, that should end by 24 of September anyway changing for Virgin Media, so BT charge me 49¬£ for only broadband at speeds of 68mbs ( so they say) Virgin Media offers me 500mbs TV channels at 36¬£ so is a no-brainer. After BT realise that I was with no internet since the 25th (this was 2weeks without internet and a lot to f phone calls) they send me the ""amazing"" mini hub, well that's fine to check your emails and that it, that's not near good enough for me I like to stream, I love play games and I buy them all digital of course that mini hub is to slow for downloading any big file. So BT book a appointment for engineer at the 13th of August that one was cancelled, so after another phone call they arranged for the 16th so when that engineer came we couldn't do anything cause the fault is outside need to be openreach, So basically BT assuming that the fault would be in the house a cable or the internet filter, without after 20 days never bordering to check it, call BT again, is this lady saying stuff like "" I can see you have a mini hub"" or "" they said they gonna fix it in the next 48 hours"" So basically the mini hub is not good enough for what I do,and about the 48 hours I don't mind to wait 2 days but the problem is another 2 dayson the top of another 20 days. I have been with BT for 6 years never again, never missed one payment or anything they already emailed my bill of course BT is always in time for that, now waiting for 20+ days to have my service back, now my question is what would happen if I was 20 days late on my bill BT? Yeah we all know. Ps: Just to let anyone know, the BT help support ask you to go to Facebook or Twitter for help, do not brother doing that I send a pm text like 7 hours ago and no answer or even bother to open my message, this is just to keep you quiet, what a joke of company.",0
I feel like I was scammed by them. I can not return the phone in-store due to Covid? Webchat is not working and their call center line is crackling and you can not understand a single word. I tried to ring them 5 times and there is no way you can understand what they are saying. Vodafone says I have to speak with them to return the phone. I am going to send them a paper letter as this is literally the only option right now. I have 14 days to return it and no help at all from their side. This is a case that should end up on the consumer rights solicitor desk.,0

Vodafone is the worst company to exist. Their internet drops out every 15 minutes. I have gone and jumped through their many hoops and they still REFUSE to fix it. Honestly a waste of my money and time. Useless company that don't bother to do anything. All these reviews you see are true reflection of how crap they are. And guess what - they have done nothing about them. Don't ever use vodafone. Its a waste of your money. I will be moving elsewhere.,0
Straightforward & answered phone & was helpful BUT they should let you know that they are out of stock with a particular network BEFORE they take payment. I had to cancel & start again.,1

Have emailed & called and gone around in circles on the internet and web page.Staff i have spoken to are working from home and systems cannot cope and are crashing so they try put you through then nothing.
Also have been told by one telephonist that repairs are still going ahead so 8 weeks!!!! They have my number and all contact details but nothing. This TV will be out of warranty at this rate and we should of been refunded 3 months ago
Part 2) great standard response but still nobody knows where the tv is? Ace",0
"I wish I could attach the email chain for people to see how bad this company are at communicating. They don‚Äôt answer questions, take about a week to respond and the responses have no consideration of what you have sent them. I placed 2 order's. One I cannot fault but the other has just been a nightmare over the past month and a half trying to resolve the issue. I was sent either a customer return or a display item with damaged packaging and filthy contents within it. In the end I have had to go to my bank and claim under section 75 for my money back. Disgusting from a company like GHD you expect better.",0

Looking at your order, I can see that you are outside of the 30 day faulty exchange period to have the item exchange as well as outside of the 14 day returns period to have the item returned.

I can only recommend that you visit your local Carphone Warehouse store and find out if any assistance can be offered

Now I‚Äôm fairly sure that is not what the CONSUMER RIGHTS ACT 2015 states.

Dreadful service.

You can see from the reply below the impression that they might care but unfortunately I have already replied twice to them and still no reply so I‚Äôm afraid it looks like the customer service is smoke and mirrors or still just non-existent.",0

I got double from Mazuma than I got quoted anywhere else for my phone. The envelope to send it to them arrived fast and the day they received it I got paid for it that night - and I got paid the amount they quoted for it. I'm impressed and happy.,1
"You book a slot for collection and when you book, they say it will not take more than 5 days or they'll keep you informed. As 5 days was not an option for me, i gave them 7 days. I didnt book anything for the following Saturday so i could be around to wait for the return. I didnt get any update or text message tge previous day as i thought they must have forgot. So i gave them till midday on the day of the item to be return before calling them. Only to realise they only ordered the parts on the Friday and will take 3-5 days for the parts to be delivered then it needs to be installed and then tested before it can be delivered back to me.. i was furious as that will mean i will be without the TV for 3 weeks minimum.. as i can only be at home on weekends as people do need to work and their 6 hour delivery window is absolutely stupid. Even if they contacted me or given me a text on Thursday, i could have planned to do something on the Saturday which has now wasted my entire day.

So just to warn others that what they promise is utterly rubbish, dont keep you updated and overall disappointed..",0
"Exemplary customer experience

I arrived for my listening session to find the room set up and ready to go with the systems I wanted to audition. Darren was extremely knowledgeable and helpful, made me feel completely at ease about repeated comparisons, and ultimately made a tricky decision much easier.

Finally, the installed speakers look and sound incredible, which rounds off a wholly excellent purchasing experience",1

So the driver left and Delivero didn‚Äôt refound me trying to find excuses.

I have ordered food at 20.20 and now after all of this is 23.15.

Placed my order on 20th November 2020 and after a month of receiving nothing asked for my order to be cancelled and refunded. Its now 28 Jan 2021 and after several emails back and forth I still don't have any refund.
Stay well away from using this company.",0

"One TV show simply doesnt play, all others do. I've reinstalled the app, updated apple tv, updated the apple tv, followed all of the support team's intstructions and still nothing. Also, the app layout is awful, why is the search function all the way at the bottom of the app?!? Super laggy, way too many adverts for a paid service. Just awful.",0
Excellent company quick and easy service will definitely use again and recommend highly.,1
Purchased a phone in Carphone Warehouse on Henry Street yesterday which was Monday 15/7/2019. Was looked after by a woman called Ailish(hopefully I've got her name spelled right) extremely helpful member of staff very professional welcoming mannerly etc. Would highly recommend anybody looking for help choosing a phone or even a bill pay plan to definitely drop into the Henry Street branch beside arnotts and the Skechers shop facing Debenhams at the ilac and ask for Ailish. As far as I am aware these staff members get comission and this particular staf member worth every penny,1
"I have ordered two phones from this company to date. I had no issues with the delivery of the first phone which I ordered on Black Friday in 2018. In fact when the phone malfunctioned I was able to return it within the warranty and it was repaired and returned promptly. Having had success I ordered a second phone on Black Friday 2020 and what a mistake that has turned out to be. We are now three months down the line and I still have no phone. Far from the 7-10 working day dispatch time! The confirmation of order email stated that there were limited staff numbers due to COVID and government guidelines but a three month delay seems incredibly excessive. What I find even more frustrating and unbelievable is that the company has not once contacted me to update me on my order without me having to email them first to ask for an update. They have offered a refund but I am now unable to afford a replacement as the Black Friday deals have come and gone. It seems very much as if the company are attempting to sell phones before they actually get stock in. I have been willing to accept an alternative phone of the same or better specification but the company are not willing to offer a different device, despite having several for sale on their website and having held my money all this time. Despite the success of my first order I definitely do not recommend buying a phone from this company. Unless something changes drastically my family and I will be steering well clear in all future purchases.",0
Do not buy from this company. Lottery if you receive goods and if you do not good luck getting refund,0

"Shocking experience with Virgin and will never use again. I signed up for business broadband and was given an activation date of 6 weeks after my sign up. I was in no rush so didn't care about the wait, external works were due to take place before activation and I was supposed to get a date as to when an engineer would be out. I did not recieve any communication about an engineer and the initial date I was given passed. I was then in contact with customer services who gave me a date this time for the engineer but said my activation would be delayed a full month. Obviously I was not happy about this but I arranged to be at home and take the day off work to be here when the engineer arrived. The engineer did not show up so I phoned to basically cancel everything as this is now 7 weeks into the process. 1 week later and I still had not heard from anyone to confirm my order was cancelled. An engineer phoned my mobile this morning stating he was outside my house to do work. I told him I had cancelled and would not be using Virgin. Had to phone again this morning to ask why my order was still not confirmed as being cancelled.

Worst customer service I have recieved in quite some time and that's saying something. The disappointing thing is virgin had sent two guys out to cut a chunk out of the pavement in front of my property to install something which is an eyesore that is not even required for the company I have since chosen to proceed with.

Branson would need to wipe his Cheshire cat smile of his face and concentrate a little less on his ""woke"" airline ads and get someone to sort the imbeciles he has working for his broadband services. Shocking, do not use Virgin.

*in response to generic reply Dan below*

I have already been in contact with your company via chat and your pathetic automated call centre on multiple occasions to no avail. What sort of communication methods are those you have given, twitter? Who am I asking for on that you Dan? Bit of a broad platform to use to sort customer complaints. I emailed your customer service complaints team weeks ago and received an automated reply to say someone would be in contact within 48 hours, still no reply. Also requested everything be canceled and was told I would recieve an automated reply when it had been done, still no reply... Virgin are the worst avoid.",0
"I decided to change from Virgin Media as I was informed I could get City Fibre broadband in my area - 900mb/s for ¬£36 a month. I was previously ¬£96 a month for half the speed with Virgin, so this was an absolute winner. I now wish I never bothered.

I had nothing but problems from day 1. From my broadband not going live when it should have, to contacting customer services and being passed from pillar to post (mostly to the wrong departments) spending hours on the phone in the process, to being hung up on or blatantly lied to.

I spent 4 hours the day my broadband was due to go live, speaking to numerous different departments as no one could find my account - I hadn't been given an account number, and searches with my address and name apparently yielded no results. I eventually found out from Order Management that my order hadn't been completed and was told this would be sorted and my broadband would go live within 20 minutes. 24 hours later, still nothing. When my broadband eventually did go live (about 48 hours later), I couldn't get the Amazon Eero Pro WiFi hub they provided to connect to most of my smart home devices after hours and hours of trying. As far as google searches are concerned, this seems to be a known problem.

So I decided to cancel the whole thing as it wasn't worth the hassle. Again, no one could find my account as I STILL had no account number (despite having live broadband???). On one occasion I was passed through to a non-customer facing department. On another was told I'd be transferred to Order Management, and ended up at Technical after waiting almost 45 minutes. Numerous other occasions I was hung up on. I must've tried about 7 or 8 times to cancel before someone finally managed to get my details via the Order Management department, and advised they had placed a cancellation on my account. The following day, I then received an E-mail with an account number, and to advise my account had been fully set up and activated. This prompted me to call customer services back just to double check the cancellation had actually been placed on my account and, low and behold, it hadn't.

I have FINALLY managed to cancel, and have been told this will take 30 days to go through, but I'm still sceptical this will actually happen. Honestly this is hands down the worst customer service I've ever received from a company in my life. Maybe I've just been unlucky, but I absolutely would NOT recommend TalkTalk to anyone.",0

They received my phone and although i had to wait the next day for the payment, i did receive the full quoted amount. I would've liked a higher valuation for the phone as it is worth more but i just wanted it sold. Great Service. Only cons are didn't receive payment on same day but it was only a day late. Also the valuation isn't as high as i liked. However overall very good experience. Thanks.",1

What could be simpler than ordering, delivery, set up & old appliance recycling!
Ordered a fridge freezer in store for delivery with old appliance pick up (all paid for)
Day 1 - Sat 21st. Phonecall on Saturday despite me informing them the road was narrow they couldn't deliver as the 7 ton lorry couldn't access road. Re-arranged delivery for Sunday on smaller lorry
Day 2 - Sun 22nd - delivery time slot came and went, rang help line delivery was suspended as still on 7 ton lorry re-arranged delivery on Mon 23rd. An hour later knowhow lorry outside house (the same one that couldn't fit down road). They didn't have address details dumped fridge-freezer in dining room without unpacking or taking old one. Rang helpline. Re-arranged pick up for of old one and installing new one Mon 23rd
Day 3 - Mon 23rd - no sign of pick up, rang helpline. all drivers now finished re arranged for Tues 24th
Day 4 - Tues 24th - had someone wait in from 12.30 till 6pm no sign. rang call centre apparently the pick up was complete. (fridge-freezer still sitting in my dining room!) apparently the drivers had picked up a random washing machine!!! thought that was it. I am losing my mind at this point - re -arranged for Weds 25th
Day 5 Weds 25th Sept - lorry to big for road delivery suspended will re-log when driver returns to depot. (I had to ring them again)
Day 6 - Thurs 26th Sept - I had to ring helpline. They have no details of rebooking next available date for pickup and installation. SUNDAY 29TH Sept!

"Infuriated by the incompetence of this company, and at this point it feels like they‚Äôve just taken my money and done a runner.

The TV I ordered was faulty so I sent it in for repair. It was returned to me and upon opening it I noticed that the screen had been smashed in transit by the delivery team. This was back at the start of April and since then I have tried calling over 15 times, sometimes even being on hold for 2 hours. Even when I do make it through I don‚Äôt get any answers or I get cut off and no one even bothers to call back. My number is on file, I‚Äôve given it enough times.

I have been promised a voucher too so that I can get a replacement TV but this never materialises, no matter how many times I call up. No one can give me a straight answer. I have sent multiple enquiries and complaints by email and have heard nothing. I understand timings may be longer in the current climate but over a month to replace a TV that your delivery driver broke is unacceptable.

Would encourage anyone thinking of buying from this company to stay away, they are thieves",0

Number provided after troubleshooting wasn‚Äôt even in service. Staff yawning on the phone when I am talking to them and asked my to give about a millions different pieces of information to confirm my identify after I‚Äôd already given them sufficient information.

"ordered a monitor and air duster. DPD failed to deliver my monitor, was told by Ebuyer it was up the road at a collect point (despite home delivery) i went up there and wasnt there. i wasted hours on the phone trying to solve this, in the end they offered a refund or to send another one. i asked for refund as they had wasted huge amounts of time. they then said id have to return the air duster (¬£2 and wouldnt have bought it solo). they couldnt right this off as a loss due to their poor service, no they want me to waste more of my time returning the air duster. Useless shop elsewhere (Monday)

Update (Thursday): after writing my review here i was asked to contact the resolutions departmant (clearly they care more about bad reviews than customer satisfaction). I was offered compensation and free postage but unfortunately because of Ebuyers organisation system the employee I was in contact with have to get approval or check with the senior manager before anything got done. This led to a delay in credit being approved and in the meantime, i have found a much better offer on laptopsdirect.co.uk for ¬£40 cheaper.

Overall disappointed with Ebuyer, unlikely to shop here again. My justified complaints were not taken seriously until i wrote a bad review. Their staff are slowed down by managers which means staff take hours to get approval. The problems started on Monday and Ebuyer where only able to half resolve my complaints by thursday. Avoid buying from here plenty of other decent sites out there that offer cheaper prices.",0

"Previously reviewed these in July - and can only say THEY STILL HAVEN'T RESOLVED ANYTHING - in fact, they've made it worse and the revolting little yob they've put in charge of the case ignores me for weeks on end and then gets evasive and abusive. They eventually admitted that they'd messed-up the account so they opened a new one - for THE WRONG PRODUCT. That resulted in me locked-out of settings for the router, on top of the account settings that I still can't access. They are now trying to rip me off over the gift card inducement I still haven't received,

I've tried and I've given the bullying little git every opportunity. Am now passing this on to the regulator.

Best advice - STAY AWAY FROM THIS AWFUL COMPANY AND ITS VILE STAFF

EDIT - I didn't ask you to ""intervene"", I left this review to warn people to stay away from your sick company - but the fact that you have an ""intervention"" process in place tells us that your complaint's system is a sham and is being used to bully and abuse customers, (I also said that I am ""now passing this on"" - I didn't say that I had done so at the time of writing. Another example of you using scripted responses and dialogue boxes instead of actually trying to help the customer. I gave you the account number - until you are officially told by the regulator that they are involved, you have no right to refuse to provide support.)",0

Just visited.. poor effort made I had to approach the staff member and when I did I didnt really get greeted. Told him my issue and what I had done to try and resolve my issue though what I have found online. He then took my phone still without actually speaking to me. He tried plugging my phone in ( I have water damage issue) he said well the red light has cone on so I told him that was the iris decter light not the charging one (should that me my place to say that). Another member of staff then came in more approachable and tried to help. Outcome is me travelling 20miles from where a live to another store or they could send my phone away. No mention of how long it would take no mention of a replacement phone. So am I meant to just go without a phone?? Poor effort made once my contract runs out I will not be returning. In the meantime I'll just stick with wireless charging!! Poor,0

"I went to Carphone Warehouse in Cheshire Oaks today with the intention of buying a pay as you go phone. I already have a sim card with o2. The unlocked sim free phone I wanted was ¬£139, I was going to purchase this package but then noticed that the same phone with a pay as you go with sim was ¬£109 so seeing as I already have an o2 sim card I said to the assistant that I would just do that, get it with an o2 sim and switch mine in after I'd bought it. The assistant would not let me do this and was insistent that if I was going to buy the phone I would have to pay the ¬£139 as I had told him I was not going to use the new sim card. At first I thought he was joking as it makes no difference to them what I do with the phone after I've bought it and it makes no difference to o2 either but he wouldn't budge. So basically if I had just not said what I was going to do with it he would have sold me the phone at the lower price. This is the most ridiculous sales technique I've ever come across in my life, I didn't buy the phone and left speechless, it genuinely felt like I was in a Monty Python sketch or something. Carphone Warehouse must rely on people being stupid to make money, anyway it did me a favour really as I found the same model for ¬£100 on the net but they missed out on a sale through pure stupidity and bloody mindedness, I like to try and support shops by going in in person but would definitely never use this place again.",0

"I ordered my desktop PC on the 21st November, well before the 4th of December deadline at getting my computer WELL before Christmas day.

Let me just mention PC spec go by working days only, mon-friday....keep that in mind...because they secretly don't.

So going back 21st November I made my PC order on finance with Hitachi Capital (UK) it says on the pc spec site it takes around 48 hours to see if my application for credit was successful...
It took a week, was told my application was successful on a SUNDAY.

My order status then went into processing for about 3 day's usual time is 1-6 working days(mon-fri) so was happy about that, the only time I may add.

My order status was in pre-production normal time 1 week as mentioned on their site table, I was told it would take 16 working days for pre-production to finish, it took 19 working days weekends not included in that.

It then went into built mode and then testing in the same day

I received a call from a PC spec employee on a Saturday.....a non working day. Was a problem with a part I picked, I changed it and asked when will my order be ready for delivery as I need to take the day off work unpaid, the employer said Wednesday I would have it.

So on monday my order went to waiting dispatch by this time its 21 working days.
On Tuesday I called PC spec up and asked for definite if I was getting it Wednesday, because  I would have to ask for that day off unpaid to be in for it. I was told YES Wednesday I would have it.....
Tuesday night at 7 it is sill waiting dispatch, I call them was told no it won't be with me Wednesday(tomorrow) will be with me Thursday NOW
I was not happy at all, not only missing out on a days pay.. but now I'm not gonna be in for item to arrive on Thursday. An employer on live chat called Jakob said he starts work at 11:30 he would contact me on Wednesday by email to let me know if it's going out, that was nice of him to do that....but he never did that.

So I called on Wednesday my pointless unpaid day off to make sure it's still coming Thursday, as I would have to arrange someone I trust to wait for it.
They have no idea it will be most likely sent on Thursday, I replied with 'but then it will get delivered on Christmas eve!'
I ain't going to ask someone to stay round mine on Christmas eve.

So now I'm at a complete loss, stressed and wish I went with overclockers or someone else.

Not only does this company not know its a$$ from their elbows by lying to me with false information, I'm having to work my life around and arrange things for something that ain't happening.
I got a soundbar from China and a monitor from America within the time its took PC specs to even get me out of pre-production and they are based at Wakefield less than 2 hours away from me...I could cry if it wasn't so ridiculous.
Phone them 5 mins wait time in queue...then 4....5.....2.....5......2.....4....
17 mins later ya still waiting
Even that has no idea what's going on.

All I get in response is 'this time of year we get a lot of order's' then get more couriers to help with them order's.

I feel sorry for the people who ordered after me, when they getting theirs Christmas day?
I just can't wait for all this stress to be over with to be honest. knowing my luck so far my PC will have a defect and I'm gonna have to send it back, save me from stress send it back and get a refund.",0

"Food didn't arrived but app said its been delivered, no call no message no one ring my doorbell, I suspect the driver gave my food to someone else by mistake in the building, I contact deliveroo about my missing order they said there's nothing they can do and not possible to give me a refund. Wow... When is trust pilot going to introduce negative star as an option?",0
Can‚Äôt get an engineer to fix unstable internet in the house. Been 3 weeks and BT are hopeless. They subcontract engineer service to QubeGB ltd. They have cancelled two appointments last minute on the same day. They have now offered me another in 5 days. The BT seniors directors should all be fired. Qube GB are making huge profits whilst delivering awful service. The BT board needs to be accountable. They have a supplier failing to deliver service yet this supplier is making huge profits. Check their accounts out !,0
"Sent in a Samsung S20+ as part of a trade in and was quoted ¬£224. After over a week of hearing nothing I‚Äôm given a follow up email that the phone has been deemed ‚Äúnot working‚Äù due to screen burn and was REDUCED TO ¬£85. I personally have looked after this phone like it was made of diamonds. Original protective plastic was still attached when I sent it in and have a plethora of photos confirming the condition of the device.

I am yet to receive my device back as of this review and I expect to have to go Karen-mode on them for a second time to have it returned.

Avoid like the plague, genuinely criminal practices taking place.


Update:
Ignore the response I have received to this reply. The support channels lied to me 3 times about receiving tracking numbers for the return postage. I will update this review once the device has returned and I can inspect it.",0

"I'd think very carefully about switching to Vodafone Broadband as a new customer.

I switched from Virgin because Voda was offering a very good price on their gigafast pro package.

The initial purchase process was really smooth - engineer booked and received the new kit a few days before the appointment.

Unfortunately, the engineers (CityFibre) didn't turn up. Rescheduled the appt to the following week. They turned up to this appointment - however, the 2 vans sat outside my house for 45 mins and then phoned me to say something had come up before driving off.

OK...

So rescheduled again for the following week... engineers turned up, but said there was an issue with the pole and that they couldn't complete the job as would need a cherry picker and trained hoist... person. V apologetic and guaranteed all the right team (cherry picker and hoist person inc.) would be with me in a few days, taking me to yesterday, Friday 6/10

The team didn't arrive in the morning slot so I spoke with Vodafone's 'EasySwitch' (lol) team who confirmed the job was penned in and that they would definitely be there by 6pm. Alas...

So, called today after that no-show to be told that CityFibre was closed and that the next appt is not available until Weds. That would be the 5th appointment with absolutely zero guarantees it would actually happen and I'd actually be connected.

Unfortunately, at this point, I had to ask the team to cancel my order and I have just reordered Virgin, albeit for more ¬£ and less Mpbs. I also switched from Voxi (part of Vodafone) to o2 as part of that package so Vodafone has now completely lost a long-time customer.

I can't really imagine those who run the customer experience team and who are in charge of new customer acquisitions at Vodafone would be particularly happy with this insane flaw in their process... Appreciate CityFibre is a third party, but surely before selling a package to a new customer there should be a level of confidence that the service can actually be provided.

We have a street WhatsApp (I know, very cool right) and of course I'll suggest anyone else thinking of using Voda through CityFibre just don't.

I've raised a complaint so let's see, would be nice to be compensated for the 3 weeks without internet, not to mention the stress of trying to work from home with patchy 4G (eating into both mine and my partners allowance) and of not being able to use any of our connected devices, and of waiting around on 4 occasions for nothing to happen.

Hope this is helpful to anyone considering the switch - I see they have pretty terrible reviews overall, I would absolutely take that as a sign.",0

"Tried to purchase a ¬£300 item, paid for the item but it took me back to the payment page following the money being taken from my account. No order was placed - but I have still paid.

Contacted 2 different members at Argos who said they can't do anything and I have to wait a week to get my money back. I now have no money AND no item despite a promise of getting the item today in time for christmas next week.

3 times this has happened with Argos.",0
"Ordered a freeview box online, 4 days later received an email saying there had been a ""glitch"" (whatever that means) on their website and they had cancelled my order and would refund me. Checked on their website and the item was still available to buy. On the no reply email they sent there was a number to call for help.

On calling I was given 5 options, then another 5 options, each time I was given a further 5 options, in all 25 options. Now the best bit on pressing the last option I was given their website address to track my item and then a thank you and I was cut off.

They have no contactable email address. Later in the week I visited the Grantham store and spoke to a staff member explaining the problem, they didn't know why (helpful) on checking stock the staff member said he had two in stock and had no idea why my order was cancelled.

I bought the same item at the same price at Argos ordered online in the evening and collected next morning.

Curry's wonder why their sales are down, probable the way you treat customers. By the way this isn't the first time this has happened to me. But it will be the last.",0

"Made an order for delivery through their app, estimated time was about an hour and half, which I didn't mind when I ordered.
Once the time arrived, I received a message from the driver on the app stating he was outside, he wasn't. I immediately replied, and asked if he needed direction, he replied yes. So I gave him directions, he then asks me to leave my door wide open and lights on (it was dark out) which I didn't want to have to do as it was very cold out, and didn't want to let the heat out... But obliged.
So waited 10 minutes, still no sign I then asked him to call me...Of which he then suddenly closed the chat and the app stated my food had been delivered.
I was left confused thinking he might be round the corner, but nope it didn't arrive.

It was now 7.25pm, my 2 kids who had school the next day hadn't eaten dinner yet and were tired.
I contacted deliveroo who didn't care about any of the inconvenience caused and what the driver did.
Told me I wouldn't be charge, but offered nothing in credit for the inconvenience.

I then emailed them back and fourth and got text book responses with not an actually reply. Eventually got offered ¬£2.50 which I'm not using.

I've now deleted the app and will never be using them again. If something goes wrong on their part that is causing significant inconvenience to a customer they should at least compensate with a reasonable amount! Would actually make me think they cared about my custom and would order again in the future.",0

"This is the worst service I have ever experienced. Our internet was meant to be switched on on the 17th December, BT made a mistake and put us in the wrong area and so the engineer was not able to do so, they said this would be a 5 minute job if we rang back BT, we did, we got another appointment 2 whole weeks later (which is ridiculous) with an engineer who was meant to come 1-6 and my partner took a day off work and he never bothered showing up!! Now BT are saying it will not be done until 3rd feb earliest when it was their mistake. Absolute joke and completely useless. Have not been able to live in my flat as I have to work from home and have no internet so have to stay an hour away at my parents so I can work. Utterly inexcusable - if you‚Äôre looking to use BT please do be aware your internet will most likely not be on until 2 months later.",0
"Absolutely appalling. Worst costumer service imaginable... Beyond a joke in every possible sense. Too many things have happened in the years we have been with them to even list here... everything from overcharging us, not updating our details properly on their system, losing service all together, switch from home to business broadband not happening for 6 months, saying they've sent out engineers when they haven't, closing cases without even looking into them and hanging up on us on the phone. There is virtually no way to communicate unless it's them calling to threaten you about a service you don't have. Perhaps the most ridiculous is them trying to reach us on the landline that doesn't work (which they were meant to fix) and accusing us of ignoring their calls. Would actually be funny if it wasn't offensive. Stay clear from them. Moved to talk talk and finally free from this clown company.",0

"Firstly, it‚Äôs important to say that I‚Äôve been a happy VM customer for two years. However, due to the most stressful customer experience I‚Äôve had for a long time, I would strongly advise EVERYONE to avoid VM. It‚Äôs all fine when things are working, but after spending over 3 hours on the phone to 7 different agents, my stress levels are off the chart.

Problems started yesterday, Friday, when my WiFi and all devices connected (wifi and wired) were intermittent at best. Spent over an hour on the phone with a technician who was resetting, rebooting, doing all that stuff remotely. No real change for the rest of Friday. I had hoped it may have just been a glitch and it would all be fine today. Sadly not. Over two hours with different technicians, customer retentions, being cut off the line twice, being offered an engineer visit on Friday, a week after the problems began, plus the fact I work from home and need the internet working, my stress, anxiety and anger levels are indescribable.

No help at all from any of the VM team. No taking into account that I cannot work for a week. They did offer an earlier engineer appointment on Tuesday but I would have to pay ¬£25 for that engineer and then claim it back, why? It‚Äôs hardly my fault that your service isn‚Äôt working. They also stated I could claim ¬£8 back for the days it‚Äôs not been working, that‚Äôs going to cover my loss of earnings isn‚Äôt it.

It‚Äôs clearly the router hub that‚Äôs the issue. They refused to send a replacement, ‚Äòan engineer needs to visit first and say we need a new hub.‚Äô Initially customer retentions agreed that I could disconnect immediately to move to another company, after a short disagreement when they tried to charge me over ¬£200 for leaving early! They then had to transfer me back to a technician for a ‚Äònotation‚Äô before disconnecting. Then I got transferred back to a different person in customer retentions who flatly refused and said I‚Äôd been misled by ‚ÄòTanya‚Äô and that I couldn‚Äôt leave without paying the exit fee.

Clearly I‚Äôm absolutely livid at VM, they don‚Äôt have a clue what they‚Äôre doing. One person says one thing and another says something else. No regard for the fact that I have no idea how I‚Äôm going to work this week. The one glimmer of light is that VM are likely to increase their prices imminently which will allow me to leave this god awful company before my end date of April 24 without having to pay a fee.

My advice, they are cheap for a reason, their service is terrible. Please avoid VM and pay a little bit more for better service and peace of mind that the issues will be solved if something goes wrong!!",0

"Upon ordering an American style fridge for our townhouse, we were asked by sales staff how many stairs were involved in the delivery, which we answered correctly of 13. We also paid for installation, and door removing service as well. Sale went through, and delivery was confirmed for the following Saturday. Upon delivery, the 2 delivery drivers took one look at the stairs and immediately refused to carry fridge upstairs and install, stating health and safety would not let them, and stated that this happens all the time!! The fridge was unpacked and left in our hallway, blocking our access to our living room and garden! After drivers left, we went straight back to the store to complain. Original sales staff member, knew nothing about the stairs issues upon deliveries within the company, and the manager was less than helpful, stating he could get another team of delivery men out to us, but they might say the same thing, as it was their decision to do so, or not????

It decided when I tried to unlock it to only recognise me pressing keys 7,8,9 and 0 and unfortunately my passcode has other numbers in it so I couldn't unlock my phone. I hadn't dropped it. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me that Apple only gives a one year warranty but Vodafone gives a warranty for the second year if you have a iPhone with them on contract. So I went to my local Vodafone store.

Here's where the problems started. Unlike Apple they don't repair on site. And unlike Apple since COVID hit they don't provide courtesy phones whilst a phone is sent away for repair. They claim it can take up to 10 days to repair a phone. So they expect you to wait this long with no phone. You would think Vodafone would realise that nowadays your whole life is on your phone. I can't do so many day to day activities without my smart phone. Oh and the person in the store tried to claim that the government has banned them from issuing courtesy phones because of COVID. But if that is the case then how can Apple provide courtesy phones?

"I ordered an iPhone 14 Pro, on an 02 24 month contract. The phone arrived in good time, however the sim did not work in the phone. I was advised to wait and I did so for 4 days. On investigating with 02 they advised the sim/contract had been set up incorrectly by this company or that they failed to include the right information. This meant the SIM card provided, and indeed any SIM card on that network would never work on the phone. This company confirmed what 02 had said, and that there had been a technical mistake/error on their end and advised me they would have to cancel the order/contract and I would need to return the phone to them. This has been inconvenient as I‚Äôve had to wipe the phone to factory settings, repackage it, pay for special delivery and return it to them, and now I have to wait for it to be cancelled and be refunded which based on the timeline provided could be a couple of weeks.

This has all left me without a phone for over a week, and having returned it today will likely be a few more weeks until I‚Äôm able to get a new one. On this basis I have to rate my experience as one star. No compensation or apology has been offered despite their admitted mistake and error for causing this problem.",0
"Virgin Media are so terrible when it comes to complaints! I raised a complaint in March and then I managed to speak with someone which helped and now I had another issue for 6 weeks and when I raised a complaint this time, there was no human to speak to, all done via email which was terrible, slow replies, they don't read the notes or complaint just give generic response.

My issue went on for 6 weeks, affected me in a massive way, long delays, intermittent connection and then loss of service for a little bit. I raised it with independent complaints for help and virgin responded via their legal team, seems like they got too many complaints and removed the human talk and now you get legal involved. Legal provided a strong case, I'm not a lawyer so I couldn't provide details on that level and so I lost. Got nothing for the 6 weeks of broadband issues, terrible! If you raise a complaint with virgin media, all I will say is good luck!",0

"From the outset it was a waste of money. Joined to watch a specific series. Signed up and they took 2 payments from me. Thought I was signing up to one payment plan - entertainment. End up getting charged for Boost too. No idea what that was but assumed it was something I missed. Anyway 2 plans paid for and streaming wouldn‚Äôt work. Ended up on a live chat with someone who just couldn‚Äôt sort the streaming problem. Saturday night wasted. Steaming miraculous started working 2 days later. Watched my series then cancelled my membership. BUT HERES THE CON! I didn‚Äôt have one membership no I had 3 (unbeknownst to me). Entertainment, cinema and boost. They continued to take payments out of my account and the only way to stop it was to call my bank and cancel my card. When I contacted NOW TV nonsense customer service I get told that instead of refunding me they will ‚Äúcredit my account‚Äù - right with my money! Eh no how about refunding me as I‚Äôm not using any of your services. I‚Äôm still receiving emails asking for payment for the 2 accounts I haven‚Äôt cancelled (or used). Terrible company. Avoid!",0
"A basic and clunky tv player compared to rivals. The TV guide bears little resemblance to what is actually shown and when there are schedule changes, eg when sporting events are delayed, the tv guide is not updated. They do not care if they spoil the result of a sports event for fans trying to catch up with a scheduled replay. Instead of watching a scheduled replay of the Japanese GP I have been watching 1.5 hours of reaction and analysis. It seems pretty stupid to schedule a replay at this time when they know there is a good chance of the race being delayed. Also, why not have reaction on one channel and the replay on one of there other many many channels? Or at least put a banner up to tell the viewer when the actual replay will happen. Other providers are way ahead of Sky Sports in this regard.",0

"Reviewed two products, neither review absurdly negative or over the top (decidedly not recommendations, either) and they remain unpublished on the WEX website.
This is problematic for a number of reasons - you are invited to do so, so why bother if they won‚Äôt feature? The reviews you DO see are plainly only the positive ones, because WEX is selling those items. This is laughably unbalanced, approaching dishonesty.
If you see an item on their site with only positive
reviews this obviously gives a false impression, if more critical reviews are suppressed.

"Useless customer service. I ordered a Samsung galaxy S22 ultra 512gb in black with unlimited calls, data and texts as part of a 24 month contract with ID mobile on the 12th of November. I was informed when I called yesterday to get an update that the order was cancelled because I had a refund for the same item being processed. Therefore, the credit check failed.

I was also informed that I can only re-order the item on Monday the 28th of November 2022 or 5 days after the refund has been processes. The first order which I placed on the 9th of November, arrived with a damaged box hence the reason why I returned it. The reason why I re-ordered the same item promptly is because the item is discounted as part of a black Friday deal. The item is now now out of stock so I am unable to re-order it. I am very disappointed that I wasn't notified that my order has been cancelled after I placed the order and I had to call up 2 weeks later to find out for myself. The item was available for pre-order so I do not understand why it simply was not put on back order. I also called them twice on 2 different weeks and I was promised a call back. I did not receive a call back from the sales team. Shocking service, who on earth deliveres a brand new phone without adequate packaging!",0

"We took out a phone contract for my son 2 years ago. After speaking to staff about our budget, we were advised which phone to have that would suit his needs. After a month, there was not enough memory on the phone and even with an additional SD card this didnt help. He ended up having his dad's old phone so he could play games on it while we still paid the contract.
Then when we went into the store we found the monthly contract ended 2 months earlier than we thought and was told that the additional money we paid was lost. We have other phones with other network providers - tesco and they automatically reduce your payments when the contract has ended.
Staff were not helpful with limited knowledge. I'll not go there again.",0

"I recently visited a store in a Currys in New Malden. I was looking to buy a Pixel 3a and had to wait for ages before I was served. The assistant was uninterested in anything apart from selling me insurance and was then unable to print off a receipt dur to 'technical issues'

I agreed to have the receipt emailed to me but it has not arrived. I have tried to phone both the Carphone warehouse and Currys at New Malden but both times after waiting for 5 minutes and them telling me my call was important they cut the call and told me to phone back.

This was unusual for me to visit a store rather than buy online. After having this type of service I will not shop there again and I recommend that unless you need it today and are willing for to put with bad service no one else does either.

"Today 30/12/2022

I was moving house late Sep - early Oct. Trying to call early Oct to cancel the contract but not possible to connect with anyone even the live chat or calling 0345 454 1111 (Can't contact with virgin since early Oct until today, even today calling 3 times but all disconnected).

Decided to call sale team and immediately connected on 30/12/2022.

The lady was transferring me to lots of different team (Sale Team then Detention Team then Collection Team Then Movers Team). Not sure all the team's name are correct but on the phone for over 1 hour.

The guy on the collection team told me that my account was ¬£115 and he reduced to ¬£50. If I pay ¬£50 to clear the balance then he will help me to close my account (He will do it, not transfer it to another team). I decided to pay to get less stresses. After I paid, he suddenly transferring me to different team which is Movers as I think then the line just disconnected. The guy on the collection team was lying to me just to get the money and leave me alone.

I tried to call back the customer service number and amazingly the line is open and straightaway I connected with Movers Team. The guy on Movers Team was helpful but cannot help me to close my account due to some system issues. He advise me to call back later when the account is back on.

I'm not sure that when I call back, they can sort it out or not but virgin customer services is truly lowest quality services ever.

Be aware when sign a contract with them as it will be really difficult to cancel. The website does not have any clear guide for you to cancel. The live chat never get connected, the customer service number almost disconnected all the time.",0

"Appalling service, I ordered a phone for my son who lives in Clacton, over a 100 miles from where I live, to be collected in store by him. After placing the order I received a text saying the card used to purchase had to be presented, this was not spelt out in the terms and conditions, despite their claim it is. I telephoned the store in Clacton and was met with not just an unhelpful manager but an extremely rude manager. When I said I wanted to cancel, he said to contact customer service. I phoned customer service, the message said open seven days a week, but when you get through their automated system to the final option, it said closed, only open Monday to Friday. I phoned on Monday, got through to South Africa to a pleasant enough lady but such a strong accent, difficult to understand, she said I have to contact the store to cancel as it has already been delivered there. I phoned the store back and was met with another assistant who seemed so disinterested in anything, he said the payment won't be taken until you collect it (which we obviously can't). Now I see it has been taken off my credit card, so phoned customer service back, she said it will be refunded to the card in 14 days. I have written to complain about the absolute rudeness of the store manager at Clacton, among the things he said were that I obviously don‚Äôt read the terms and conditions like most customers, he kept interrupting me, when asked not to interrupt he said No and kept misquoting me and when I told him I was going to complain he said ‚Äúyou obviously have too much time on your hands‚Äù My advice, don't go anywhere near Carphone Warehouse or Currys PC World, all tarnished with the same brush",0

"UPDATE:
I sent the laptop back for repairs. It was gone for two weeks and the problems are now even worse than before.

Rather than fixing the problem I had with my NVIDIA Graphics card, they have straight up uninstalled my Intel GPU. The laptop no longer has acces to it.

On top of this they have also locked my D: drive, which I now no longer have access to. I cannot believe how TERRIBLE this company is and I will tell everyone I know. By now I've heard from loads of people online they have had so much trouble with PC Specialist.

I also work in a technical field, and PC Specialist can be assured I have told everyone and I will keep telling everyone. I've also heard from multiple colleagues they've had similar experience. WORST WORST WORST experience ever, AVOID AT ALL COST!

There has only been one person at the company who has at least kept me informed and helped me sort things out. He has been friendly, but he can obviously only do what his manager approves as well.

ORIGINAL:
I was hesitant to buy a laptop from PC Specialist as I knew two of my friends have had trouble with their laptops in the past. Despite this, I ordered a new laptop for my job from PC Specialist. However, from the very first use, I got graphical crashes. Whenever I have Chrome open, attend Zoom meetings etc. The laptop screen freezes and only displays distorted images of what should be on screen. The laptop just does not seem to use the Nvidia graphics card, but only the internal Intel one.

I contacted PC Specialist within about two weeks to notify them of this issue. I monitored various things, but it is very disruptive for my work. After contacting them several times by email I decided to call in the hope someone would take me serious. At that point the laptop was still less than a month old. The customer service member at that point told me he would look into the possibility to replace the laptop altogether, because it was so broken within a month and I just can't use it.

It has been a month since then and I am still stuck with a broken laptop. Now they want me to send it back so they can inspect and potentially repair it, which means I will not have it for 3-4 weeks and I will miss my income for this time. This is also no guarantee that it will work upon return to me.

While all of this has been going on I've heard from more friends and colleagues that they have also had trouble with laptops from PC Specialist.

I strongly advise anyone who is looking for a reliable laptop to not buy from PC Specialist. I even paid extra for insurance and cover, none of which seems to make any difference now, what a scam. Laptop came in broken, customer service does not take the issue serious and overall a very expensive mistake.",0

NowTV had failed to fulfil the order but not clearly communicated that.

I have been with Vodafone for 2 years. They suggested increasing the fee each April and they did a 20% rise since my original contract.
But when it came to renewing the contract, I negotiated the fee with customer service. One of them cut off the line in the middle of the negotiation. And then, I called again with a long process to reach out in person. I mentioned their offer to new customers, which they offer ¬£25/m and ¬£100 voucher to give away! I asked them to give at least ¬£25/m, instead of the current ¬£27/m. But they offer ¬£33/m for the same service.

"failed delivery twice costing me time money and very poor sleep waiting for deliveries

Friday 28th June ‚Äì order the goods in store in person. Washing machine and fridge freezer. Choose Tuesday 2nd July 13.30-17.30 as delivery slot. On night shifts full time, i finish work 8am go morrisons on way home buy lots of fridge food ready for when it arrives. Not freezer food because I think delivery time is too long and it will defrost before the fridge freezer arrives. i pay for daughters' taxi to come over from town and sit and wait until 3pm (im asleep) when she has to go back to town to fetch her kids from school, I get up and take over, pay for daughters taxi back into town sit by window watching and waiting. Keep checking online which says delivery on route. Nothing arrives. Daughter calls in for me as my mobile has internet signal only at the house (no phone signal) and my landline is meant to be for incoming calls only. Informed my daughter that they went to house but nobody answered so they‚Äôve gone, they took a photograph (house with white door and steps, wrong address as mine is brown door no steps and nobody came I was sat at window watching and waiting) informed they wont be out until Saturday next. I call in myself begrudgingly using landline which I didn‚Äôt want to do but so angry I have to wait until Saturday when its their cock up, also they are still out delivering at this time. I'm on night shifts Friday, Saturday Sunday.
I speak to a man- very very apologetic about everything (spending money arranging taxi, fridge food I now have to either throw or give away) he gives me a reference number for the complaint tells me he can put me in for early delivery Saturday (although I don‚Äôt understand why I have to wait that long for mistake to be rectified) as I will be asleep all day, he says I can have 07.00-11.00 slot. I tell him I don‚Äôt leave work until 8am. He puts down for 8.15-11.00 delivery. I give my landline number and tell him to pass on that I get no mobile signal at the house. He gives me reference number for the complaint. He asks me if my house is easy to find as he is unsure why they went to wrong address, I tell him that I only moved in the previous week, when I came to look at it my satnav took me straight to it, sofa I had delivered the day before from Birmingham came straight to the house no problems, Since this conversation my partner from Yorkshire came down, sat nav brought him straight to the door. I don‚Äôt understand why the delivery driver couldn‚Äôt find it. I email customer services to confirm the conversation, confirm that as stated I will be home by 08.15 and to confirm my landline number. I receive an acknowledgement email thanking me.
Friday evening ‚Äì confirmation text about delivery on Saturday, says 15.40-19.40 slot. Customer services closed so I have to wait until I leave work 8am Saturday morning to speak to anyone, lady denies all knowledge of delivery time I was given. I tell her I wont hear anyone come that late that they are now saying I will be asleep upstairs, mobile phone has no signal, house phone downstairs I wont hear, I tell her that I was given that slot specifically because of my working nights and it was a rearranged delivery as it was because they went to wrong address last time. No movement on her part for different delivery slot time. I tell her I will have to sleep downstairs on sofa in that case, I need my washing machine I have no uniform left that is clean to wear for work. I tell her to make sure they ring the doorbell to wake me up. I have an awful sleep on sofa, hardly slept, not comfortable, keep waking up, finally get up 17.30. Delivery not arrived, I go onto live tracker, says im number 23, they are on 18, near Broadway about 5 miles from me. I keep checking tracker, says they are on number 23 which is me. Then it all disappears around 18.30 a message comes up on the tracker site saying they need to speak to me about my delivery, I call the number on the message, closed for the day. I start to panic, I go to bathroom upstairs, voicemail comes through on my mobile ( no phone call on my landline which I said specifically to call) says they will not be delivering as they are running out of time. This is over an hour and half before time slot runs out ! I cant get hold of anyone, stores closed, everything closed at 6pm. I am now extremely tired from having poor sleep on the sofa waiting for the items that yet again did not show up but yet again going to have to stay awake as its sunday and the store doesn't open until 10.00. I have ordered the items from Argos. I AM going to get a full refund today. DISGUSTING",0
"1 star is being way too generous we have been without the internet for 16 days
Every day it‚Äôs the same story- ‚Äòwe‚Äôve contacted BT Openreach they‚Äôre sending an engineer out- same result no change

Avoid this company line the plague",0
"I think the policy of a missed delivery needs to change.

I was stuck in traffic and all I ordered was some beer from a local shop. No attempt at trying to re-deliver.

I can understand a takeaway or something you can‚Äôt exactly return the food for refund etc but some beer from a shop? Come on. That‚Äôs easily returnable and easily refundable to your customers, Deliveroo.",0
"I have been without broadband since 13th July and what a fiasco it has been trying to get the problem resolved. It started when two incompetent so called engineers couldn't run a fibre cable to my property due to a blockage. After contacting BT to inform them of the situation and obtain an assurance, verbally and in writing, I wouldn't lose connection, low and behold around an hour after the cowboy engineers left, my service ceased. So here we are, 28th July and STILL no broadband despite numerous calls, failed engineer visits, lies, broken promises and diarised calls not being made. As I write, I'm patiently waiting for a call back from yesterday to resolve the complaint. This was on the back of an hour and a half call to BT only to be hung up on. Absolute joke of an organisation given that communication is their thing but, it's one thing they fail to do.",0

Never again!",0

I signed up for 10 month football sports pass with Now Tv to watch my team Man City. Last season I had same pass and was able to watch lots of Man City games.

"Worst experience of my life; would have given no stars if I could. Signed up for fibre optic in April and cancelled within the cooling off period as had a better offer from Virgin media. They never cancelled, account was still live, they sent BT to set up fibre optic even though I cancelled, sending me emails and a bill this week for nearly ¬£70 for a service I never used. Spoke to numerous people, some of which didn't know what was going on and some who told me to ignore emails and texts that were sent. I am not paying the bill and cancelled my direct debit. Even emailed a complaint and received an automated reply saying I should call the chat line; so not even a proper complaints process is in place. Will be contacting the Ombudsman if they don't quash this bill and continue to harrass me. I would not recommend talktalk to anyone and I would avoid them like the plague.",0

"This is by far the worst experience I have had in purchasing any product. I‚Äôd waited months to be able to upgrade my new phone and an experience which should be exciting was instead awful.

I understand it wasn‚Äôt nearing the end of the day on Sunday but I went in and told the sales exec the phone I wanted, not only did he pressure me into taking a phone which was different (I presume they get paid more on this phone) but was also more expensive.

I was unsure of moving away from my current provider yet he assured me I had my 14 day cooling off period to think about it, swiftly handed me a tablet to sign on without any sign of the terms and conditions - foolishly I trusted him. Having spoken with my current provider the week after I decided to stay with them and went back into carphone warehouse store within the next 2 days to be rudely told, I was not entitled to a 14 day cooling off period due to purchasing in store!!!

There was no sympathy from the store manager or no apology as to why I was lied to and uninformed of this - having known this beforehand I would never have signed into a contract. I was advised to ring the customers services number, which I did twice, to again be rudely told - there is nothing they can do and I needed to go back into store again.

I contacted carphone warehouse two weeks ago regarding this and I am still awaiting a response!

Absolute disgrace.",0

Same issue with chat but finally again a reorder of the tile to be sent. 3rd time again sent with the exact same issue despite pictures. This time told on chat we need to place the reorder and although they would credit us the price of the tile would have to pay shipping and packaging again! Are you kidding you‚Äôve sent me my order wrong 3 times and I should be out of pocket,0
Have had nowtv for years but they have lost me as a customer. You used to be able to watch on 2 screens but this year they changed their name to NOW and dropped the price of a cinema pass by ¬£2 but it actually costs you ¬£3 more because you now have to pay ¬£5 for a boost pass if you want to watch on more than 1 screen. They then put the price up for the entertainment pass because they bunged the entertainment and the kids pass together( 2 totally different types of entertainment üôÑ) l think Netflix will do well out of this NOW cock up because that's where me and other people i know are heading.,0
Sent off my iPhone and was offered ¬£245 but got an email within 30 minutes of them receiving it to say it had scratches on screen and chips in the paint which I believe not to be the case. Wish I had read these reviews before I accepted their ¬£200 offer. AVOID .,0

"I've been using TalkTalk for more than 3 years. I wanted to upgrade to a faster plan as a new fibre connection was installed to my neighborhood. The upgrade process was swift, nothing was swift after that.

Openreach engineer came about 5 hours late to our appointment, and did not fully complete the work. He told me someone else will come in 48 hours. I called TalkTalk after 48 hours to check why no-one came. They informed me they couldn't do anything and I should just wait.

Couple days later, I got a text message from openreach telling me that they will give an update in one week. another week passed, no update, but another sms message delaying it for another 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, it happened again. I contacted TalkTalk to ask them why my order is still not installed after 2 months. They just said to wait again for the next update from openreach! I cannot stress enough how inexperienced their customer service team is.

I got fed up and decided to leave TalkTalk at this point. I got transferred to some other department, and they transferred me to some another department and they transferred me onto one other. Each person I spoke to was telling me I should be speaking to blah blah department instead.

I finally got a cancellation, with a end date of 26th December. I came back today from holiday to see my broadband is still up and working. I am currently on a call with another representative explaining to her AGAIN why I want to leave TalkTalk. I TOLD YOU 50 TIMES ALREADY. She is telling me my account is still active.

I dont have my pre ordered phone! I had no email, no letter, no phone call, no text, no nothing from them.

I had to call up myself to see what was going on and all I got was an outsourced call to someone who barely spoke English and didn't take me seriously. She couldn't seem to understand how not having my pre ordered phone was an issue and that I should simply cancel my phone and order a different one? What sort of customer service is that??

I'm honestly so shocked with my experience. I now have no phone seeing as I sold my previous contract expecting to have my new one already

Seeing as they won't take my complaint seriously or see what the problem is I'm going to the ombudsman to see what he thinks about it.

Thought a new phone for Christmas would be nice, now I have to deal with all this instead of enjoying time with my family.",0

Besides, on 03/08 I was already charged the monthly fee, soon afterwards I was also charged the upfront, and now on 04/08, I will be charged again FOR A MOBILE PHONE THAT ALREADY RETURNED.

Update: I got in touch with them as suggested, the operator couldn‚Äôt find any issues in my area and had some useless suggestions such as turn the wifi off on my phone or close the running background apps, before I could answer that I am not having wifi therefore I make sure the wifi is always turned off on my phone the chat disconnected and I received a message: Whoops, looks like we got disconnected - if you still need to chat, you can get connected via the Three app or Live Chat

"I'm at so dissapointed with the service I received. I ordered a PC from PC Specialist in time so as to have it for my son at Christmas. This was his present from santa. I was given a tracking number from FedEx who were supposed to deliver by the 17th December. Having rang both PC Specialist and fedex every day when it hadn't turned up. The lack of care totally surprised me. Its the 27th December now and still nothing. The tracking is saying its still at Stansted since the 12th December. Fedex told me it has made it to Dublin but was waiting for one more security clearance. To say I'm dissappinted is an understatement. My little boy is still so upset snd has ruined his Christmas. This costs me 902 euro and because I had spent this I couldn't afford to go out and buy something else at the last minute. I'm a single mum on a low wage. I still have no idea when this is likely to turn up. I expected at least a phone call from the company apologising but to date absolutely nothing. Very disappointed üòû

So today's update. Fedex had put it down for delivery up to 6pm yesterday and still nothing. Having called them today, the lack of care is unreal. They said it had yet to pass through customs, having told me yesterday it had been out for delivery. Which is it?? I've never dealt with such an unprofessional company in my whole life.

In fairness to PC Specialist the guy I spoke to today was new and tried to console me. He said there was nothing that could be done from that end as it was with FedEx. I agree with previous reviews in that if you are looking to order a PC then think again especially if you live in Ireland.

I still have a very upset little boy who has lost all belief in santa over this and that's the biggest upset of all.",0
Ordered a sofa on 3/11 still haven't received it. The said they could reorder it on the 6/12 without any fees as they can deduct it from the refund I am due as my order has been lost (how you can lose a sofa I don't know) They haven't issued the refund and said they will not complete order until payment is made which isn't what I initially was told. Requested a call back 2 weeks ago. I am a business woman so my phone is always close by they haven't called back once and the complaints team don't respond.

"Horrendous customer service.
Waited an hour to have a notification to say the driver was at my address and couldn't find me. Checked my street, nothing. Rang the driver, no answer. Messaged the driver, still nothing. So I checked the GPS tracking to find he was in an entirely different location nowhere near my home address, which I've checked multiple times and is correct on the order.
I then get a notification saying he couldn't deliver but I'd still be charged the 50 quid for my food and service.
I contact customer services and a very rude lady tells me there's nothing they can do as they tried to deliver. I explain that if you check the gps he never tried to deliver as he came nowhere near my home. She just repeated the same line over and over and said there's ""nothing more than can do"". On requesting multiple times to speak to a manager she kept saying they share the same policy so she couldn't help.
So, for my partners birthday, I'm 50 pound down, late on a Sunday evening, with no food to show for it, and the most enraging customer service assistant who didn't bother to even look into the service but just kept repeating the same line. Even a second of investigation would've shown no delivery attempt was made, but she couldn't be bothered. Appalling. I'll definitely be sticking with Just Eat.",0

"Absolutely diabolical service received!! The service that I have received includes
1. Staff mis sell products for financial gain.
2. Staff starting services earlier than is in the customers best interest....forcing customers to pay their existing provider AND them for the line.
3. I spent a total of 2.5 hours in their branch, so the guy took out a contract for faster broadband (which, I did NOT need) and when he was advised of the same, HE HAD TO CANCEL THE POLICY AND START ALL OVER AGAIN!!
4. When, I then contacted Customer Services, to advise them of the terrible service received in branch, the staff member spoke bad broke English, whereby despite repeating my experience 3 times and them repeating their understanding of the situation 4 times (total of 7 times), I'm then transferred to a Manager, whereby I'm forced to go through security AGAIN......and then forced to go through my NIGHTMARE experience AGAIN/8 TIMES!! I spent over 60 minutes on this call.
4. I'm then told my service will be switched on at a later date to the 3rd January 23!!
5. However, following raising a complaint, I HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT THEY HAD CANCELLED MY SERVICE, DESPITE NOT ASKING THEM TO or THEM ADVISING ME EARLIER!!
6. HOWEVER, FOLLOWING THE CONVERSATION WITH THE COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT TODAY, THEY HAVE SAID THAT IM NOT ENTITLED TO ANY COMPLENSATION FOR ALL MY INCONVENIENCE, AS THEY ALREADY CLOSED MY CASE, YESTERDAY - when they were not able to contact me to discuss my complaint !!!
7. I asked the acclaimed Manageress today, did she not think it was important to ask me OR advise me that they had cancelled my contract, before cancelling my contract.
8. I was advised that the line had been cancelled BUT, they were happy to reset up another connections contract.....THEREFORE, THEY WERE HAPPY TO WASTED THE HOURS WASTED ON TAKING OUT AN ORIGINAL CONTRACT & WOULD REQUIRE ANOTHER CREDIT SEARCH - YET, WHAT SHE FAILED TO MENTION IS THAT TOO MANY CRREDIT SEARCHES WILL DAMAGE YOUR FINANCIAL HISTORY ON EXPERIAN OR EQUIFAX!!!",0

"Used to be good but customer service is now extremely poor. Dad ordered an Xbox game for my son for Christmas. Upon opening it on Christmas Day, we discovered that the disc inside the box was a completely different game.

I've been buying from Music Magpie since 2017 and they have usually been good. When the occasional slip up has occurred they have fixed it very quickly. However, things appear to have changed for the worse.

First, contacting Music Magpie used to be easy, but they have recently hidden their contact form. Now when you click the Help & Support button next to your order, they send you to a useless FAQ page.

Thankfully, I still had the link to the Contact page from a previous email, so my dad was able to contact them to ask for a replacement, adding that we were happy to send back the box and incorrect disc if required.

First they denied all knowledge of the order, having put no record of it on his profile. Then they delayed a response by asking for the order number, which he had included in the contact form but apparently they couldn't see this for some reason.

After he provided them with the order number via email, their response (a few days later) was this:

""As per our terms and conditions, all missing or faulty items should be reported within 30 days of the estimated delivery date and unfortunately, your request has been made outside of these delivery guidelines.

Due to the length of time that has passed, we do not have access to our records for this order anymore, as such we are unable to help you on this occasion.

We are sorry that we can't be of any further help.

Kind Regards,
Tyson
Customer Services""

Tyson clearly doesn't understand how Christmas presents work. Add to that the postal delays caused by Royal Mail strikes leading up to Christmas and it's clear to see that using their estimated delivery time as the starting point for the returns process is simply absurd. And that they ""do not have access to our records for this order anymore"" is no excuse. Not only have they failed to deliver what was paid for, they have failed to keep a record of it. Both of those things are nobody's fault but theirs, but they won't clear up their own mess. (Incidentally, Music Magpie has records of my orders going all the way back to 2017. How have they lost my dad's order from a month ago?)

The solution to this is simple enough - just send a replacement. They have plenty of this title in stock and this is exactly what they have done in the past. But this is now apparently too much for Music Magpie, who clearly no longer care about the quality of their service (placing the wrong discs in boxes) and choose to stonewall their customers when they (Music Magpie) are at fault.

So after six years and countless transactions, they have now lost me as a customer. I'll be using CEX from now on instead, where the customer experience is consistently much better.

--

THE NEXT DAY: FROM BAD TO WORSE.

Just hours after Ziggy's response, my dad received a refund... For ¬£1.50, the cheapest item of the four in his order, which was NOT the faulty item.

He made it absolutely clear in his original message which item was at fault. The faulty item was priced ¬£6.39 - more than four times the refund issued - and this is detailed in his order confirmation. But Music Magpie have apparently hoped that they could get away with refunding just ¬£1.50 for the cheapest item in his order and that we either wouldn't notice, or would give up complaining.

""Tyson"" sent my dad another barely comprehensible message stating that we ""can still order from us [Music Magpie] with confidence"". But after this debacle, that's patently nonsense. I've got even less confidence now than I had at this time yesterday, which was near to none at all.

While Music Magpie like to monitor Trustpilot and make out here that they're friendly and efficient, they also make it as exasperating as possible to fix problems without taking the time to come here and giving them a public dressing down. It should not be this hard.

Could Music Magpie have done a worse job of managing what should have been a very small issue with a very simple fix? It's hard to think that they could get it wrong from here, but we'll see.

Looking forward to Ziggy's response to this update.

OMG. THEY MADE IT WORSE.

More hoops to jump through! Yesterday they were happy to issue a refund. Today they want me to get my dad to email them to authorise them to deal with me. Like he'll get a reply.

Ziggy, here's how to do your job:

1. Find the order in YOUR records. My dad gave you the order number twice and I gave you it here to verify that this is a genuine purchase.
2. Find the game in the order that is at fault. This is the one that my dad specified in his original complaint to you. I know this because I worded that complaint.
3. Refund the value of that game to my dad.
4. Say sorry.

Is that too hard?",0
"Be careful with currys ive had terrible experience where the info on a sony tv bravia KD49XH9196BUwas wrong i wanted hdmi 2.1 and they said it had it. I tried to compare it with other tvs but currys have different product codes. It turns out i was comparing it with the same tv but i made a mistake thinking the reason it had a different product code was because it had hdmi 2.1, unfortunately that wasn't the case they made a mistake. I dont know why they have different product codes but i do know it stopped me getting price promise. When i realised the mistake the customer service online were good but they couldn't do anything and i had to phone. but thats where it got bad and very stressful. The first phonecall was with a person who sounded like they were at home during lockdown ""maybe at home"" with people laughing in background and being argumentative it was very stressful and was very surprised how bad they treated and talked to me, they didn't care. but i still tried again and the next time they told me they didn't make mistake basically called me a liar even though im obviously not the only one it happened to, theres other reviews that say the same.",0
"I don't care how cheap a deal Virgin may look... it just isn't worth all the hassle and endless explaining of the various problems you'll end up with if your installation is anything like mine.
I've had to explain to support over and over and over and over again to so many different support staff who promise to help but they cant help and inevitably end up cutting off the chat leaving me back at the end of the queue again and this happens quite frequently.

They even refused to send a deadlock letter so that I could take my issues to the ombudsman, telling me that's not what was needed!

They want almost ¬£300 to terminate the contract even though the phone never worked for weeks, and the internet service is still so unreliable that I'm now using the hotspot on my mobile phone for internet service as the virgin service breaks every half an hour.

it's been the biggest mistake of my life signing up with this company.",0
The same phone is on Vodafone for ¬£36 with 100 mb and unlimited call and text a lot cheaper and a lot more mb so I‚Äôm not happy,0

"Worst customer service experience ever.
We ordered 4 machines for a really important VR project. One of the machines arrived faulty due to very poor packaging. We let them know, and they refuse to refund or send another machine because according to them, we should have let them know within 72 hours. We just found out about the faults. It takes more than 72 hours to set up 4 machines. What kind of company does not help you at all, after you purchased 4 machines and spending thousands of pounds, for their own fault? I am speechless- DO NOT BUY FROM THEM.",0

"The only reason this is 1 is because I can't choose lower.
I have been a BT customer for over 50 years and because I have decided to choose another provider at a third of the price for a useless broadband with BT.

I would have checked my rights in my policy schedule to see how long I was expected to wait for a repair butg I am not able to access my protection plan ‚Äúonline‚Äù but it does give the option for my plan to be posted to me. I selected this option some time ago, but no plan has ever arrived. Yesterday (Wed 1 Feb) I called to enquire when my washing machine might be repaired. I was informed that I was now eligible for a replacement machine. I was told that an email would be sent to me to accept this solution. No email arrived. I will now have to call again today and enquire on the correct procedure. I was also assured that my policy plan would be emailed to me. No email arrived. I have had to be proactive throughout this period and still I am not being helped by Domestic and General.

I've been a loyal customer since 2008 and was mistaken in my belief that it would be rewarded. Hands up my own fault for not keeping on top of things but I found that when family came to visit bbc iplayer couldnt load. I had mainly been using the broadband home office Internet and not TV. Aside from the slow speed what was a bigger shock was ¬£67 a month price especially when a price comparison had deals from ¬£18. Called and was offered ¬£47 price plan and then a basic package for ¬£36. Finally after pointing out that new customers could receive a deal of ¬£28 I was offered the same but refused to add the ¬£70 voucher that was part of the deal. So in a nutshell slow speed at a premium price and fleeced for staying loyal.,0
I just received a horrendous experience at Argos Finchley road when I went to purchase an item. The manager Ricky was extremely rude and had shocking manners. If Sainsbury's doesn't want to train the staff to save money at least they must employ someone with a bit of common sense and manners. This was the second time I had this awful experience with Ricky. It's unbelievable.. It's ashame there are some good products at Argos but the customer service couldn't be worse. In fact I decided to return the item I bought because I don't want to be reminded of the appalling experience any time I use this item. Such a false economy. Never again !,0
"DON'T ORDER ANYTHING UNLESS YOU WANT TO WAIT 3 WEEKS FOR IT!!!!

"Absolutely terrible experience from the start. Mis-sold a SIM and Unbreakable broadband, despite saying I cant received EE where I live - sales person lied and said they have a booster which means I will get it! That is an absolute lie!

Received the SIM - no reception, called and told I couldnt cancel SIM until after everything was set up as it was part of an ""open order"", so delayed by a week. I went on to hear this excuse rew open order many many many times that day and the next.

Set up was for a new line as old line has faults on it which Talktalk failed to resolve - no new line, all attached to the faulty line. Spent 4 hours on the phone trying to get this resolved and an engineer booked in for the following day, only to be told ""computer says no"" as the order is still open. Out of sheer luck the engineer (a sub contractor, not BT Openreach) called me at about 5.50 and came to the house to check everything when I told him about the fault - he advised that he was contracted just to take over the old line, not install a new line - he was very helpful and got whatever the fault was resolved.

During the calls prior to the engineer visit I was told by a really helpful woman who was trying to help resolve my issues that I have 713 BT wifi hotspots where I live so signed up immediately - no hotspot in range. Another ¬£39 taken under false circumstances.

Phoned the next day (Saturday) and was told to reduce the package to remove the halo stuff which I was mis-sold and cant use would cost ¬£12 more than advertised, that the SIM would be cancelled and I would be transferred to another person to sort out the broadband cost. Transferred to another person only to be told that nothing can be done as there is an open order to cancel my SIM so I would have to call back on the next working day.

It was only when I absolutely lost my s**t at the poor guy I was speaking to that he spoke to his manager and agreed it would all get sorted on Monday without another phone call to them.

I cant believe how difficult and so utterly stressful this process has been. I can now understand why people get violent - I think I would have become uncontrollably violent if these people had been in front of me - and that is not my normal nature / presentation - I am usually calm, level headed and used to dealing with difficult situations / people. It was highly likely that I would lose my job if I didnt have a working broadband by the Monday which I explained over and over again but the only person who seemed to care about this was the helpful woman I spoke to who unfortunately wasnt able to resolve the issues for me. Thankfully the engineer sorted this for me.

The last guy I spoke to re reducing the package to one I can actually use helped me get things sorted once I completely lost my mind.

I wait to see that everything has been done.

Unfortunately I cannot recommend BT at all and if I wasnt at risk of losing my job on Monday if my broadband wasnt working I would have cancelled everything today!!!!!",0

"Ordered broadband and telephone during Black Friday deals and booked installation for 29/12/2022. Today on the day of installation the engineer arrived and informed me that cabling hasn‚Äôt been installed due to a block and would be installed in February 2023! Virgin media failed to tell me this beforehand I even contacted them using their WhatsApp service asking if I was ready for installation a week before. Virgin also failed to tell my existing provider that the installation would not be going ahead who had already put the cancellation through. Virgins negligence almost left me without internet and nearly lost my telephone number which I have had for 20 years! Luckily my existing provider, Plusnet, was able to urgently stop the cancellation and reinstated my services. Terrible customer service and experience from Virgin Media as a new customer. I have decided to cancel my Virgin order and will be staying with Plusnet
Update 30/12/22 - in response to their reply. Virgin media came out twice to my property in the first week of December and never informed me of a block until the day I had booked installation, 4 weeks later. You obviously DID know about the blockage yet didn‚Äôt keep me informed.

"I was literally scammed by vodafone.
I switched to Vodafone from another provider (which took a lot of effort and was already a red flag), and was told that I could pay ¬£8/month for 15GB on 5G. I signed up because it seemed like a good deal, got an email with the contract which clearly states the information I reported above, and activated my eSim. All was good for a couple of days until I realised that for some reason my phone was not using 5G anymore. It was on 4G all the time. I called Vodafone multiple times and had various chats with agents that didn't know what the issue was and made me download another eSim, until I got a message saying that although my phone is capable of 5G AND IT'S INCLUDED IN MY CONTRACT WHICH I WAS SENT VIA EMAIL, I would only be allowed to connect to 4G because when they signed me up they put me on a ""basic"" sim, which doesn't include 5G (again: that is DESPITE the contract saying that my contract DOES INCLUDE 5G).
It has been a truly unbelievable experience and I am now trying to get out of this contract.

-shortly before moving home I arrenged for an engineer for a new house and accepted their offer for future fibre > 2-3 days later get an sms and an email saying there is some problem with an order and unable to complete > whole week was calling them 1-2 hours every two days trying to sort things out (while preping to move 250 miles with 2 little kids) > couldn't find the reason of the problem (for hours and many different people/deps), so decided to cancell everything and finish with TalkTalk (I've been told I won't pay any early termination fees) > Iv'e even asked if they can offer me anything better and they propose me offer much worse than before (no sense) > for more than a week making sure everything is done (phone calls), found out that there is no confirmation of everything being cancelled (how can you be sure then? - read other revievs about what happened when they ""forgot"" to cancel the order for somebody)
-while being upset and calling, telling that the company doesn't work as it should and about you wasting time, some people pretend they can not hear you and they hang up the phone, or just put you on silence (yes, really)
-the whole customer service are quite nice and polite, but this is their job, so I don't expect any different, BUT what counts for me is their knowledge and professionalism which they lack
-what I found little funny was people apologizing to me and other customer service people apologizing to other customers in the background (you can hear other people when talking with them, so they must be crowded in their office)
-customer service is nice but they're BIG TIME WASTERS

Edit: Thanks Amii. I've wasted enough time with your company.

Edit2: It's few weeks after I left TalkTalk and cancelled everything, so it was surprising to receive an email from them yesterday:
""We‚Äôre pleased to confirm your engineer appointment. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about your full fibre installation(...)""

In 2 difrent amount. So you happy. 3 rd accident happened want to claim and you spending hours on hold and with different agent reporting yourself like you think you are in loop.

Yes duplicate account that's mean for nearly year you was pay two different amount for same phone. But after 6 weeks of battle suddenly they sort it out finally. Hurray received phone and you are happy user again. 4th life is unpredictable And you need claim for other phone. Think all was sorted last time so this time should be fine. Hahahahhaa never think like this. Now you her other account is missing your warranty paper ??? They confirm that I have insurance but without that warranty paper nobody can't do nothing. So you hear back office will call you in next 72 hours. Shame important message if you hear they will call you back hahahahhaha never been done. You have to chase them.
So we stuck with phone where display in going and simcard like with mogic wound disappearing and coming back. Wow.
Ohhh I forgot also what one on the person sad to us if you think you pay your insurance and when you claim will get brand new phone forget. They send you refurbish. But when you sign contract and hear about insurance that should be brand new phone. So that nice from 3 they send some one old phone fix to others and maybe by accident they will give my data etc new is new and that's why we pay for insurance Scam.


Update 14/09/2022 : like everyone see they ask to contact with someone over chat. They send link, so I copy and paste. And only I can see pls try later no available agent. Hahahah what a joke. Also I contact with three insurance and same thing collect same data what others do in previous calls and now I heard pls be patient they will contact up to 72 hours and later I heard they will contact I few days. Apologies and that's it just say goodbye. And I bet no one will contact with me. And when I will contact with someone will be heard same story and that I need be patient.
Bravo
My phone is still damage and I can't claim my policy.


Edit 20/02022
Still haven't fix or replace my phone and best thing insurance company sad I don't have a insurance with them. Because they ask 3 to confirm with rong IMEI number.",0
"Better alternative: Hyperoptic

PROs
+ A great example of what Brexit gives you: less choice, worse service and higher prices <3
+ You get slow internet for a high price because you live in an old house in London
+ Broadband comparison websites claim I can get up to 500Mbps, but when I check on Vodafone

CONs
- Website broadband speed check does not load due to timeout on both mobile and desktop
- Website chat does not load on mobile
- Cannot login despite correct email, order number, PIN and temporary password due to errors with the web platform
- Max 65Mbps for 19GBP in London while other areas easily get 1000Mbps (1Gbps) for 36GBP
- Impossible to buy internet online if you spent 3 years prior abroad. You need to waste 1h speaking to someone on the phone who puts stuff into their outdated system
- 5 unnecessary emails to confirm you got internet and that your router will be on its way eventually
- Router was supposed to arrive on 22nd Mar 2022 but I am still waiting. Go live is on 31st Mar 2022, so not much time left
- Huge, ugly, black router with massive power supply but mediocre coverage",0
"I really wish I could leave 0 stars!
Trust me when I say...AVOID NOW BROADBAND AT ALL COSTS!
Comedy of errors before we were connected. Engineer didn't turn up and NOW agent REFUSED to acknowledge if the engineer was going to attend or not!
Requested to cancel the service with a different agent to be told ""sorry you can't cancel it""... excuse me? Soon changed his tune when I quoted him my statutory rights and NOW's own terms and conditions.
Been promised twice by 2 different agents that they will confirm my cancellation request by email, but guess what? No surprise that they haven't.
Shoddy, abysmal service, fronted by monkeys who think they can intimidate you into staying with them.

"I had someone knock on my door despite having a sticker saying that I don't buy or sell at this property. The guy repeatedly told me that he wasn't selling anything, kept asking me personal information and was very pushy. Eventually, he told me that all I needed to do was sign up to BT in order to get the supposed great deal. How is that not buying or selling?? He also then knocked on the door later that evening and ran away up the road I have tried several ways to contact BT directly but it is almost impossible to raise an issue.",0

"Ordered a phone on Thursday, it told me next day delivery, got contacted Friday telling me I need to call a number, was on hold for 20 minutes before I got through to a person, they wanted bank details to make a 0.01p payment at 1pm, was told all done, next day delivery so be in Saturday if possible, stayed in all Saturday, no confirmation or delivery text, I presume it won't come Sunday, not even an email saying it's been shipped, so it's looking like it's going to be shipped Monday at earliest to be here Tuesday, so ""next day delivery"" is actually 5 day atleast.",0
"I have had a dreadful experience with Carphone Warehouse in Lisburn NI. Simply they are hood-winking customers. Yesterday I bought a SAMSUNG A20S SIM FREE Phone. The problem is when I got it home I noticed a label on the package. It said the phone had been opened, modified and resealed. Now when you go onto samsung com/uk/support/mobile-devices/what-is-a-modified-product it states >>>>> The phone has been altered and is NOT APPROVED BY SAMSUNG. SAMSUNG state it `` could be a poor or dangerous user experience``. The Salesman said `` It was ok to sell them and it was because they could not get stock from Samsung that they were buying elsewhere. Samsung state , ```THE PRIMARY ISSUE is that customers are NOT told they are buying a product that has been modified``. TRADING STANDARDS today said this was misleading !!! This warrants going to the press. Carphone Warehouse are , it appears, being forced to trade in unethical channels to source products during coronavirus. !!!

A copy of this is going to the CEO / Managing Director, Government Agencies , Consumer Groups and Social Media. I am not someone who complains easily but at 57 years old it sickens me that this is allowed to happen.

WHAT does your CEO / MD say to this Jim in Carphone Warehouse?

The Phone was purchased at 14:27:59 on the 28/07/2020 in Lisburn CURRY`S Superstore for ¬£149.99.

Absolutely check you are not being sold a repackaged phone as NEW !!!!",0
"If I could have, I would have given zero stars. This must be the worst Internet service provider ever. Despite their speeds exceeding 250 MB per second. The Internet frequently loses connectivity. We have called every day because we work from home, but the number of dropouts has rendered this practise untenable. Numerous engineers have appeared. Virgin Media does not appear to be interested in resolving the issue. I would never again subscribe to Virgin Media. We have never received an apology or any gesture of goodwill. They are utterly abhorrent. Plymouth area.",0
"Apologies for being long, but had to describe the situation to show other people how rubbish, unprofessional, overpromising and underdelivering this company is. It is a shame that nothing in my review is a lie.

In the middle of October a lady came knocking on our door and offered us an 'amazing' deal. 500mbps broadband for ¬£30, BT will reimburse us for any cancellation fee with the previous provider. We went for it. So we signed up for it and were waiting to be contacted when it would happen. Days went by and no one contacted us. We called the BT helpline, totally unhelpful, could tell us when it will happen but assured us someone else will give us a call the next day. We received a text message with the time window of the call. But guess what no one called. So we called again and explained the situation to another advisor, they told us it will be 18.11. and someone will call us 24 hours before to confirm. But guess what, no one called us. So AGAIN we called the BT helpline - not helpful twice - EXPLAIN again all situation around, the advisor did not know a thing to what can happen and when, just that he will send us a small EE router with 4G so we can use it if we do not have broadband and that again someone will call us on Saturday 19.11.2022. But again, guess what, NO ONE DID. On Monday evening we called again, explained the situation AGAIN and demanded ANSWER when we will get broadband installed. We have Netflix, Alexas connected to broadband and one of us is working from home and had to take an emergency holiday. No connection means no work to be done. We asked the smart advisor to give us an email where we can officially complain - manager's email or head office email. She told us to google it and how we should if we do not have broadband? When we gave her this reason, she hung up on us. REALLY????? So we called the BT rubbish helpline and explained the situation AGAIN and wanted to complain about the smart advisor. She told us they need to wait for an engineer report that is installing cables in our area and after an engineer appointment can be made. We asked, how long does it take and she said around 5 days. SHOCKING! I told her this is not acceptable, that we are without broadband because of their failed promise to deliver. Apparently she logged the complaint about the advisor and sent it to higher places. I doubt that. She again offered us a mini router for 4G. I told her we have one and it is absolute rubbish. She confirmed it will work with only one device. I asked her if my partner will be connected to that, me and my daughter should watch the wall as nothing else will work, or if one person is watching netflix, no one can use phone or laptop or watch anything on second TV. 'All I can do is to say we are sorry'. This sentence is absolutely not helpful, resolution nowhere to be found and we were left without broadband and frustrated. And to our surprise this morning we have received a text message saying the engineers appointment will happen on 13.1.20223.
Pardon my French, this is taking a p*ss out of customers. Original appointment was meant to happen 18.11.2023 and the new one is almost 2 months later? What we meant to do for 2 months without broadband? Full of frustration I called the helpline to raise my issue to ANOTHER person AGAIN from the beginning. NOT RESOLVED so I resigned from the lovely contract. NOW we are left with ¬£300 cancellation fee bill, no broadband home and anger and frustration.",0

"Harrogate.

Salesman disinterested. Oblivious to my mother's unfamiliarity with online sales / ordering items for pick up - required because her item was on display but not in stock. Promised next day arrival for pick up. Of course, it didn't arrive as promised. I needed to assist her with pick up but couldn't be there when item was delivered 24 hours after promise.

Then call centre unable to re-route delivery to home. Only thing they could offer was cancellation and order of new item for home delivery. Couldn't refund immediately (but managed to accept payment immediately) - would have to wait 5 days. They would then have had 2 payments

Whole system stacked against customer.

My mother will probably never shop at Currys again.",0
Do not waste your money or time. I have a faulty tv under warranty and have sent it in for repair once. They had TV for 9 days and found an ‚Äúunrelated fault‚Äù and claimed to have ‚Äúfixed‚Äù it. Sent it back to me with the original fault. I have video and pictures of the fault. They are refusing to replace TV as they claim not to be able to replicate. What a waste of money for this paid policy. I am now stuck with a broken TV they will not replace. DO NOT BUY THIS POLICY.,0

Reported the fault for the 3d time at the weekend. 2 days later heard nothing, rang this evening and spoke to a woman at BT who told me there was nothing wrong with the line - flatly contradicting 2 engineers and the person who reported the fault to on Saturday who checked the line and told me there was a fault. She thought she knew better than these 3 people and told me there was no fault on the line and I should go and buy a new phone. When I tried explaining what the previous engineers had told me she made it clear she did not want to listen and terminate the call. At no point was I rude in any way at all, although she was - she simply did not wish to do her job. Utterly disgraceful. If BT do not sort this quickly I am off.",0

"Appalling customer service.

I went abroad with 12GB of data and received a message after 7 days that I had used 8GB from WhatsApp and Google maps. I then bought an unlimited data package as the sales assistant had told me I could top up.

The data then completely stopped working and I had no means of navigating around a foreign country. I contacted customer service 4 times and was told every time that I was a liar and that I had used all my data. Only when the package refreshed did they realise that it couldn't connect to a local network. However they still insisted I had used all my data and refused to refund me for the unlimited data.

I also had a horrendous experience in 2018 when a contract I pay for got a bill for ¬£300 despite me requesting that data roaming be completely deactivated and told it had been. More fool me for going back.",0
"It all started when I got a call from Carphone, where they said I can upgrade my phone 3 months early so they offered me a contract on an iPhone 11 with the upfront cost of ¬£115. They said they will send the phone the following week.

As I didnt recieve any updates or emails regarding my purchase, I decided to call customer services to get a status. The guy in customer service then told me that I dont have a phone coming, but they said I have ¬£115 on my account?? They sent me to a sale exec and she ended up sorting me out with a new deal telling me that the deal offered was also on a new contract. She created me a new contract which she sold to me saying its the same thing. I proceeded to only realise there were tons of hidden costs (¬£135 approx) which led me to return the phone.

I have since called their customer support who are absoutely useless as they kept hanging up or mis informing me.

Turns out the sales exec mis sold me a new contract which has now resulted in an effect to my credit score.

Carphone warehouse have now been reported to the FCA as well as Watchdogs. See you on TV",0

"Got my oven installed and underneath the shelf for the oven, I had a drawer. I asked the guys installing it at the start to just remove it or pull it out if it's in the way of the oven. Turns out it was in the way but instead of doing anything or at least letting me know, they left it in. I now have a drawer that I can't move and an oven with a door that I can't fully open. I didn't find out until they left and I've been unable to reach anyone other than the webchat agents who keep telling me to call repairs but they won't pick up. They even left a big piece of wire in the oven which then started burning because the oven was turned on as it's supposed to be right after installation. This is not the first time that an installation has not been worth the money but it is the last as I will not be using Knowhow again. I now have to find someone else to fix the oven for me and frankly, even if I did manage to reach repairs, I'm not sure I would trust them. Customer service has not been helpful and has done nothing to try to compensate for the extra time and money that this is costing me.

I immediately ran out to see if the delivery guy was there but we just missed him. I called customer service who dealt with this situation like this was not their problem. I‚Äôm so mad that I didn‚Äôt get this ladies name but the call was on loud speaker and made my son record the conversation , I explained what happened and she told me she had to ring the store which was fine , after a 10 minute hold I was then told that this was impossible and that all their products are checked before shipping, the person that packaged the items apparently confirmed this, so this is where I‚Äôm about to lose my cool because now this conversation is now beginning to sound suggestive, I asked her ‚Äúif it‚Äôs been checked like you say you do then what are you suggesting? That my son opened them and took them out and make it look like they were never there, sorry my love that‚Äôs not in our nature and is a big deformation of our characters , I was then told to take it up as a dispute with my credit card company, I asked to speak to a manager as I did not like the way this conversation was going to be told no , I asked 3 times , i politely thanked the lady and hung up. I called again and once connected no one poke as I said hello the call ended 3 times in a row I asked my wife to call from her phone and guess what? She got straight through , I was passed the phone spoke to a gentleman who basically said sn investigaton will take place and now I have to wait 48 hrs for a response and still unable to speak to a manager even though this was my opening question to the start of our conversation ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Now here‚Äôs the thing before I could explain further due attitude of this staff member I wasn‚Äôt fully able to elaborate on this evenings event And now I don‚Äôt want to even speak to anyone else from this terrible establishment and quite frankly I don‚Äôt care about the situation especially after basically been called out to be a thief, given the chance I would have explained that my son had been filming the whole thing so this whole experience will be on full display of how they treats customers, I willl never ever buy from this place ever again that‚Äôs for sure

I spent half an hour on the phone to customer services who could not help without a contract number which is not visible on the contract.
I went back to the manager in aylesbury who told me I can't cancel my contract there is no 14+ grace period. (even though my contract doesn't start until end of Dec??? I was also told by CS,that there is no email address for me to write and complain to?? So I have wrote a letter to the manager and formally terminated my contract photographed it for proof and handed it to the manager who promptly ripped it up. I've found the whole experience of 3 and the manager at Aylesbury downright rude, unhelpful, dismissive and most certainly not customer orientated whatsoever.

I did not want a refund by check as this will cause me inconvenience and waste of my time to take the check to the bank. She advised that the only way Carphone Warehouse can refund the money on my card by cancelling the order.

* After moving to Pay Monthly the app never worked for me again, despite multiple customer service calls and reinstalls. The app opened - but my data or plan information was always ""unavailable"".

* A couple months into my Pay Monthly plan I realised I had mistakingly signed up for some type of international plan that cost +¬£20/month. I raised this multiple times with customer service but was told there was nothing I could do until my contract ended after 24 months.... so they essentially screwed me out of ¬£500 pounds because I ""didn't read the fine print"" vs. fixing the situation and making me a happy & loyal customer.

* A month after my contract expired, I called because my bill remained at my previous Pay Monthly level (even though my device was paid off). There was a ""glitch"" in their system, so that was another ¬£50 or so they would have continued to charge me every month had I not been paying attention.

* The website is awful. They push you to the website on a regular basis for 24/7 support or for self-service, but I often found myself navigating in circles and ultimately reaching dead-ends telling me I needed to contact customer service.

* Don't get me started on the call wait times. Yikes!

Vodafone is the worst. Service is OK I guess, but doesn't seem to be any great service provider in the UK... but they sure can't get any worse than Vodafone!",0

I ordered from ghd website over a month ago and the first time I emailed them about my curler still not arriving for them to tell me that it went missing with the courier and that they‚Äôd send me out a new one which was fair enough.I decided to email the week after about a tracking number because i would have personally liked to know where it is it‚Äôs not cheap and I didn‚Äôt want it going missing again! I didn‚Äôt hear anything so I emailed another two time in that week to which I was ignored so today I decided that I‚Äôm not waiting any longer so I requested a refund to which I got an email back within the hour saying that it was never sent because it went out of stock (but I was told it was sent out and to give it 5-7 working days to be delivered) and now I‚Äôm waiting on my refund‚Ä¶ avoid,0
"Yet again BT have messed up our phone bill, this time charging for a reconnection that never happened (no mention of the disconnection that logically would have preceded it and also didn't happen !). This is on the back end of at least five serious errors over the last 18 months that ended up at the chairman's office for several months before we were compensated. Trying to get through about the latest debacle is impossible, just kept on hold being told how important my call is to them. I can't find one single positive to say about this abysmal company. Looks like it's the chairman's office again then !

Update re BT's reply. I don't use social media and 0800 800 150 is what i'm repeatedly ringing and getting no reply. You could get in touch with me via trust pilot but choose not to. Your reply is meaningless and in no way helpful, as i'd expect of BT.",0
I bought an ex display 3080ti but it has been a nightmare start to end. It arrive loose in a box wrapped in a thin layer of bubble wrap. The IO bracket was bent but after a quick power on the card was working so I straightened the bracket as any person would as it was just the tabs that were bent and I was happy with the card for a few days. The a driver update happened. My screen went black and stayed black with the motherboard error code for no VGA. Looking over the card I could see that the warranty sticker was damaged so I have a suspicion the card had been tampered with or altered at some point. I contacted Ebuyer to enquire about a RMA but was told since straightened the bracket they would not help. They won‚Äôt even acknowledge the damaged warranty sticker or that they voided MSI‚Äôs warranty when they sent it out with what may as well be no packaging. If you‚Äôre going to resell a ex display at least keep hold of the proper packaging or how about putting them in a pre built instead. I feel like this ex display unit is a con to resell broken products.,0
Dreadful streaming service. 10 quid a month and they still show adverts during some shows like House of the Dragon. What?!?!?! Not much in the way of good shows either. Don't waste your money get Netflix instead.,0

Tricked me in to thinking I was getting a 128GB iPhone 8 which I said I wanted when I walked in. Months later discovered it was a 64GB when finding I was low on space. Also only 1 year warranty but 3 network give 2 years. Needed warranty cps microphone doesn‚Äôt work and not even dropped or damaged the phone. Just a rubbish phone in general really plus rubbish service for this firm,0
"I ordered from deliveroo and my order did not arrive. I contacted customers service to get my order refunded at the very least and unfortunately had responses stating 'there will be no compensation' from Queen annacelle, rebekah danielle, leizel and gregg (none of which were able to show evidence of looking into my case for a refund). I was charged ¬£31 for my order from purley sainsburys and all customer service agents gave me the same standard response without a fair review of the incident. If the delivery person is lost they should call you for directions! The reviews on here show that deliveroo is not fit for purpose and therefore will be gone before long. DO NOT USE SCAM COMPANY!",0

"I will be sending a letter of complaint as the service is appalling! Let down on 2 installation dates, which isn't good when you work online and have no internet! This also means I lost money and I will be applying for compensation. The day before the first installation date, they moved the date out 3 weeks, with no apology! Then I needed permission from the neighbour, which they knew about 3 weeks prior. I feel it was used as a delay tactic as that was just before the New Years holiday, so everyone was away. Why was I expected to obtain this and not Virgin? Why did they leave it 3 weeks before advising this requirement? I'd just moved house and hadn't met my neighbour at that stage. Thankfully, she is lovely and tried to help as much as possible. Virgin did not advise anyone of the actual work required, they just expected my neighbour to sign! To date, I still have no idea what's happening, nobody responds, nobody apologises, they just expect you to wait! I've now canceled Virgin and my god, that was just as painful! How can they continue to get away with this appalling service?

Virgin - Why don't you call me with an update!",0

"I don't often have an issue with Very. Made an order on the 14th December only to discover an issue with the shipping label (via Yodel, they weren't able to send my item), so the items were returned to Very. Since then I've not been able to get in contact with Very as it only offers a phone number and the Chat Bot is of no help in these situations. I just have an order that I will probably never receive (that I no longer want) that I will unfortunately have to pay for any way.",0
"My son returned an unwanted game to CEX Chelmsford and was given a voucher even though we paid cash. OK I thought, he wanted another game so we‚Äôll just have to get it from CEX. Chelmsford didn‚Äôt have the game he wanted so I looked online and saw that Romford had 3. So I battled the traffic, paid for parking only to be told that they had none in stock. Later I looked online to find that they had 2 in Braintree so I ordered it from there hoping to collect today. I have now received the email saying that the order has been cancelled because it is not in saleable condition.
So what is up with the stock control? And where now is my voucher? If it‚Äôs not in saleable condition then do that before you put it online. I‚Äôm going to try and order online for delivery but I‚Äôm not holding out much hope and already feel like I‚Äôve lost my money.",0

"Reported to Watchdog and the BBC. Not being treated like this.

Poor customer service. Sent a working phone in following an upgrade. I have a video of the phone working. They have said the phone is not working and instead of paying the 235 stated they are giving 35 pounds.

Scam completel scam. They will not honor deals and find a fault to avoid paying value agreed for phone.

Terrible company and poor customer service. Avoid.

Mine was an upgrade offer of extra 100 plus phone price of 135. Being told I will only get 35.

Do you ever pay out on trade ins or always find a mysterious and made up fault.

Oh and you can never speak to anyone or get a response. I spoke to customer services as my new phone arrived damaged told me none in stick to give me a replacement, however online I could re order the phone for next day delivery. So load of rubbish. Told me to try and speak to store gave me out several store numbers none answered. After speaking to someone in customer services for the 6th time that day they finally told me no stores answering due to covid and so just to go to store. Why did 5 previously customer service staff give out stores numbers when none answering so to devote time to in store customers following covid??

I have proof working in a video form I took before I posted because I had heard awful company. Should have listened and not use them. Avoid people.

I have read were people have had the same issue and so feel like Carphonewarehouse need to answer why this is. I suspect never plan on giving anyone the extra 100 trade in offer because they will always find a fault thats not a fault to blame on that so only ever have to pay out phone value and not offer. And by the time they respond to tell you not getting full trade in value you are stuck in the contract paying perhaps a higher value than you would have and paid out for phone when wouldnt have done that.

Don't be fooled by deals and cheap contracts. Reason for that!!



Just reading more comments funnily enough like many other comments my phone has screen burn apparently. Complete scam. I will be reporting to trading standards because an absolute disgrace. Disgusting. No intention on ever paying the quote.

Funny the phone has screen burn but not when I sent it off and not shown in my viedoe the day I posted. If screen burn you would clearly see this. Just an excuse not to pay out and get phone cheap. Shambles of a company. Disgusting behaviour.

I am not leaving it there. If my phone is now damaged I will be taking this so far. Because there is no way I will be accepting my phone damaged by Carphonewarehouse. I can prove how it was when sent and should I get anything less than that I will continue and push my complaint as far as I can. I will report to watchdog. The ombudmans. Trading standards. I am not being treated like this.

Screen burn...liars. seems to be the standard excuse for carphone warehouse to avoid payment. Poor company. Who runs a company like that should be beyond embarrassed. How can you treat people in such a way. How do you sleep at night.",0
Their call center keep making cold calls on my number to take some mobile plan from them. Even after asking them not to call they don't stop.

"What a waste of time from vodafone customer service. I wanted to cancel my broadband, took me 1 hour of waiting and talking to people who could not help.

I damaged my laptop a month ago and not only have they told me that I will have no contact with the repair team, I was urged by an employee to buy a USB drive to back up my files for ¬£20.

One complaint after the other, they finally told me that the laptop was written off and they then proceeded to wait another 10 days before providing me with an e-voucher to purchase a new laptop.

All this and not only did I receive no communication, I also have yet to receive this necessary usb drive which I was told to buy. I still DONT KNOW when this will arrive.

To make matters worse, I have no way of contacting a complaints team as nobody replies and is able to help me with my enquiry.",0

"I ordered my daughters main Christmas present from carphone warehouse/Currys (iPhone 13 pro) this was a upgrade from Iphone 11, this was ordered November to be delivered before 23rd dec, which I was told would be the very latest it would arrive at my local Currys store. I then recieved 2 emails on the morning of the 17th dec from carphone warehouse and dpd with the time my phone would be delivered to store then a later email with the picture of my delivery being delivered, that same day I received another email from carphone warehouse 8 hours after it had been delivered to store to say my order had been cancelled. I then went to the store frantic as it‚Äôs less than a week till Christmas to be told oh we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happened to your order it‚Äôs just cancelled. To the manager absolutely shaking with guilt didn‚Äôt have anything to tell me other than ring customer service even when I showed email with photo of my phone in their store he didn‚Äôt even say I will check to see if it‚Äôs in the back because he clearly knew where the phone had gone I then rang customer service while at the store, where they told me someone at the store must have it and they must of cancelled your order manger still denied this. Customer service then said we have done are part and delivered to store it‚Äôs upto you to take it up with the store. I have never dealt with such unprofessionalism in my life to say both company‚Äôs are a absolute joke. I have suffered serve stress because of this which is having lasting effects on my mental health. I feel physically sick and I have no idea what to say to my daughter as this will probably be the last year in believing in Father Christmas surely no manager of a big company can get away with stealing other peoples delivery‚Äôs and just get away with it, I‚Äôve spoken with a friend who worked with carphone warehouse and they have said orders sometimes get cancelled a short time after ordering due to being out of stock but never a Order being cancelled once the phone had been delivered, and the only explanation for this is that someone in the workplace has the phone and the manger being the only person with authority to cancel it on the system! Absolutely disgrace of a company! I intend to take this further.",0

"I recently purchased a new phone, and used the Trade Up option, as they offered me ¬£75 for my old phone. The new phone was a little more expensive then a few other retailers, but with the trade up it seemed a good deal.
I was very wrong!! The new phone was delivered, and then I received the packaging to send my old phone in. Several weeks later I received an email stating the old phone was faulty and instead of ¬£75 they offered ¬£15. This took me by surprise as the phone was perfect and had no faults when I posted it. I replied immediately as one of the options was to have the phone returned. However all emails were ignored, around 5 were sent and the phone turned up five weeks later. I powered up the phone and it works perfectly, no faults at all. I therefore complained but my emails were again ignored until I contacted Curry's customer service. Several more emails but they are not much help and quite abrupt.
