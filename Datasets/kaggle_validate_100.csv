"I couldn't make an official review on a product on the app so I came here, my mum bought my son an inflatable chair, it's very small, it deflates itself and eventually ends up with a hole in it, twice this has happened as my mum bought another to replace the first and yet again deflates itself and a hole was made in the exact same place coincidently. Its a bad product anyone who reads this remember ""paw patrol inflatable chair"" I expect products from argos to be more sustainable guess not...",0
"Fantastic! Extremely easy to use website, fantastic range of batteries, fantastic packaging , dispatch and delivery service and all of that at fantastic prices! A first class company to deal with üëç",1
So far annoyed as hell with this bt monthly pass. Its not easy as abc to get the app on TV. I want to watch on TV not on my phone. Not everyone is computer clever. Cant wait to cancel the damn thing. Why can't it be easy .,0
Correct replacement delivered on time now my vac is working again Thank you,1
"Now Tv have the worst Broadband, it has gotten progressively worse and they refuse to up their quality. Do not join their services",0
"Everything happened as you said, delivery great and on time, cannot fault whatsoever and will use again.",1
"Quick and fast delivery. Website was easy to use, had no issues and came next day with free delivery.",1
This is by far the most shocking experience I‚Äôve ever had. I am a disabled person who made and order from Wing stop. Just like the many other orders I‚Äôve made over the years. Today the courier couldn‚Äôt get through to me? Even though I was in! They said they tried and tried. So they left the food outside. Who on earth leaves food outside. And to make things worse Deliveroo refuse to refund me for food I didn‚Äôt get. Sadly i dont have the funds for this. So am leaving this to warn people of this shocking and unacceptable behaviour Shame on you! Courier 1928 PS this is not a dis on WingStop. They‚Äôre Excellent .just dont use Deliveroo!!!!!!!!,0
Easy instructions to follow on site & very efficient service. Quick delivery & good quality product,1
"Very pleasant experience today with both customer service and Tech support, Have had a couple of issues over the two years when speaking to customer service, but they have just been poorly trained or bad at the job!. 95% if the time it's 5 star service. Certainly compared to BT and Vodafone which are both terrible. Have renewed for another year hopefully will be hassle free again üôÇ",1
"Fast hassle free. Mean what they say and say what they mean. Would definitely recommend and will use them in the future.

Nice website. Easy to find what you want. Competitive pricing. Swift delivery. Careful packaging. Detailed installation instructions. Excellent after-sales support in the unlikely event it is needed.,1

Brilliant unbiased help the management and staff must be applauded,1
I explained exactly what problem was when booking. Said heater wasn‚Äôt working. Engineer turned up without the part. Three days later still waiting for call back as to when they will return with the part to fix it,0
"My Son‚Äôs 1st birthday invites are absolutely fantastic. You do some really good products that are priced well. The turnaround time and dispatch time were excellent. My only slight issue is the personalisation tool online isn‚Äôt always very user friendly, it can take a while to use.",1
Always received my parcels on time good value for the money too.,1
"Contacted the t.v. department, the chap was very helpful. I explained what I wanted, he checked and ordered the item I wanted.",1

For quality items at a reasonable cost with fast delivery go no further that this company. GREAT,1
"The price was competitive, the ease of how to order was simple and the delivery was on time. Overall fantastic",1
Ordered my item on Friday and delivered to Weymouth on Sunday afternoon. Delivery guys CraigD & Dave i s were very friendly and helpful. Best price on the web for my item and free delivery. I have used this company 4 or 5 times now and have never let me down,1
"More than a month after a technical fault in my area, I am still without a phone line or broadband. I've been on the phone more than a dozen times with them. BT keep giving me ""expected fix dates"", but no one ever shows up. I understand that these things may take time, but the constant lying is deplorable.",0
I did not receive the order and actually I would like to return it because I do no longer need it,0
Great and really good service and easy to purchase stuff,1
Very had the best price for what I bought and it was very quick delivery,1

"Faultless from start to finish, easy to follow instructions with fast payment. Highly recommended and will definitely recommend and use again",1
I tried an alternative company who offered less than advertised so tried Mazuma Mobile who delivered as promised. Very pleased with all aspects of the selling process.,1
Very helpful assistant very knowledgeable,1
Pictures are blurry on my photo book and part of my order hasn‚Äôt arrived!,0
"Still waiting for my refund, 25th day now and still nothing; can refunds escalated contact me asap.

Also just got hung up on by your customer service rep (didn‚Äôt say anything bad but isn‚Äôt or patching me to the right department for a resolve I was hung up on instead).",0
"Worst repair company with a big name, I am getting a pair of headphones repaired which are faulty again after they was sent off for repair to team knowhow, these headphones where brought in on the 07/09/20 and was due for return on the 15/09/20, i received a text on the 14/09/20 stating they have arrived so I went to collect them, they was not there, the customer service assisant basically said they might come tomorrow wait for a call. that was literally all the help I got. she didn't make a call to enquire or do any work to help provide any actual information she just sent me away, so my time and money was wasted. upon trying to call to enquire as the tracking code on the text didn't work (which is 5p minute I may add) you will find every option on the call service for repairs will lock you off once you get to the end so it is literally there to drink your money while you think your waiting for help. as of today 19/09/20 I have received no help and have even tweeted them to try to get some actual assistance which they asked for a ref number which turns out the one they provided in the text doesn't work for me or them. currently I'm in a position where they have my product indefinitely with no date or information on when they will be ready...be careful when getting the breakdown cover when the product cost enough to be sent away Usually on a ¬£200+ product, it may be better to use a different company for repairs then teamknow how.",0
I'm very happy happy with my purchase and how easy everything was to get done.,1
"I would never use this company again .
I ordered from Ireland an iPhone 6S in good condition .I duly paid the cost of postage to ship it here .
Quick fix claim that all their phones are all checked out before despatch .
This handset must have been the one to slip through the net as its not fit for purpose . Battery has major issues and after all the advise by email from quickfix customer service as to methods to fix the problem it's the same .battery won't hold a charge and after hrs of charging with a genuine apple charger it's flat in 10 mins
Then it's got 30% then 10% all over the place !!!!this phone should NEVER!!! BEEN SENT OUT LIKE THIS .
My issue is that they want me to cover the postage costs both ways for them to check it out .,(something possibly that should have already been done ?) From Ireland .
I already paid postage to have it sent here based on their false description of condition - absolutey disgracefully !!
Shame on you and a waste of my money .",0
I was pleasantly surprised - they l communicate well and phone was as described,1
"Got a great deal, delivery was quicker than expected.",1
"They charge 5 a day for overseas data, beware! I paid 150 cause I was working remotely for a month, ID and Virgin are not charging a penny for that!",0
"Very bad coustomers service, food delivery took 2 hours and 30 min, no compensation. I would give 0 stars if this would be possible.",0
"Great prices, service and support.",1
Brilliant service very fast delivery and well packaged,1
"I found my time there
Helpful informative
Answered all my questions
Thank you",1
"Great service,friendly deliver people.Gave a call to say they were on their way.",1
"Sent me a item that was damaged and had clearly been returned previously. Customer services rude and unhelpful.

Could not sent me a replacement only refund, it helpful for a item I needed quickly (paid for same day delivery)

Stick to Amazon!",0
"Very disappointed with ebuyer my son ordered some very expensive computer equipment and paid extra for delivery the company that were supposed to deliver it well that was a absolute joke and have no regard for people property the Items arrived late at first we thought they had been stolen only to find that they had been delivered to my next door neighbours garden fence that been placed on the fence and left for two days in torrential rain, this matter isn‚Äôt over by a long shot and I will be contacting trading standards, all ebuyer have told my son that there looking into haven‚Äôt even offered to refund the delivery cost, whst a joke.",0
Don't do it. Utter garbage. Identified an internal fault as my internet was constantly dropping out. Arranged an engineer visit then closed my case the day before and no engineer visited. I've come to the conclusion you can save money by opting for a crap provider like these but the 20p a day you save is simply not worth it.,0
Arthur M was very informative and helpful with my query and sent me an email confirmation of our conversation.,1
"Avoid avoid please
Three times my food didn‚Äôt arrived,i was waiting outside for the drivers and they didn‚Äôt stop and after they said the couldn‚Äôt deliver my food,i contact them they said they can‚Äôt give my money back because i didn‚Äôt answer the phone,i ask them to send me a proof the driver try to contact me and they couldn‚Äôt and i never received a refund or something.So avoid if you want to keep your money or they can steal your money and your food.very dissapointed",0
"After signing up to talk/talk as a New customer in 2019-2022, Everything that I was offered sounded like a really good deal, unlimited booster call, wifi, High speed internet, as I later found out, this is just to draw you in, making them sound so good! It‚Äôs when your contract comes to an end! Is when they truthful act comes, Asking you to pay more for the same service just laughable, so I told them I was struggling to pay, an through it would be best that I would leave, and find a deal with another company, I was told THREE TIMES that they could offer me the same deal as before but at a lower rate, what a lie!! And I only found out when I received second bill, I was not given the full facts on a new contract, Now it‚Äôs deadlocked..!!!",0
"Ordered some sheets for my sons new bed and arranged for them to be delivered to my local Sainsbury's.
Went in to collect at the weekend using the automated machine in the store. It said someone would be along to help. They didn't and i had stuff to do so i went back today. The young man told me, after putting the order number and bar code into his hand held device, that they did not have my order and i should speak to Argos.
I went online to try to sort this out and was told by the 'person' at the other end that there was nothing they could do as the order had been collected. Also advised me they will have cctv to prove its been collected.
I asked if the 'person' thought i was lying. They said its our process. Nothing they can do.
Amazing.
An order goes missing so either Sainsbury's staff are lying or the customer is.
Complaint made by calling customer services.
I want a refund and I'll buy off Amazon like everyone else.",0
Fast response from companies interested in doing the work.,1
"I've booked my broadband on 2nd of Feb for installation today, the engineer due to attend on an Am slot has had some apparent personal issue and has decided to not show up. Bt nor the engineer had notified me of this. Its only because I rang the engineer to no answer then had to ring bt customer service to be told this. Had I of known customer and engineer service would be so abysmal I would've not used bt as my provider",0
"I soooo regret ever going with Now broadband. Constant issues of router restarting and slow speeds. Took 2 weeks to fix once ringing everyday over a period of a week. To do exactly same thing a couple months later.

Funny thing is before Now I was on talktalk and never had one single issue and their router is so much better.

I will never be a customer of now or sky again. I will actually pay more to stay away from them.",0
"Just had a pizza delivered by one of their cyclists, all the topping was lying at one side of the box ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨absolute shambles of a company and my pizza was ruined.and yet another foreigner who can‚Äôt read a map properly, why employ such thick c**** ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨",0
Easy to use service and they look just as they did on the screen. Also arrived two days earlier than expected.,1
"Not really GHDs fault but due to delivery company leaving it outside ( I live in a block of flats), it‚Äôs been taken so I haven‚Äôt received my product yet. Have informed GHD and waiting for a response as to what can be done.",0
The order came when you said it would.,1
I ordered a refurbished phone in March 2021 and didn‚Äôt receive it. They promised a refund and in January 2022 still haven‚Äôt received it and they ignore my emails. Couldn‚Äôt get a charge back on my card either to the lapse time scale. Utterly disgusted by hey have gone from a great company to being fraudulent company.,0
"Do not use this company.. they are a complete bunch of charlatans. I have been lied to as I suspected, shortly after speaking to Huma in customer services a driver Ed Majeska rang to rudely say I'm not getting my tumble dryer today. I have just spent half an hour on the phone being passed around. Absolutely no one will help. I was accidentally passed to Leah Willows who organises the drivers. Her drivers hadn't kept her informed and have turned their phones off. Been told to ring them back again for the third time. Why didn't someone just call this morning to rearrange? Rang and spoke to Ben Rhodes and requested my call be escalated straight away but Managers do not take calls?! Left my number for a Manager to call. I had a call got an apology but that doesn't cut it. I've cancelled the order and will not be making any further purchases from Curry's. Please do not reply to this review I don't want anything whatsoever from you, you had your chance to provide a product and service and failed spectacularly.",0
"Absolutely useless company. Tried to install a washing machine with no basic plumbing equipment, flooded my kitchen and then basically ran away without telling me there was an almighty leak from one of the pipes in the kitchen cupboard! Remedial plumbing works were incredibly basic (capping off a pipe - absolutely out of the sphere of ability of the operatives) but cost me ¬£80 which I am now trying to recoup and being fobbed off by telephone operatives at every occasion. Utterly disgraceful, useless and inept at every turn. DO NOT BOTHER.",0
"I ordered a Simba Duvet and joined Very for this reason in the title description it said single white duvet yet you choose a size so I ticked King size.
Yet adding it to checkout it still stated Single I phoned Very to confirm why it would say this yet after a 16 minute wait to get through I was told as long as I have ticked King that will be what I receive. As I still didn‚Äôt trust what I was being told I also contacted Very via their Facebook messenger and explained the situation again I was told the same information.
So I went ahead and ordered and guess what an arrived a sing Duvet instead or the King size I needed and I still am non the wiser how they still have not changed this on their site.
I then had to ring Very again to arrange a pick up the next day for a return and refund so I had to stay home all day with no time slot or clue when the item would be picked up and I was also told I had to wait 7 working days for a refund which meant I couldn‚Äôt order the right size if I wanted to because I had to wait for a refund to re order all over again and the same situation could happen it‚Äôs like no one who works for very have any way to make sure a customer gets what they order and still no refund and the king size duvet is now out of stock so my first experience with VERY has not been very good at all.
I won‚Äôt be ordering from them in future.",0
Ordering process was simple. part arrived and was of good quality. Very Competitive pricing and appears to be good value for money spent.,1
Very good easy to order good d delivery,1
"I had been using NowTV for a few years, back when the entertainment pass was ¬£7.99 a month and had no ads!
Now its just shocking to see that in order to get the most out of it you pay a tenner for the movie pass, a tenner for the TV show pass, and now due to the fact they've added ridiculous adverts despite already paying a subscription they now have the cheek to offer the ""boost"" option for an extra fiver to get rid of the adverts? Ridiculous!
I don't want to have to sit through 2 minute long adverts during a movie or numerous 30 second adverts during a 25 minute TV show... It's an absolute con to be paying that sort of money when competitors such as Netflix and disney+ charge less than a tenner for far better content! (No ads, better quality, TV and movies on the same pass, and SUBTITLES).
Most things on nowtv don't have subtitles and the ones that do have subtitles stop working properly once an advert is finished which is simply just infuriating. It's not very accessible to not have working subtitles.
All of the above are just a few of the major flaws NowTV has. Until they are fixed I don't plan on subscribing to them again!",0
Waiting in all evening for payed delivery promised No contact phone lines busy and now found out online returned to depot. Poor poor poor,0
"Excellent service, very prompt replacement of faulty parts.",1
"very poor service . wrote to them twice about the phone having a fault and have had no reply . i am now returning the phone for a full refund . this company can't be trusted . please do not buy anything from these .
You have all the info ..so please don't start telling lies . i have alread started a return i have only had one reply that was today 24/1/23 .",0
"WORST COMPANY AND BIGGEST SCAM
Do not use them
data barely works I barely get signals anywhere, I made the biggest mistake by joining them they charge me 65¬£ every month for my data to not even work I made so many complaints and no changes stay away from them biggest scam ever",0
Absolutely useless no communication next day delivery took 9 nine days not very helpful when I chased up would not recommend or use again VERY POOR,0
"I'm actually speechless, that such a well known brand can deliver such an incredibly poor service. I ordered an upgrade on April 28th which I chose to return as I decided I wanted to change network. I received the phone on April 29th. The phone was returned in its original packaging unopened on April 30th via Royal mail special delivery and delivered on May 1st. I spoke to one of their representatives online informing them that I would like to cancel my upgrade. Instead of cancelling the upgrade, someone has taken it upon themselves to issue me with another contract minus a mobile phone and minus 12gb of data, for the exactly the same amount of money. Why on earth would any want to have a new two-year contract without a new phone and 12gb less data. This was done the following day after the phone had been returned. TEN EMAILS and another letter sent via Royal mail special delivery, asking for the upgrade to be cancelled. 22 days later and I'm still waiting. I can't switch networks with the same mobile number as Vodaphone won't terminate the contract without The Carphone Warehouse informing them that the phone has been returned. I wasted hours on webchats with their customer service reps only to realise that I was wasting my time. On two occasions members of their team refused to discuss the problem as they claimed that the details I gave them did not match with their records. After careful scrutiny I realised that the only detail that was different was that I typed Flat 364, instead of appartment 364. I asked the representative if this was issue, but she refused to discuss it any further and cut me off. Finally, I will conclude buy saying, if CPW don't have means to function at an acceptable standard, then they should be closed for business, during this period.",0
"Chose Three specifically as I could put a zero price cap to prevent my disabled daughter from being tempted to click ""accept"" on every shiny advert and the subsequent bill... turns out Threes own ""Three Pay"" system can circumvent the cap, and guess what, this is the direct quote from the 'chat' with their operator ""... if we had any option to block this Three Pay services i would have got that activated for you""

I feel like I have been defrauded.",0
"Absolutely diabolical company, I signed up for the free trial,watched 1 program and there was literally nothing else for me on it so I cancelled. A month later I see money leaving my account and it had been for 3 months,I contacted customer help (that's a joke in itself) ,they did they'd refund me for 2 months,they could clearly see it had never been used but for whatever reason the subscription kept running, a month of emailing they kept saying they would refund and asking me to confirm,this went on and on and on,to cut a long and very boring waste of life story now tv customer service are dirt, dont use this company you'll regret it and the programs are rubbish. Dont sign up for a trail either because they keep charging after you cancel then blame you.

Do not use now tv you've been warned.",0
"Absolutely sh*te company. I topped up with a voucher which I was advised by their robot could be converted to a data pack / add-on / bolt-on or whatever which took me a f u c k i n g hour to do on the app, the robot said I‚Äôd get confirmation of its success within 15 minutes. It‚Äôs now been 18 hours and I‚Äôve had no confirmation of a data pack being applied, I have no ‚Äòcash credit‚Äô showing available yet have NO F U C K I N G DATA. I need to make f u c k i n g phone calls!! Where the f u c k has my money gone? I‚Äôll never get the answer cos they refuse to speak on the phone and during a live chat I was asked my name which I‚Äôd already confirmed one minute earlier, was told I‚Äôve got my own name wrong and the r*tard then referred to my card even thought I mentioned three f u c k i n g times I‚Äôd bought a voucher.

So they won‚Äôt refund me, won‚Äôt apply a data pack, my ‚Äòcash credit‚Äô has disappeared from showing ¬£10 available to ¬£0 yet I have NO F U C K I N G INTERNET ACCESS. Thieving, lying bad f u c k i n g helmets. AVOID!!

"I have had a washing machine covered for years. It recently lost complete power. Had 2 engineers come out each providing different reasons for the breakdown, both inaccurate. D&G have refused to replace the machine as it's unrepairable but then wanted to send out another engineer to investigate but cannot as THEY have closed my account without notifying me. Will not refund me for all the insurance premiums and only offered ¬£100. I have several appliances insured with them and will be taking my business elsewhere.",0
"I ordered the mens advent calendar BEFORE Christmas and the courier DUMPED my package outside and when I came home from work it‚Äôs been taken, where now on 11th December and studio has done NOTHING to help me sort my package out. Fraudsters!!! Specially using courier company like Hermes",0
"My delivery never came. I was in, nobody called. I get that accidents happen, people get lost, sometimes delivery drivers call the wrong house. But when I tried the online chat to sort out what had happened, they kept saying I'd been called and the doorbell rung. The driver apparently waited 11 minutes. I was literally sitting in the house right there and I know this was not true. But OK - supposing their records say otherwise, I get there's a conflict, but they refused to do anything to sort out the problem. I was charged a lot of money for food that never came. This is theft. Don't use this service in Chester.",0
"After hours spent trying to get through and getting cut off when they cant help. 2engineers sent but problem not fixed. No follow up calls from customer service. Absolutely appalling customer service. Would definitely not recommend. DON'T USE,",0
"Had a fault on the landline that Openreach can't rectify without putting in a new cable all the way down the street and that doesn't look like it is happening anytime soon. No dial tone no calls, luckily the broadband still works most of the time.
Now TV contracted to provide a phone line and Broadband-from May last year for one year. When asking for some compensation for this fault against the monthly charge, they swear blind that the Line rental is just the broadband charge since the 21st January - Nonsense, I didn't agree to any change, going to try Vodfone at ¬£20 per month",0
"I always pay my gas bill but I get demanding letters from SHELL saying that I have not paid my bill and that they are going to add on costs for recovery of the bill,I've received an email from someone at shell saying that he has seen that I have paid my bill and he has put an official complaint in on my behalf, he said that I will not receive any more demanding letters,but I've just received 2 more letters demanding that I pay immediately, I have been having this problem for the last 6 months and they still have not solved the issues. SHELL owe me ¬£89:31 from my old gas account and said that I would receive a cheque for the amount they owe me for over charging me for gas. I am still waiting for the cheque to arrive and so far it's been 3 weeks since I was told that I would be refunded.
For anyone who is going to get SHELL energy I would think twice about it as they are one of the worst companies for not getting things done, you pay your bills and then for the next few months they send you demanding payment letters.
I will not even give them 1 star ,I'm a 70 year old pensioner and it's not nice getting threatening letters for money I've already paid.
Thank you",0
An absolute joke! Manager Hannah at the Blackburn office is a disgrace to the company.,0
Do not buy the white wifi dongle (2021 model) from this company. It has appalling battery life and the signal keeps dropping off. It is poorly designed and NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE. All my other equipment from Vodafone are excellent. I have been a customer for 15 years with a corporate account. They retailer would not replace with the new model until my contract ends in July 2023. Shabby,0
"Tried reporting fault for elderly neighbour after 2 new replacement poles put up. Tried to make appointment for engineer to call but couldn't. Was told agent would contact me, which he did, but after finding out I was a neighbour terminated the call. Have since tried further 8 times but no return call from 'agent'.",0
I ordered these as a Christmas present for my loved one. Ghd offered a garrenteed delivery before Christmas at an additional cost which was paid. Yet I still haven't received my item! To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. I thought going direct to the provider although not being as cheap as other places would assure that I would receive them without issue! No contact to sort this has been made even after emailing! Going to Dyson wouldn't have caused me this issue!,0
"Terrible service.
I ordered and it was offering a free gift.
My order turned up without the free gift.
I have emailed and not had any response in over a week.

The free gift was what made this a better option than the Cloud9 straighteners, but i now wish I'd have gone for the Cloud9.

Not great & i have been completely ripped off.",0
Sent my iPhone 11 to Mazuma in perfect condition. Kept in a case from the very beginning and well looked after. Not a scratch on it yet they have reduced my offer by ¬£55 due to apparently multiple scratches on the casing! I do not agree and won‚Äôt be using them again. I just knew that would happen before even reading the reviews. Very unhappy!,0
