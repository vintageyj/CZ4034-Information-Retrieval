Good place to start for people with no experience or no formal education. Stay 2 to 3 years max then move on.,"Benefits are average and pay is subpar compared to industry standards. The CEO, Rich Hume, is aloof and condescending. He speaks in lofty platitudes along with the rest of the Executive Management team. Executive Management is highly reactive, not proactive. They equivocate on every topic to the point of being pathologically deceitful. The SVP of Credit & Collections, Jay Snyder, is an uncouth rustic individual that runs his division like a medieval fiefdom. He manages and controls everything including the smallest details that should be delegated to lower management. It’s very strange to see an intolerant individual like this in an organization that prides itself in diversity and inclusion. Also, top sales producers are negatively impacted by TD Synnex changing its sales commission structure making it more difficult for sales to meet goals. Eddie Franklin, SVP Sales, had nothing to say about this cut in pay! Less pay for employees and more profits for the Executive team, Board of Directors, and shareholders."

Mostly PoS and small electronics repairs, plus some light I.T. work, particularly in Datacenters, Outstanding local and regional team eager to help you in any way! Lots of overnight work and travel which means more $$.","The company itself is laughably disorganized. The change their name and ""reset"" your employment status every few months. No one above your field manager can be contacted for any reason; and no one even knows HOW to reach them. It is a logistical nightmare, as much of your mundane tasks normally performed electronically have to be done by pen and paper, and mailed in (no exaggeration!) It takes them almost 2 years just to send you an employee badge; and by then it's no good because they'd already changed their name 3+ times! To add to the confusion, they are subcontracted by other organizations, so each WO assigned to you requires that you ""pretend"" that you are working for another company. This requires constant lying to their costumers, and it's basically unavoidable."

Many teams are understaffed and overworked, leaving little opportunities for employees to use PTO without detriment, and throwing teams into chaos when someone leaves the company because there was not sufficient cross-training or backup and documentation
With the merger, the executives continually boast about company performance and how it is good for everyone, but that is not being reflected in opportunities or with annual review/raises
