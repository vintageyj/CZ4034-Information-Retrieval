They tell potential customers they can support pretty much anything for Managed Services or Professional Services but then make no effort to get staff trained. Say anything to get the sale.

The base pay was excellent, and there is an opportunity for certifications and training. Unlimited PTO is only great during your employment, not when you leave or when you get laid off","This company has a great reputation for stability and no turnover rate but not anymore. It has been ranked as a great place to work and on the fortune 500, similar to other top decent organisations, but unfortunately, all those rankings are bogus and don't reflect that at all. A decent organisation that lay off its employees should be a great place to work, and fortune 500 of how they treat people when they let go. I have worked for similar organisations before and was laid off previously by other organisations. They have paid vacation pay, generous severance pay, and cash pay for cobra, and if you get a bonus, they will give you a suitable amount to reimburse for the bonus.
At Logicalis, I haven't got any of that, and the severance pay they offered was rubbish and stingy. Termination of unemployment is never a favourable decision to any employee, but decent organisations would not leave employees suffering. I have reached out to Management to revise severance but they don't care and they just replied with a standard rubbish email. The summary here is if you stay at Logicalis because they are stable, then that's not the case anymore, and if you are offered employment at Logicalis vs other organisation, then you better choose others. Also, If you have left Cisco/IBM because of their high turnover rate, then maybe go to them and leave Logicalis as they will take care of you when they terminate your employment"

The technical resources from both a support and pre/post sales perspective are some of the best I have ever seen.

The new leadership in place is just that, leadership, which may have been missing in some key areas in the past.

I'm not sure where that came from because the Service Desk currently has monthly 1on1 sessions, an agent led performance improvement team and monthly team lunches with agents and management.  There has also been over 15 people that have been promoted from the Service Desk to our Managed Services division in just the past year or so.  I'm happy with the opportunities and management team and work hard each day so I can earn my opportunities.

Although the company is trying to implement a career development strategy for its employees, I've seen all talk and very little action.  There is very little chance of advancement here, so you're best to move on after a few years.  Your personal career development is only as effective as the manager you work for.  If you work for someone who resists change, doesn't like to be challenged, and is a fan of doing things ""the way it's always been done"" (which is the current mindset of most mid-level managers here), then you are doomed to fail.

They talk a good game but It's all just smoke and mirrors.  Another review made a joke about cannibalism, but it's actually pretty sad to see how they devour people here.  I would bet that all of the positive reviews have been written by the HR staff.  They are overstaffed in that department and have plenty of time on their hands, let's face it.  My best advice is to run far away from this nightmare, if you have any self respect or pride.  I stuck it out for a very long time hoping that things would change for the better but they did not.  The executive team will back their management staff to the bitter end.  Bullying and harassment are common and also tolerated.  If you dare to make a mistake, however large/small or correctable, you will be raked over the coals for it but your manager will take zero accountability, they will even throw their own employees under the bus.

Logicalis values their employees as much as they value their customer base. Management constantly requests feedback from employees on improvement ideas and sees them through to fruition! Communication is solid between managers and employees and the open door policy is prevalent across the board in all departments.","A company that is growing at the pace that Logicalis is will always experience growing pains in regards to acquisition adjustments and personnel changes. While this occurs, the outcomes are no different than what you would experience at any other company that is growing. Change is inevitable and you simply have to move with it or get out of the way."

Logicalis,4.0,"May 28, 2019",Good but could be better,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Bloomfield Hills, MI","This is a very good place to start if you do not have any experience. If you have or are planing on getting your A+ certification, this is a really good place to get your experience because you will be handling issues that will allow you to use your A+  and grow your tech skills. That is not the case everywhere. The pay starts at $15 an hour. It's better than most helpdesk positions where the pay begins at $13.00 an hour. You do have to pay for your benefits. The health Insurance is pretty good. If you are looking to move up in the tech world, there is a Network Operating Center with Network Administrators, System Administrators and Server Administrators. The company likes to have a monthly birthday celebration where the provide cake and ice cream. There is also a sales meeting every three months where they give you free pizza. They really like to feed you here. There is also a free pop machine. They give put out free fruit every Tuesday. They also give away free Tiger tickets once a year even though the seats (and the team) aren't very good. The people are pretty friendly. If you are a tech, anime, video-game, PC nerd then you will fit in here. I'm not trying to be condescending when I type that. The Helpdesk Operations Manager is fair but he does hold everyone to a high standard. If you do your job and keep good attendance, you won't have to much to worry about.  This place is growing as well. They continue to get contracts and the team leaders will stand up for you if a customer gets rude. I've also seen quite a few people get promoted to technical and managerial roles. They have a award here call ""Rock Of The Service Desk"". If you win, you get to have dinner with the CEO, the buy you a prize and you get promoted. They monthly drawings for perfect attendance. If you win, you get an hour of free PTO or a parking pass to the underground garage. Its's not glamorous but it is there way of showing you they do notice you.","There are too many manager. There are about eight of them here. Luckily each manager has their projects that they look out for. However, I really think it could be more efficient if they had team leaders for each contract. 

The dental benefits are trash. They are cheap but not very good. You get one free cleaning per six months and the co-pays are expensive once the work gets gone. I got a root canal in March and that sucked up my entire insurance for the year. I did not know that dental insurance had a cap before I started here. 

They promote form within but once you get chosen it can take over a month to get to your position. I guess that there is this policy that promotions can only be done on the 1st of every month which causes the NOC to hire from the outside. It's just a faster process. 

The raises are not very good. I think it is something along the line of 38 cents after the first year. 

you get a lot of vacation time but you have to complete with everybody on the desk instead of just the people you work with on whatever contract you are on. Good luck with trying to get a day off on a Friday. 

You don't get holiday pay for all federal holidays.

No tuition reimbursement. 

The temperature control in this building is bad. Its always too hot or too cold. 

People have had their lunch stolen. Seriously

The managers don't do any evaluations so it is hard to get feedback on your performance. 

If you can, get a nightshift because there are no mangers around to hawk you. They sometimes like to micro-manage."

Logicalis,1.0,"Aug 5, 2014",Worst place on earth,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,The only reason to work here is because you have to collect some form of a paycheck so you can pay your bills.,The benefits have gone completely down hill. Bonus payouts have been taken away. Management treates employees like they mean nothing. Then management has the nerve to act shocked and offended when people leave.  HR pretends like everything is fine and dandy. Everyone is so fake.
Logicalis,2.0,"Jul 7, 2020",Expectations and job function changed drastically,Service Desk Technician,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Tempe, AZ",Some of the co-workers were decent to be around,"When I started working for Logicalis, I was explicitly told that we would be supporting one company and fully integrate with their systems. However, within a few months, they added 2 more companies to support fully (this means learning new protocols and proprietary software for each company). By the end of my employment with them, they were about to add a 4th company to the roster

The worst, however, was management's obsession with the appearance of working. I was fairly consistently in the top 5 reps (out of about 30 people) at the time, yet I could barely turn to talk to a coworker without management asking what I was up to. The last straw for me was when they required phones to be put away during your shift and started SCHEDULING bathroom breaks. That is simply disrespectful, especially for those who are doing a good job.

Being Bilingual made my (and my bilingual coworkers') life more difficult as well. I had an extra call queue to handle as well as taking any spanish ticket that came in.

Also, because they hired many unqualified (and frankly immature) reps, that meant that callouts were literally a DAILY issue. I got the ""..can you come in to cover for *** who called in sick?"" call at least twice a week. 

Tickets are not dispatched, but rather everyone is expected to grab tickets AND calls as they come in. This makes it to where a few top dogs end up carrying the load of picking up tickets to avoid the whole team getting yelled at. 
Management is the typical stick-up-the-ass type repeating corporate policies as if biblical truths. There are no real incentives to be a good employee here other than personal ethics.

All in all the micromanagement, co-workers not pulling their weight, and being treated like a prisoner who can't get up to pee made this job too much for me. The job itself was really not that bad."

Pay is commensurate of skills and well applied. Services and product are valuable. Very good marketing department.,"The company manament fails to display nusiness maturity. There is no consistency in product to market management. The intellectual property lives in the head of management. The suite of products could be better and better documented. Follow-through from management is not there. There is no vision just a focus on revenue and margin. As a result a lot of talented people have been laid off so that the business financial outlook be saved in the view of the parent company. They also make promises to prospective talent that they fail to keep. The top three people in the company are setting the culture and it is not developing to be a good one, which is a shame because the people under it have what it takes to make Logicalis one of the best emerging leaders in their market by the fact that they bring amazing credibility to the company."

Not all, but mine was a micro manager. Told me I need to start emailing her when I use the restroom? wtf. That was the last straw for me. Why is this stuff allowed by HR. That's another thing, HR is not there to regulate anything like this. Manager's can come up with whatever stupid rule they want for the department, even if unethical and it's all just ok. They play games. Manager's do not treat a top perfomer as a benefit to the department or company, I'm sure they're feeling regret about that right now! HR needs to step up and make rules and regulations company-wide. And train Manager's to know how to be a Manager so I don't have to do it. Here, if your manager thinks it's a good idea, then that's law and your manager can make up stupid rules and you basically have to follow them and like it or get lost. Go to a real company. Does Datatech even knew what goes on here? Things such as internal controls? Hello! Public Company! Where are they? So much passive agressive bs going on here all the time. The controller is educated and smart, but at the same time very dense. Get it together. Then they promote and make people manager that have ZERO people skills. Or you request pto time and get in trouble for it... or get told not to take any pto time for a while. Um, you can't give people pto days and then get mad when they use them and start a problem when there isn't one. There was this one manager that never even talked to her employee.... wow great idea.

Organizational maturity is low

Policies and procedures are inconsistent, utilized arbitrarily and when questioned become supplemented with additional process.  The sheer pain from knowing that your attempt to improve things will end up with additional procedural overhead prevents all by the most sadistic from striving for improvement.  Will a system designed by sadists will promote corporate excellence?

Current toolsets are out-of-date, out-of-touch, and instead of doing at least one thing well, does many things poorly.   Great emphasis is directed at presentations, demonstrations, etc.  But, zero thought is given to the tools, infrastructure, and delivery.   Would you buy your technology solution from a company when the sales rep is doing a BYOD demo on a Hello Kitty phone? 

Organizational methodology is weakly coupled and when combined with the communications issues, silos, and general culture creates an atmosphere where accomplishing anything easy is difficult and anything difficult impossible.  This is unfortunate because I remember a time when our delivery teams did the impossible with a panache that defined the brand."
Logicalis,3.0,"Nov 10, 2015",Logicalis Review,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,,"It was generally easy to take PTO when needed. When you work in the call center, there are a bunch of different clients, so the opportunity to learn a lot of different technologies exists.","For the call center, I would say pay was below average, especially since raises were a very rare thing. Overtime and weekends are often mandatory, and a holiday or two is usually thrown in as well (the call center operates 24x7x365). Not a lot of chances to move beyond the call center, if that is where you are starting. Benefits were also above the industry standard and coverage wasn't great."

Upper management is so desperate to make numbers, the amount of micromanagement and pressure that comes down from the top is unbelievable. The new president is a tyrant in every sense of the word. This company lacks direction. Every year we have a new charge to follow, a new strategy to adhere to. They change their minds so much, we don’t know our heads from our rear ends. Upper management has grand ideas and strategies for the future, however changes are made before the resources are in place to implement those changes. Very little thought to how these grand ideas affect the employees, the business and the customers.
The ground level is left to clean up the mess.  The pay stinks and they will “promote” you with extra work and title, but not compensate you.  When a manager tells
you to to change companies to make more money, that is telling. Oh, and the real great people in the company...they tend to fire and replace with inferior management. I once was happy but now struggle to find my peace among the chaos. Good people are dropping like flies and that is really telling. There are much better places to land."
