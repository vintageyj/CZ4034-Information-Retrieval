Training manager was the best thing about my experience,"This place is an absolute nightmare. The leadership is the worse I ever seen. First, you go through a one week only training with tons of info. Our training manager was great but she was the only trainer for the US and we only spent one week with her. As soon as you are done training they threaten you with firing you in three weeks if you don’t close a contract. The leads were poor and most businesses closed. In the short time I been here, so many reps, managers and head of sales quit back to back!! It’s a disaster"

In my impression, lots of of people (myself included at the time) working below their potential, for not great pay, for a company that always seemed to be on the verge of imploding. After a certain age, free coffee and the availability of a ping-pong table aren't going to cut it. At least for a lot of people.

The new management is absolutely deaf, Pulse surveys thinned out and then disappeared specially when Layoffs happened and chaos became the norm, at times it felt like the CTO wanted to thin the headcount by destroying every process we had, and making every work day a miserable experience. Most of the great people I knew that worked there were laid off or gone, lots of rumors that the goal is and always was to offshore all the technology team which is at odds with the supposed ""local destination"" message they wanted to convey. Whatever this company was 5 or even 2 years ago, it clearly isn't anymore. Pretty sad outlook overall. Compensation was average to below average"

Well lemme think.. oh wait it's NOTHING.,"What used to be pros of the company are now cons of it. Right from the moment venture capitalists stepped in; the company is going to dogs. It's disheartening to see the current state of groupon. Earlier the company used to be a haven for the employees but now it's more like a one way trip to hell. The management fires employees without a prior intimation or notice. It's feels as if they wake up in the morning and think as to whom or which team should I fire. Doesn't matter if u are the best performer or the best performing team; you will be fired. This is not an exaggeration. People are being fired like a sport. Dusan and his team must learn proper people management. For them cost optimization is firing employees. A personal suggestion from my side to people looking to join Groupon. Please DON'T. Management now is least interested in your growth, your performance or your existence for that matter. What used to be a great company is now in the rabbit's hole. Look for some other better companies. All that these people care is money and I am not even talking about profit that you generate. Despite you being the top performer you will be be fired. And yes don't even expect an explanation from their side coz they won't. Strongly will never recommend this hell of a place to anyone.

The people here are great.","Not the company they used to be 5-10 years ago- most business owners associate it with cheapness and low margins. Pay could be better- its not very hard to hit targets but commissions haven't picked up post covid. As a result they have been doing a lot of experimenting with the product to bring back revenues. They've been automating a lot as well and scaling back on cost- hopefully they don't reduce headcount which they've been hinting at for the last six months (again they are transparent about all this which I appreciate). As a result of all the changes and innovations some things get swept under rug because Account management is bogged down.
New CEO is good and not afraid to talk to us often but a lot of times he uses language that doesn't really answer questions (high level rhetorical answers that don't address our concerns)

I have various email exchanges with Senior Partners and even HR and the way they act toward certain people (or NOT act; ignore)). In 2023, it is very shocking to see such lack of DEI - although they advertise it all over their company profile page, I, and many others, know this company is far from diverse, or inclusive. Another con is the long-term viability of this company on just its actual product/service alone. I know very few people who use Groupon anymore. Times have changed. Groupon should've been sold to Google years ago for billions, but it can barely make the millions now. Even fudging the numbers like they did in the past (google it) can't save this company.

Groupon,2.0,"Feb 10, 2023",It was good while it lasted,Software Engineer,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Chicago, IL",My team was amazing. WLB was respected.,"The company never bounced back after COVID, and as a result of this the company has gone through several mass layoffs in the past year (and hiring contractors overseas). The manner in which positions were cut make very little sense to me. The manner in which employees were laid- off in January 2023 was not compassionate in the slightest - including terminating all health insurance policies within 1 week of termination and offering a very lacking severance package. Recent hires have never been spared from layoffs. New upper management would routinely disrupt the established engineering workflow with last minute and urgent asks. This quickly became the norm."

Be prepared to reprioritize based on the current needs of the business.

Groupon,1.0,"Jan 30, 2023",A sinking ship with the worst leadership I’ve ever endured,Director,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,Great coworkers (leadership aside) and remote work,"-Low pay -Horrible, disorganized leadership (One example: CEO Kedar Deshpande sent out a company-wide email on NYE to let us know that no one would be getting an annual bonus. The timing and content of this email was one of the most bizarre communications I’ve ever received from a leader. This is just one of many examples of awful leadership I’ve encountered at Groupon.) -The company is now being run by a PE firm out of Eastern Europe, and their only goal is to strip all the value out of the company before they sell out"
