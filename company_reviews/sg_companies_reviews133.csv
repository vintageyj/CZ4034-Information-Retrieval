Mphasis,1.0,"Feb 4, 2024",Working for Mphasis,Customer Support Representative,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Carrollton, TX",No Pros for this company,"Negative workplace, they understand and try to comply with the culture barriers, they have no integrity nor core values. No matter how much work you put in there is no appreciation, the clients are rude and they allow it. Upper management is very disconnected, they post the job as remote but as soon as you start you find out you will be working in an unsafe and unclean environment. Everything, I actually thought this job was a scam because I never applied. No core values, very unorganized, systems are outdated, the expectations they have are very unrealistic and instead of dealing with things they need to work on the employees are blamed for everything wrong even though we don’t have the resources needed to even do the job."

Although I still have meetings with mphasis management also and have to complete all the required training and stuff on that side also in addition to clients. I like the work. sometimes it can be alot of hours, but if you like what you do, then it doesn't matter that much.","Been here for 2 years now, and no pay increases or quarterly bonuses like I was told about in the interview. Also, no 401K match from the company. (which I was told during the interview that they were going to be changing that soon and offering a match)
There appears to be no timelines around reviews, increases, and bonuses. There is no communication either. I was told the other day in a meeting, that it could be another 4 quarters before they look at raises again. This would be a 3 year stagnant period without a raise in the highest inflation times in several decades. I know the company is still making money, just not as much as they want to make. However 433 million USD is not loosing money. This is the first company I have ever worked for in the last 40 years that I have not been given an annual raise of at least something. Some were not good if it was a bad year, but at least it was something."

But had too little personal agency and too little opportunity to level up. * I was led to believe I would challenging DevOps & AWS assignments, level up, and earn more. Instead I got 1.5 years more experience doing the same thing I've done before. * I would have been better off as a Giant Co employee automating my own job and / or climbing the corporate ladder.

I never saw an org chart and was not told who I reported to. I set up my 401k (which has no company match) to be 50% of my gross. They never came close to withholding 50% and it was never a consistent amount. They couldn't explain to me why or how they calculated the amount that was withheld. There had not been merit increases for the 7 years before I joined. There was a merit increase announced but since I had only been employed for 11 months and 3 weeks, instead of 12 months, I was ineligible. I found out over 2 years after I quit that they never updated my employment status with the 401k administrator so I cannot do a rollover. I contacted them with no response. I followed up and was told they would submit the update - not completed after 10 days. Again, I followed up to be told the request was made with offshore. Still waiting but will likely need to resort to taking legal action. Everything is run by the offshore parent company that has no understanding of how a company is run. I cannot recommend working for this company."

6. More focus is on adding new/unnecessary billable positions in the project than the required.
7. More Managers in a project than DEVELOPERS. Obviously for billing reason.
8. You cannot raise any concern in the company. There will be investigation on Anonymous surveys conducted by the third party company. They will ask every single employee about any bad feedback.
9. NO BENEFITS AT ALL. The only company that cut down employee benefits.
10. Looks like many of the reviews on Glassdoor are either paid or put by the HR team/ management to improve the company rating/image."

- They hire you and sorta modify you resume which helps you get in. It sounds immoral, but when companies reject you for ""junior/entry level roles"" that are barred by 5 years of experience, you gotta game the system somehow

- They'll almost always find a job. I went through a training program for their 1st job and I got paid even when on the bench. If there's an issue HR/IT support is very responsive so that's nice ( be warned, for some reason their forgot password can't recognize non- Indian numbers, which is a pain)","There is literally 0 upward mobility. After a year of working with them and satisfactory response from the client, their total raise was capped at 5%, which doesn't even help beat inflation standards. 

In addition, they have an absurd list of monthly pop quizzes/random crap to do. And believe it or not, its not TCS levels of ""Can you cosplay a human dictionary and cram all these terms"" but its still a pain. I'll never understand why companies think employees have to spend literal days doing their pop quizzes on HR things

Like EVERY service based company, you'll ALWAYS make less through them than directly working with a company. And its just common sense since these companies need a way to survive"
