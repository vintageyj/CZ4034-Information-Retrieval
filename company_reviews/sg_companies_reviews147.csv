Carousell,2.0,"Jan 24, 2024",11 year old start up under extreme pressure to become profitable,Product Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Singapore,"Hybrid work setup
Management considers the feedback from employees
People are generally nice and friendly","Unrealistic targets are cascaded top down with limited resources like headcount, product support, and budget which sets up the entire organization for failure. 

Senior leadership has lost the confidence of the employees with yearly company targets being missed. 

Middle management and their teams are under extreme pressure and held responsible for unrealistic targets. While Senior leadership lacks accountability.
 
Monthly town halls are plagued with Q&A's about possible layoffs, company outlook, and slow product innovation.

Internal employee engagement survey concerns revolve around growth opportunities, senior management credibility, slow product improvements, salary, and compensation competitiveness.

Can observe a change in culture with the pressure to become profitable. It's becoming less people-oriented compared to when it started. Glassdoor reviews were previously 90% plus."
Carousell,1.0,"Feb 23, 2024","Low confidence, high turn over, overworked, poor compensation",Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"- Hybrid working model but tightening on work from office 
- Friendly and helpful colleagues 
- No dress code","The company's initial emphasis on a people-first culture and a strong mission orientation underwent a significant shift due to the intense pressure to achieve profitability, resulting in employees feeling reduced to mere numbers. The layoffs in 2022 left existing staff burdened with increased responsibilities, particularly impacting those tirelessly working on the ground, while management remained seemingly unaffected.

A lack of cohesion among numerous managers has led to inconsistent strategies and a palpable absence of clear direction. Frequent restructuring and a tendency to change strategies without warning create an environment where execution becomes challenging. Townhall meetings have become dominated by concerns about potential layoffs and inadequate compensations, but management became annoyed and chose to discontinue addressing these questions, further eroding employee confidence.

The organization faces a continuous exodus of talent, with monthly resignations reflecting an inability to competitively retain skilled professionals. There's a significant disconnect between management and ground-level operations, they are not even aware of our KPIs. Middle management contributes to a toxic work environment by fostering office drama, often rewarding those adept at playing internal politics rather than delivering value-added work to drive profitability goals.

Product innovation is painfully slow, and user-oriented teams, like the seller experience team, lack effective communication with platform sellers. The recent launch of integrated delivery is celebrated as groundbreaking, yet it raises concerns about the company's ability to catch up with competitors after 12 years in the industry. Recent product launches were clearly designed to squeeze their sellers dry to forcefully drive up revenue. 

Overall, there is an extreme lack of confidence in the company's ability to achieve profitability. While a focused, action-oriented approach may improve the situation, ongoing brain drain is further diminishing the chances of success. Good luck achieving profitability and cashing out."

Carousell,4.0,"Nov 29, 2023",Wonderful people but poor directional guidelines and developmental mentoring,Associate Manager,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"I love how the senior management is as transparent as they can be about the Company's status and performance. 
People are very welcoming, and the management team are very approachable regardless of a person's job level.

Nice flexible benefits as well as yearly reimbursable wellness allowance for both full-time and agency employees. It's the employee's choice on whether they will use this allowance for their work from home setup or gym or other hobbies.","The high level direction is clear, however the lower level strategies on how to get there is like looking at muddy water. You could be focusing on a certain KPI for half the year only to be informed that there will be changes and you need to work on something else, which is understandable. however, it would be good to at least get ground level opinion as well on how feasible a certain idea is.

Unclear professional growth/development plans, your effort may be less due to a well planned task list or your personal efficiency but you won't be as noticeable as personnel working overtime, which slowly transitions Carousell into a more traditional type of corporation contrary to their revolutionized google-style beginning.
Without a clear career path, people tend to look elsewhere for growth.

Slow tech development/improvement. Sales and marketing related app/tech drive will have less impact if customers can't have their basic needs such as a decent search function or fraud prevention features or even a more precise filter functionality.

This is just a personal opinion, but Carousell needs more visibility in Markets it caters to and craft appropriate marketing strategies that is actually applicable to the market. The marketing team, at least in the Philippines, tends to go towards a more upscale approach in terms of endorsers, but the second hand market isn't predominantly made of people who can buy things that are brand new."

Truthfully, the company was INCREDIBLE for any hungry sales associate when I first joined, they allowed us to acquire merchants from broad categories while recognising renewal sales from merchants we close, everyday I was excited to wake up looking forward to work ( how many can really say that in their job) to build carousell whilst helping merchants build their business growth with carousell and of course growing my paycheque! It was a dream job! With this system it was almost like i was running my own business and i look forward to close new merchants and renewing them showing them growth on their business. I wanted to stay here till retirement.","Just too much went wrong so instead of typing them all out, i advise job seekers must be Extremely adaptable and okay with unfair KPI distribution and non thoroughly thought out major implementations… otherwise take a chance and cross your fingers for the higher end treatment due to negligence in target allocation and expectation.

Tech wise, they use GCP instead of AWS (like i said there’s no AWS :p) so it might take sometime to get used to for the folks in the AWS camp. 

There’s a lot of deprecated and poorly documented/hard to understand code because there’s no hard requirements on code standards. It makes people whom these code are handed over to miserable because they’re afraid to break things if they refactor. In general, very little best practices can been seen here, eg people commit large PRs expecting colleagues to review instead of doing a stacked PR, no formatting checks in auto test etc. It’s hard to push for a change in tech culture because the seniors are resistant.

There are competitors everywhere and it won't be long before they are under extreme pressure. Growth has slowed down and the product has suffered.

Innovation has suffered as a result and you can see that in the product. Very slow vs. other tech companies.

Carousell,2.0,"Oct 10, 2021",Please consider these points before joining,People Team,Former Employee,,"1. Most of the employees here came from worse working environments e.g. Media agencies, toxic local SMEs, Honestbee and hence believe that this grass is a lot greener. If you’ve been through terrible work environments, yes carousell will be (slightly) better. Is it the best place to work in Singapore? Definitely not. 

2. There is autonomy to make decisions that have immediate outcomes and visibility, and on some occasions the founders will be verbally grateful to you for them.

3. Most people on the ground here are really trying their best to do what they love and work hard. And yes, if you are looking to join the marketplace experience team, or the tech team - you are most likely to enjoy your experience there. Carousell understands that tech is competitive and will do their best to treat tech hires right, not so much for the other departments. 

4. In some departments, there’s a good culture of fun and team bonding. Carousell is intentional about spending time together and bonding, and there will be budget for this too.","1. The Carousell group acquired 4 companies over the years - OLX (Philippines), Mudah (Malaysia), Chotot (Vietnam) and OneKyat (Myanmar). There is a lot of mess and neglect in this process and the founders are struggling to understand how to manage them, most people here complain of being overworked, underpaid and under-supported way more than their Carousell counterparts.

2. Management - the Glassdoor reviews that you read here are true. Even though most of management came from affluent and long standing histories of experience, most of them just want to oppress their reports. They know nothing and want to be treated like royalty - you will be asked to book meeting rooms for them, teach them how to record on zoom/order food on foodpanda, buy things for them and much more. (To be fair, most of the things experienced are in the People team - high turnover rate a clue?) You will be shocked at how they can say words with no accountability and tact, despite their “experience”. The founders are much younger than most and clearly struggle to manage them - all these incidents mentioned were bought up to the founders and no action taken, resulting in employees resigning because they gave up hope. 

3. As much as they seem to look corporate and SME-like, most people here will admit that it’s still very much like a start up. Little to no processes, constant change in systems and poor communication downstream. 

4. There is a deep systemic resentment towards salary. The context is as a startup, most employees who have been there for years received start up pay. Only up till a year ago, the management decided to pay competitively to new hires and that’s when the bitterness and comparison arose. Imagine only getting half or less of the salary of your counterpart and doing the exact same work - as much as this is common, Carousell is not an MNC and it doesn’t come with any MNC benefits. 

5. Burnout culture: is real here. As much as the people experience team tries to sell “work life balance” and “Wellness Wednesdays”, they don’t actually live it out themselves. You will see the team reply to slack or send emails at 12am-1am, people are angry and uncooperative and being told they lack resilience when they are being pushed to breaking point at work. There is deep mistrust for managers as most of them are deemed inexperienced or incompetent. The people team try to mitigate but everyone can tell that they are struggling with their own manager, too. When asked, most of them are on the lookout for better opportunities and said that they will leave in a heartbeat if the opportunity presents itself."

Carousell,1.0,"Jan 15, 2022",Manager have no clue on how to run a company.,Sales Manager,Former Employee,,No dress code and nice office,"Culture: Management like to talk about how important they put people first. FYI the ‘people’ is the founders, management and ppl they like. Founders  like to appear and talk during townhall, but when it comes to execution it is zero.

Hiring the wrong people to do the wrong thing. 
- Do note that a lot of ppl they hire are ahbeng and ahlian that cant even speak properly. Most management are uncle aunty that have load of experience but have no clue how the tech and marketplace works. 

Company still not profitable.
- Imagine in the market for 10y and still losing money, this tells you how bad the company is doing. A lot of the verticals are still losing money until today. Since management are bunch or uncle and aunty, their idea of making money is to increase price of their subscription and ads for those verticals that are doing well.

Toxic Culture
- lots of politics in the company always regarding who the management likes and dislikes. For a company that is not profitable to have too many managers within a department. A lot of the associates they hire are ex-colleagues of the manages, and managers will prioritise these colleagues in terms of job assignment and promotion. 

Incompetent staff
- a lot of their managers are too incompetent. Asked their project manager a question and took him 2 weeks to answer me. He will organise a Q&A session with us, but its all questions since he cant answer us and can only note down those questions we asked and nvr answer us.

Founder is not taking this seriously.
They will come in office and chitchat with everyone like they are close friends. Talk like Steve Jobs during meeting and town halls but no have idea on execution and neither do they care."

Carousell,1.0,"Nov 2, 2021",Not a great place to work,Human Resources,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Singapore,They have flexible hours to work and inter-team mobility is available after a while. Talented teammates.,"- Culture: They talk pretty highly of their core values, but once it trickles down to following them, it's no where close. 

- Management: What they say is always right and they favor their own references and ex-colleagues when it comes down ""trust"". Personally, they don't treat HR folks as a business too so, HR opinion is the last opinion or better still ""no opinion required"" category. Highly bureaucratic/ political and very traditional in their approach and highly judgemental as leaders. 

- Attrition: a pretty high double figure attrition and a lot of people have left in HR /Tech/ product teams, clearly because they felt less heard or the leaders didn't work too hard to retain talent. Try avoiding 

- Interview process: is long, very long, very very long. They want to compete with FAANG company process but pay you peanuts in salary. They are always depending over budgets.

People team and TA team have maximum attrition this year, they say ""i hear you"" and ask you to move on. very insensitive even though they pretend to sound concerned and neglect you after sharing concerns.

Overall as an organisation, the co-founders pop up during townhalls to talk about company performance but very less invested in people and they go quiet on decisions for people. They may hear you out but they don't care to action out probably max assign your managers to deal with your issues. In that matter, none of the management really cares to hear about your concerns, it's too fake to be honest. So unless, you are a reference or you know some leaders well - you are bound to grow slowly in this space, highly biased in decisions and very likely to hear you out but not provide any solution or leave it to the managers to take biased decisions.

P.s. Carousell is more responsive on glassdoor than actually solving problems internally."
