Tata Communications,1.0,"Dec 5, 2023",Worst Experience EVER,Senior Manager - Sales,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,Teammates are great and pay is decent.,"Disconnected management. They don't respect nor listen to front line sales people. Extremely unreasonable expectations. Micro managed. Even though they have salesforce, they still use spreadsheets for reporting in addition to a multitude of tracking and trivial projects that you have no time to sell. Difficult to get anything accomplished since your India sased support team isn't responsive enough. You will need to repeatedly chase answers. I would not recommend this company. Nobody seems happy and everybody is overworked and stressed. This will continue as they have plans to go from $400M to $1B in USA with the strategy to pound your sales team to work harder & harder yet not providing any additional resources to help achieve those goals. Sales quotas doubled in 1 year yet whom you can sell to and where you can sell remained the same."

It doesn't work for employees located far away time zones like western US thereby impacting work/life balance.  And, every month has extreme pressure to meet numbers like the end of a fiscal year, although sales cycle can take months or years to close deals - a huge mismatch between management goals (run by consultants) and reality on the street.

They are not shy about promoting employees in India and laying off American employees for cost-saving reasons. 

I started a year ago, and in that year, all of the American employees I knew have been laid off. My entire Business Unit was laid off without my knowledge - I found out a week later that I was going to be passed to a completely different team and my team no longer exists. I understand that lay-offs happen, but as a general courtesy I should have been informed. But, as it is working for Tata in the US, we are an after-thought. 

I was excited to work for a global company but this is not a global company and you will not be supported administratively or career-wise if you work in the US."
Tata Communications,3.0,"Nov 14, 2017",Good place to get your feet wet with an international org,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",,Positive Culture in North America. Great camaraderie. Good options to move around company. CLevel accessible to employees. Quarterly visits from Clevel team.  Good international opportunities and foot holds in ASIA PAC and EMEA regions.,Not a lot of assets in North America. Products lacking. New cloud products are 5-10 years behind schedule and that of competitors. Emphasis on cloud products but these are overshadowed by legacy telecom products. Telecom bureaucracy makes it hard for the company to act nimble. Hard for startup and mid small to mid level enterprises to do business with slow response time of product and commercial teams.

Although they prefer you reliably come to the office, you usually have a lot of flexibility to work from home. Co-workers are not usually ""lazy""","India bureaucracy can be slow and frustrating. India staff not doing their job. Telecom company, not ""dot-com""
Purchasing anything or getting legal sign off is very time consuming. We are required to use India staff heavily (it IS an Indian company after all), but they are not very good or savvy.
Senior management is mediocre, except for Vinod."

Nice people to work with. Senior management makes a good effort to engage employees to provide feedback. Flexibility with respect to working hours and coming into office.,"Working hours can be tough if you work in India based projects; also it is often required to work long hours and on weekends at critical stages of projects. A bit too much emphasis on short-term achievements (e.g. getting product pushed out as soon as possible), rather than making sure foundation is properly in place. Processes often not well defined which makes it difficult to improve them."

Tata Communications,4.0,"Sep 30, 2008",Flexible environment despite some global uncertainties,Account Manager,Current Employee,"Reston, VA",My boss is flexible and allows teleworking as long as the job is getting done.  The office is business casual and people work flexible shifts as well.,"Uncertainty in the future of the telecommunications markets are always something to deal with.  Senior leadership recognizes the challenges in general.  Jobs have left North America for India and more could potentially be transferred.  Some of the India based team is very good and others are near ""rookie"" status that one might expect working with educated, but unfamiliar to business people."
Tata Communications,2.0,"Aug 5, 2013","Horrible upper management; no insight, no communication and sadly it seems personal agendas abound.",,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"If you can stomach bureaucratic nonsense, it's a good springboard.","There are a lot of internal politics for trivial issues.

Unrealistic customer requests sometime drive direction and more often than not, de-rail critical projects in the form of an engineering scramble to implement a feature only to have it stall before deployment."
Tata Communications,2.0,"May 25, 2012","Great CEO, mediocre pay, zero process",Director,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Herndon, VA","Tata Communications has some great strengths - 

1. The CEO, Vinod Kumar is a great leader and someone who instills confidence. The company is still loss making (in May 2012) and had just turned EBITDA positive, but the employees are overall hopeful under his leadership that the company will turn the corner before the shareholders lose patience.

2. The Tata group culture is evident with its high standard of ethics and values, though this is clearly stronger in India than in other countries.

3. The company has a great asset base - its cable infrastructure, its infrastructure base in India, its reputation within the service provider community

4. It has some great people, who are largely non-political and whom you feel good about working with.","The company is struggling with some significant downside risks:

1. The level below the CEO - the top 30 managers of the company (called the G30) are a diverse bunch of people with varying levels of competence, politics and values. There are some solid people who deliver upon what the company was known for and there are some newcomers hired in the last 2 years who have brought in a culture of cutting corners and expediency. This layer is very political, with lots of infighting and good skill in positioning themselves, rather than doing good work. 

2. The lack of process is plain to see for anyone. Where there is some process, it seems to have been put in by some evil bumbling bureaucrat - so onerous and misguided, that people mostly look for ways to avoid it. In recent years several senior people have been hired to bring in process rigour, but the lack of process has prevailed - and it seems to be a graveyard for those senior 'business excellence' executives.

3. The salaries are mediocre and pay scales are pegged to the 50th percentile. This may work in India, where the Tata brand is strong and people buy into that as a compensation to lower salaries, but internationally it means that Tata Communications attracts some rather mediocre talent who cling onto the company for dear life"
Tata Communications,3.0,"Mar 13, 2018",Attorney,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,"Washington, DC","Benefits, 4 weeks annual vacation,",Starting base  salaries are low.

Open plan office if you are into that sort of thing. Interview process is relatively easy, onboarding is quick.","No training is provided whatsoever, so be prepared to be tossed under the bus by the manager you never see when something goes wrong. A real corporate snakepit: I've never met so many backstabbers, bullies, and weasels in my career. Coworkers, especially managers, never have anything nice to say about employees who have left the company.  They are also pretty quick to cut each other up when they think someone is out of earshot.

Tata Communications,1.0,"Jun 22, 2015",Ghost Ship,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Burlingame, CA","One of the pros of working here is that you will learn a keen sense of what it is to run a technology division of a Tier 1 communications company, using the absolutely bare minimum of resources. I've often heard about how painfully under resourced the Russian space program used to be, but I'm rather certain that if we brought a Russian tech worker to this company, they would say things might be bad in Russia, but not this bad :)

Bottom line is this - where the main corporation may or may not be totally healthy (and I have no idea on the status of this) - my position was part of the organization which at this point is kind of like a ghost ship. Nearly all experts have left the company over the past few years, and they're not being replaced by new ones.

Where the lack of leadership is obviously a bad thing, for my case it did bring with it a bunch of flexibility in terms of vacation days, working from home, etc and I was definitely appreciative of that :)","Salaries are 20-30% under market average, in some cases it's even less than that.
