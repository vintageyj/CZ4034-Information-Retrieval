The pressure is all on you to figure out how to hit those targets and execute without documentation, but you only get pointed out for when you missed out something, not when you keep everything smoothly. They will say it's because of the ""hard-core"" culture — sounds like a great word to force everyone to work to their bone eh?


Manager pulls you into meetings 1 minute before that are not scheduled in the calendar and meetings are scheduled without respect for your PTO/bank holidays. You will find hardly any need to foster any relationship with coworkers, because why would you when they leave within a couple of months.

They have also paid off people in certain markets to make their criminal issues go away. They have built inferior internal tools to replace Microsoft Office and Google Suites in order to avoid easy access for US authorities to their information. They suffer from massive hubris, believing they have reinvented the corporation in just 5 years. they refuse to do a forecast for example - something that would have allowed them to spot early on that they were over-hiring, rather than then letting go of 1,500 people they had pulled out of good jobs but could not afford CZ recites his latest management book readings as though they are gospel, but has no idea how to actually manage people, and he and his co-founders maintain a tight inner circle that controls all decisions - even those they are spectacularly unqualified to make. The culture is toxic, most conversations are extremely transactional - everyone works remote, no one switches on their cameras, some people use aliases, and no one bothers with relationship building. Why would you? The turnover is astonishingly high - people leave without any announcement being made and suddenly you have to find someone else to turn to for information. Again, because they are so dodgy, they don’t have proper org charts which makes it a nightmare internally trying to find someone to help you with your work Avoid, avoid, avoid…."

* Good benefits - decent budget for home office, flexible hybrid approach.
* Peers are generally very responsive, supportive, knowledgable in the field and are idea-driven;
* Many 'in-development' processes which can be a good ramp for visibility if you are proactive.","* High tempo and potential micromanagement (rigorous work time monitoring, breaks/lunch logging, explaining missed minutes, etc.);
* Some KPIs are inflated beyond any logic, the company treats AML sector strictly in 'quantity over quality' manner which directly translates how the specialists are treated too. Quality assurance is practically non-existent;
* Terrible horizontal and vertical career paths and roadmapping, or lack thereof. Supervisors are clueless about any growth prospects and tend to shake off responsibility of assisting their staff in developing in any direction. Internal interview processes are very chaotic, managers won't always be familiar with actual job ad details, can be late to their own interviews (or do not show up at all). Also, internal hiring managers tend to play politics behind applicants' backs, discriminate based on specific team/jurisdiction, and avoid feedback or contact post-interview; 
* Zero knowledge and expertise development support. Managers will not provide you with any certificate or courses prospects, neither will HR - actually, they might suggest you to ""ask your colleagues to forfeit the team-building budget for your certificate"";
* Some AML functions demand staff to work during inconvenient shifts, late hours, weekends;
* The company seriously struggles with its employee rating and performance review system which gets re-done every quarter when CZ gets obsessed over a new radical system."
Binance,1.0,"Jul 27, 2023","Unreasonable expectations, lack of transparency, frequent firing",Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",,Binance is a well-known crypto company,"Terrible hours, expect to work 24/7 - Most of the leadership is based in the Middle East or APAC. If you live outside of those time zones, you will be regularly expected to attend calls before 7am and after 10pm North America time. Highly centralized and political - All decisions roll up to the leadership team. Even small decisions need to be looked at by CZ. Decisions take forever and the leadership team is always the gatekeeper of approvals, yet they expect you to reach absurdly high KPIs. Unreasonable expectations - They expect you to regularly work until 3am and attend meetings at ~6am, and set KPIs that are 2-5 times more than what a normal company would set. They motivate employees through fear of getting fired since no one can hit these KPIs. Chinese-centric - If you do not speak business Chinese, you will not make it far in this company. Most of the leadership is Chinese native, and not English native. If you cannot present your ideas in Chinese, it may fall on deaf ears. There is a ""PMO"" or bilingual secretary (usually a senior IC-level junior person) assigned to each member of leadership. These PMOs are constantly trying to gatekeep and elevate themselves, even if it means throwing team members under the bus. Lack of integrity - during the mass 2023 US employee layoff, there were cases of actively reducing severance packages initially promised."

Very low display of accountability at the organizational level.

Binance,1.0,"Mar 30, 2023","Bye, Nance.",Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,Decent pay and benefits. Full remote working.,"Where to begin? Incompetent and entitled leadership team - it gets worse the further up the ladder you go. Many of the decision makers (or indecision makers?) are either literally old friends of the CEO or mediocre hangers on who have nodded their up the food chain. 24/7, unrelenting chasing and bickering on the internal comms platform (usually as a side effect to comically inefficient processes with little quality work actually being done) - a complete disregard for the human beings on the other end. A backstabbing and blame culture that I’ve never seen anything close to before. I’ve witnessed someone fabricate a situation in order get one of their team members fired - and it worked (my concerns over this were then laughed off and ignored by HR). Completely opaque organisation - for a company claiming to be focused on the ‘freedom of money’ they sure do have a lot to hide, even from their own employees. Mainland China style work culture (though saying that is probably unfair to other Chinese companies) 9-9-6 would be an improvement for the work life balance of many at Binance. A company that claims to be a flat and dynamic organisation but is deeply hierarchical - good luck challenging or questioning any of the aforementioned ‘leaders’ - these are Binancian royalty who need not take advice from us plebeians. Middle managers who dare attempt to do so get put through the shredder immediately. ."

Binance,1.0,"Jun 5, 2023",Questionable Practices,Senior Project Manager,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,Remote working and a great pay package are a dream when the market is doing well...or so you think...,"The expectation is that you work almost 24/7 and they're tracking your use of the laptop. You will be punished for being efficient at your job and the so-called freedom is only a perception as finishing your work efficiently makes management think you are skiving. When e-learning is not completed. HR threatens to withhold your pay. Having a high compensation from the company is the very reason you may lose your job when management suddenly decides to cut costs. HR and management also intend to find several excuses to try and fire individuals without severance and insidiously get your managers to schedule one-on-one calls but will unpleasantly bait-and-switch you with HR in a call to let you know you have been made redundant. Despite what the CEO says about letting people go on twitter, the truth is far from it. The company likes to operate in ambiguity and has questionable practices. Management makes decisions on whims and not based on logic and there are many single points of failure with no business resiliency. It's a sinking ship. Best beware."
Binance,4.0,"Jun 3, 2023",good company but need to clean up a bit,Customer Service Representative,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"Payment is good, people are friendly and managers are taking junior feedbacks seriously, there is no ego from management and the company really takes human rights seriously.","the company is paying attention on bottom out, but meanwhile wasting many talents without knowledge. I have heard of many bully managers, who did not like the employee and prevented them to do more good. I cannot say I am %100 in the same situation but I had similar situation where my supervisor never appreciated the hard work I have done (verbally yes but I have never saw it on performance rating). I will refer this person as 'them' Them, underestimated my work during the meets in front of my other colleagues, has given me really bad feedback which does not rely on any fact. The company take feedback system into seriously but I do not believe in anonymity so unfortunately to keep my job I stayed silent."
