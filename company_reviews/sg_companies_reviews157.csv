DocuSign,5.0,"Dec 7, 2023","Striving for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion!!",Principal Recruiter,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Chicago, IL","I've had the privilege of being a part of DocuSign for over 4 years, and I can confidently say that it's an outstanding workplace that truly stands out in the corporate world. DocuSign's commitment to fostering a phenomenal company culture is evident in every aspect of its operations.

The company emphasizes openness and transparency at every level, creating an environment where employees feel valued and empowered. From top leadership down to individual teams, there's an evident dedication to listening, understanding, and incorporating diverse perspectives. This open communication culture encourages collaboration and innovation, fostering an atmosphere where everyone's ideas are heard and respected.

What sets DocuSign apart is its unwavering drive for success. The company not only sets ambitious goals but also provides the necessary support and resources for employees to achieve them. There's a palpable sense of motivation and enthusiasm that permeates throughout the organization. This drive is contagious and inspires employees to push boundaries, take initiative, and strive for excellence in their work.

Moreover, the leadership at DocuSign is commendable. They lead by example, embodying the company's values and vision. Their commitment to transparency and accessibility further amplifies the culture of openness within the organization. They encourage feedback, embrace change, and actively support the professional growth and development of their employees.

In addition to the fantastic culture, DocuSign's dedication to diversity, equity, and inclusion deserves applause. The company's initiatives to create a more diverse workforce and an inclusive environment are evident and appreciated.

Overall, DocuSign is not just a workplace; it's a community that thrives on collaboration, openness, and the pursuit of success. Working here has been an enriching experience, and I'm continually impressed by the company's commitment to its employees and its values.","DocuSign undoubtedly stands out as a leading company in the industry, known for its innovative solutions and exceptional culture. However, as with any rapidly growing organization, there are certain aspects related to company growth that merit consideration.
One area where DocuSign's rapid growth can sometimes present challenges is in maintaining seamless internal communication and coordination. As the company expands and diversifies its offerings, there may be instances where different departments or teams face difficulties in aligning their goals and strategies. This rapid scaling can sometimes lead to complexities in interdepartmental communication, potentially impacting the overall efficiency and cohesion within the organization.

Additionally, while growth is a sign of success, it can occasionally create a sense of unpredictability or instability among employees. The swift expansion and evolving strategies might lead to changes in roles, structures, or processes that could affect employee morale or job stability, particularly if these changes are not communicated effectively or if there's a lack of clarity regarding the company's long-term vision.
It's important to note that while these challenges exist, DocuSign's leadership and management teams are proactive in addressing these concerns. They acknowledge the hurdles associated with rapid growth and are consistently working towards enhancing internal processes, fostering better communication channels, and ensuring that employees are equipped to adapt to changes effectively."

Ok on compensation (not good not great)
Flexible working","Somehow DocuSign still has not figured out how to collect the money it is owed from its customers. It allows for customers to access the platform without ever having paid for their plan. Then when they don't pay, they will be sent to collections after a year. Oh yeah! Then when they go to collections, that money that DocuSign is missing from the customer, they will come back to the account executive who originally sold the deal, and take it from their compensation on future deals."
DocuSign,1.0,"Jan 20, 2024",How the might have fallen,Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Seattle, WA","Had some of the best people, moments, memories, and work of my life. Used to be literally the best place to work and ranked 5th in the world. Helped propel my career and thought I was going to be a DocuSign lifer.","Turnover is crazy. Culture has changed. All budgets are cut. No stipends anymore. No holiday parties. 2 days required in office. New manager is insanely arrogant and micromanages. 

Manager tanked a large deal and client said he was horrible to work with and when I tired to save the deal they said they were 100% sure they were going with Docusign but the manager made it sound like they were the bad guy because they looked at other competition as their decision making process. They followed up a response to me that with they wished they worked with me in the whole process, but again, my manager went over my head and took over the deal and tanked it. I was #2 on my team and was put on a PIP that was cut short because it was his word vs mine, and ultimately cut. In the same timeframe 5 other colleagues in my org who have been there for years jumped ship. News to broke out a week later that a private equity firm is about to buy out Docusign. 

This is a sinking ship. What used to be. They’ve lost all their personality and everything that made them special. People don’t come first anymore."
DocuSign,1.0,"Mar 7, 2024",Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!,Engineering,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","Seattle, WA",Compensation is decent. We used to have some of the best coworkers in tech so some of us were able to really experience creative minds and be a part of some really cool products before our company was taken over,"Leadership is run by boomer board members that actually used a bible verse in an all hands meeting a few years go. People that had been here over a decade were laid off while on paternity leave. About 3 or 4 years ago, we started seeing knowledgeable people get let go to be replaced by offshore or friends of leadership that will never disagree or insist on doing the right thing. Highly concerning judgment in respects to honesty all around."
DocuSign,4.0,"Feb 20, 2022",The golden days are over,Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","San Francisco, CA","DocuSign is a great company. They treat their employees well, offer great benefits, stock options, mental health days, and are undoubtably the best product in the market.","Now is not the time to work in sales. Quotas are rising, territories are getting split in two year, seemingly year over year, and attainment is at an all-time low. DocuSign performed extremely well in the pandemic. However, continuing that growth at that rate was not realistic. Stock options are worth 40% of what they were due to management's inability to forecast our numbers.

The commercial org is really strugglingly across the board. OTEs are already incredibly low for market standards - and no one is hitting quota. 1/26 reps in the commercial FinServ org hit quota in Q4 (across all segments). People are unhappy and are really starting to look elsewhere. I worked at DocuSign for two years. Year one, virtually no turnover. In the past 6 months, there has been a ton (and many more are on the way out.)

There is no training program for sales. If this is your first sales job, it's sink or swim.

Our CEO told the company all-hands everyone would be getting raises. In the next call, our CRO specified - ""everyone but sales"". This really set the sales team off. The MDRS got raises, but the AEs and sales managers did not.

A relatively high performing MDR is out earning a commerical AE. Because of this, many MDRs don't even want to get promoted to AE - it's virtually a pay-cut if you're not an allstar AE."

DocuSign,3.0,"Feb 6, 2024",Great Place to work....for a few months,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Former Employee, less than 1 year",,"Honestly, the culture in the sales org is incredible. Loved working with all my coworkers. Your coworkers and manager make you want to work harder. It's such a fun place to be at.","""...it's such a fun place to be at."" for a few months. The turnover rate is ridiculous and disheartening to know that hard work doesn't mean you get to keep your job. Even when you are hitting your numbers, meeting quota, and showing up every day; in the end that won't matter at all. I bust my BUTT every day and it just does not matter to anyone outside of my internal team. I hate this.

So my question is...what does it take to stay at a company if meeting/exceeding the requirements doesn't secure your position? We hire one new leader and she destroys a department. This is a business so I get it but when are leaders going to start taking accountability for loss?"
DocuSign,2.0,"Feb 10, 2024",From Innovation to Desperation: The Decline of a Once Beloved Company...,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",,"This was once a place where creativity and dedication were nurtured, where employees felt valued and part of something greater than themselves.","The appointment of a rookie CEO marked the beginning of a tumultuous era, characterized by a series of misguided decisions that seemed more akin to a high-stakes gamble than strategic leadership. Within the span of 18 months, the company has had three layoffs, each a direct consequence of ill-conceived strategies that failed to address the core issues at hand. The promise of a leaner, more agile organization has instead left DocuSign threadbare and struggling to maintain the quality and innovation that once defined it.

Equally disheartening is the role of its Board of Directors, whose detachment from the company's operations and culture is palpable. Their decisions, often made in the echo chamber of the boardroom, reflect a startling lack of understanding of our industry and the people who dedicate their lives to it. Their actions, or at times inaction, have not only jeopardized DocuSign’s financial stability but have also eroded the trust and morale of those who remain.

The current senior leadership seems hellbent on undermining the very foundation of the company's image and goodwill. The external narrative being crafted is one of success and forward momentum, a stark contrast to the internal reality of uncertainty and discontent. The disconnect between the public facade and the private turmoil has only served to alienate long-standing partners and customers, who once relied on DocuSign’s integrity and transparency.

The executive decisions of late, rather than being uplifting and uniting, have only served to further demoralize an already beleaguered workforce. Initiatives that once would have sparked innovation and collaboration now fall flat, as the overarching sentiment is one of survival rather than growth. The relentless drive for cost-cutting and efficiency, while necessary in moderation, has been pursued with a zeal that disregards the human element essential to DocuSign’s success."
DocuSign,4.0,"Mar 10, 2024",pay is fine,Account Executive,Former Employee,"Chicago, IL",if you hit your goals then your in great shape,"if you are struggling, then you will not see any benefits of the pay"
DocuSign,4.0,"Feb 16, 2024","Happy Team, Sad Org",Regional Vice President Sales,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Chicago, IL","- Outstanding compensation plan. Best commission plan I have seen in the industry. I have reps making well above their OTE.
- Great product that sells itself. People love eSignature and they want DocuSign. We are better than our competitors and customers are coming back.
- Easy product to sell that a new AE can be trained on in less than a week.
- Great teammates. My direct reports (Enterprise AEs), peers and direct manager are truly great people. I enjoy working with them.
- Fun ERG groups. There's always something fun going on.
- Great benefits (vacation, health insurance, ESPP, benevity, etc...)
- Work life balance is the best I have ever had. I feel in control of my job and my life.
- Support teams are great people (RMs, CSMs, SC's, MDRs). I do feel that they aren't reaching their potential though because of lack of direction from top executives. Frontline and Second Line Managers are great.","- This could be the best company in the world to work for but unfortunately there is just so much drama at an executive level that creates distractions. Almost the entire C-Suite has changed in the past 2-years. Every new executive comes in thinking they can do it better but they end up making it worse and falling back on how things were before.
- Executives have a weird level of involvement. It's all or nothing. Too much or too little. It can feel like they either don't exist or they pop up out of no where with a fire drill. 
- The product roadmap has been rebranded with the same content every single year for the past 5 years. There are rumors of a big new product and feature set but I will believe it when I see it.
- There's a lot of female and minority leaders that have left the company. When I started, leadership was incredibly diverse and it slowly went back to the good ole boys club from yester-year. The first club was like a frat house and I guess it now feels like a country club? Either way, it's sad to see so few women or diversity in leadership. This has got to change.
- Layoffs are beginning to feel like the new normal. In 2 years we have had 3 layoffs. Managers have zero insight into this or input into who leaves so it's a shock to all. 
- Executives seem to care more about international expansion than they do about improving the North American growth."

There is an attitude of arrogance that is thick. - Completely useless mandatory exercises that are repetitive and never looked at again after the initial effort. These exercises probably costed alot of money to come up with but add no value. - Nearly impossible to make quota. Even if you manage to sell something, there are countless ways they will deny your commission. - Lack of product roadmap. - Removal of NINE paid holidays and the CEO says to ""get over it"" while laughing in an all hands meeting. - Executive team is making a complete killing in compensation and still selling shares as quickly as they can. This does not send a good message to the working stiffs. - Return to office policy. Why is this necessary? This is not what the core problem is. - The culture that DocuSign was known for is vanishing before our eyes."

It's the best place I've ever worked, especially since I'm at the point in my career where I value work/life balance, while also making a meaningful, visible impact. 
The main pros for me -
Empowered to make decisions about the area I own
Expectation and encouragement to innovate
Work life balance - no expectation to work late or on the weekends. It still happens sometimes, but its certainly not worn like a badge of honor like it is at many companies
Great company culture and expectation for everyone to be helpful, responsive, and kind","Despite these cons below, I think we're turning the corner and things will be improving
Cons for me -
Stock not performing great currently
Working on coming out with new products and integration of products, but will take time
A lot of new execs and may have more changes coming down the line
Good comp but lower than some tech companies. To me, the work/life balance is well worth the lower tech comp that is still higher than other industries"

Opportunities to grow exist, but are hard to find. It really depends on your team and I've been lucky in this regard.","The company culture has changed over the years. When our current executive staff took over, they mentioned they loved the company culture and that's why they joined. They then proceeded to completely change the culture, employee first mindset, and started changing our benefits at our detriment."
DocuSign,2.0,"Jan 17, 2024",Look elsewhere for a sales role,Account Executive,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"-The managers I've worked directly for (RVP, AVP, VP) have all been amazing human beings and I've made strong relationships with my peers who are also great people

-There is potential to set us apart from our growing list of competitors which would alleviate a lot of pain as a seller

-Pay is decent","-Quotas are completely unattainable; about 10% of the reps in my direct organization will hit quota. It's mainly because they have bigger/better accounts within industries that have a higher propensity to buy than the other 90% of the reps and/or they were lucky enough to get territory overcarve from people who left. Just about every one of the bigger deals sold in the org this year have been right place right time situations and have been eSignature centric vs strategic deals/CLM deals

-Zero advancement opportunities. On top of the fact that quotas are nearly impossible to hit, there are virtually no advancement opportunities when you get to the Majors level or above. DocuSign was known for advancement opportunities for so long, but now there's no light at the end of the tunnel outside of just being able to keep your job. 

-Justifying the cost of our eSignature platform is becoming increasingly harder, especially to organizations that don't have very complex use cases. eSignature is becoming commoditized but leadership still thinks we should be able to charge outrageous prices just based off our name

-Sister teams like the renewal management team are not on the same page with AEs because they are compensated differently. RMs are compensated to mitigate churn while AEs are compensated on growth. This causes many scenarios where a RM will do anything to get a flat renewal which often takes any upsell off the table for AEs

-Morale is completely in the toilet. I am working twice as hard this year for half of what I made last year and I know that most of my peers are in the same situation. Everyone is in constant fear of losing their job which makes selling harder than it already is

-Executive leadership isn't doing much to turn things around. It's becoming more clear that the CEO and President of worldwide Field Ops came for a quick and easy pay day instead of truly trying to right the ship and their arrogance is palpable. The CEO laughs at questions during town hall meetings while the president of field ops is traveling to a different country every other week to do whatever he does. They say they're committed to the cause, then sell millions worth of stock the second they get the chance"

 - Return to office with no actual data to back up why we were forced back in 
- Terrible customer service. It truly feels like DocuSign does everything the hard way. We are way too expensive compared to competitors for what we offer
