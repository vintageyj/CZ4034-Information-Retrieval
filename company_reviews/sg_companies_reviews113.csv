Overall, Nityo Infotech provided a platform for me to learn, contribute, and thrive in my role.","While my experience at Nityo Infotech was generally positive, there were a few areas that could have been improved. Communication between departments sometimes seemed lacking, which occasionally led to misunderstandings or delays in project timelines. Additionally, there were moments when workload distribution could have been more balanced to prevent potential burnout among team members.

First of all do not join this company at any cost, No doubt that they will give you more salary you can't even expect that but do not come in their sugar quoted words. At any point of time no one will support you ever be it senior level your reporting manager, team manager or even the HRs. This is a big fraud company who follow hire and fire policy. They hire people for only for 6-8 months and then they put their employees on PIPs and ask them to complete an unachievable target which anyone will not be able to do. No one here gives respect to sales people. Recruiters are king here, they can do work from home anytime and they can take as many leaves as they want because they have less salaries but sales person have no right to do work from home, they have to come even on a natural disaster situations. Egoistic management, arrogant management. their ego gets hurt when you put down your papers or you are leaving and they treat you like their slaves. So incase if you have any other offer inhand then go for that only. This company will never provide you career growth. Never do increment, Increment policy - only after 2 years that too in October or Novemeber, They will give you false hope that they will call you Onsite and all but trust me nothing will happen. They will scold you every day for not achieving your weekly targets and with the name of punishment they will call you on saturdays when no one is coming but you only you will come. Worst culture. Zero level of employee satisfaction. Not even a single get together will be conducted. You come you see dead faces in front of you looking into their systems and then go. No interaction between any employees also they will not provide you any training. You have to learn from your own.
If you are from solutions background then do involve in recruitment because this is totally a recruitment agency, this is not a solution company. Initially they will ask you that sell solutions but after 1 or 2 weeks they will ask you to sell recruitment for your survival. They have no Salary criteria for any level of people, your junior will be taking more salary with zero knowledge.
Diwali giftings is just Rs.501. No extra gift not even a single sweets.
Major one is Salary Delay- They will give you salary after 15th of every month infact they have policy of crediting the salary between 7-10 but they don't follow their own policy. 
There are more cons but I want to conclude that this is a worst company to join. If you wanna see worst culture in corporate sector then join this company otherwise take your time sit unemployed but do not join this company."
