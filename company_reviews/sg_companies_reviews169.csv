Work life balance and pay is decent,"What a shame used to be amazing place to work 4 years ago when I started with a great almost cultish culture! All that is gone and current leadership is complete disaster. It feels like a high school clique, lead by the bully mean girl who‚Äôs not open to feedback. So many shenanigans, nobody believes in Twilio magic anymore. No enablement for SEs, we find about new features from clients. 3 layoffs and same mistakes with all, layoff AEs and leaving customers to hang without a new point of contact. We lost so many opportunities again due to layoffs and reorgs as customers had no new reps for 2+ months. Customers are frustrated and some opportunities were lost because ‚Äúwe‚Äôre on our 4th AE this year!‚Äù
Just came back from SKO and our newest coolest product is something you would see 5 years ago. No long term vision. Lost so many smart people and unfortunately I think many more are leaving."

Twilio,5.0,"Jan 26, 2024",Was great while it lasted ,Enterprise Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","San Francisco, CA","Thoughtful, transparent leadership 
Market leading product 
Many products in the bag to sell, and you can sell with confidence because the products are good 
Good management at every level. Collaborative deal execution. 
Very receptive leadership at every level to ideas. Leadership fully implemented feedback from even interns in order to improve things 
LOADS of resources to get deals done. 
Lots of learning opportunities. Lots of recognition for achievements.
Focus on D&I led to an incredibly diverse team and brilliant ideas. 26+ countries represented with massive growth outside of the US.
All this lent to an exceptional culture, there was no other company like this ever before. A lot of this magic is gone now.","Several layoffs due to over-hiring and over spending.
Unclear long term vision and execution behind that long term vision. 
Lack of long term thinking or learning from past issues in some ways
Far too many changes, pivots and reorgs. 1st line manager changes several times in a year.
New CEO, LOADS of C-suite changes over the years. 
Too frequent territory remapping. Losing accounts in September for example when you just start to get traction breaking into an account. 
Customers are jarred from switching account reps many, many times. 
Cumbersome internal processes, very hard to navigate how to close deals or get approvals. Twilio gets more in the way of deals closing than any competition. 
Total miss with 2nd and subsequent covid waves. Massive opportunity for revenue lost. 
Too much focus on lengthy product training vs sales execution 
Highly complex comp plan and thus there are many conflicts over comp payouts and timing
Very competitive and commoditized market. Twilio does well at differentiation and shipping new features for the roadmap, but just know that there will be loads of completion in every deal. 
Knowledge loss at every level as most tenured employees have left."

Twilio,3.0,"Jun 23, 2023",What could have been...,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"During the pandemic years, I had the opportunity to partner with some of the brightest and most collaborative marketers. Creative problem-solving was encouraged, and there was plenty of budget to think outside the box with targeted marketing campaigns. There was a clear vision provided from marketing leadership and we consistently charted our progress against key KPIs. I learned a lot from both peers and leaders at a pivotal juncture in my career. I was enamored by Twilio's commitment to being an anti-racist company, the Twilio magic principles, and of working in an environment of positivity. I left the company in early 2022 for an opportunity that I just couldn't decline (more responsibility, solving interesting problems, better benefits and compensation). I feel lucky to have left the company when I did, as I missed the mass layoffs and culture decline.","To put it bluntly, leadership has issues. This is true in marketing and org-wide. Since the hire of the new CMO, VP leadership in marketing have departed the company one by one‚Äîa telltale sign of a lack of faith of leadership's competence and the in the direction Twilio is headed in. The CEO Jeff has systematically mismanaged the company, yet refuses to step down. He refused to relinquish a misplaced faith to Twilio Flex, despite its low performance and lack of interest from customers. And now I fear Twilio Segment may be headed in the same direction,"

Twilio,2.0,"Dec 28, 2023",Changed Perspectives: Twilio's Evolving Leadership and Unmet Potential,Software Development Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Nashville, TN","Market-Aligned Compensation: Due to changing market dynamics, Twilio's salary offerings have naturally aligned with the median. While not a direct result of internal salary adjustments, this shift reflects the current competitive landscape in the tech industry, positioning Twilio's compensation packages within the average range.","Executive compensation appears misaligned with the company's financial performance. For example, the CEO's salary is notably higher than that of the CEO of Disney, a significantly more valuable and profitable company, raising questions about the appropriateness of such compensation amidst the company's financial challenges.

There has been a noticeable turnover in staff quality and efficiency. High-performing individuals ('A players') have largely departed, and the current team composition poses challenges to rapid and effective cross-functional collaboration.

The company culture has shifted towards a more political environment, particularly at the Director level and above. This shift often results in decisions that prioritize short-term gains or personal agendas over long-term company benefits, such as the underutilization of costly tools despite expert recommendations.

There's a tendency to view team underperformance as an issue with individual contributors rather than a reflection of leadership effectiveness. This perspective is contributing to a culture where systemic issues are not adequately addressed.

Management style has increasingly favored political maneuvering over strategic competence. A notable number of managers lack a deep understanding of the strategies and tactics pertinent to their functions, which, coupled with poor decision-making, has had a significant cost impact on the business."

Executives make awful decisions then try to act like these are hard decisions to make when they do 3 rounds of layoffs in the course of a year, when it doesn't impact them and in fact makes them more money. 

There is no rhyme or reason to who is laid off, it doesn't matter how long they have been with the company, if they are a top performer or not, they are just released. 

The company will make game changing decisions that no one below the exec level feels is a good idea then when it backfires, the only people who suffer are the same people who knew it wasn't a good decision."

Unfortunately, the enthusiasm of many of these employees drained over the last year in light of faltering leadership (see cons). Work/life balance was fantastic, with remote work opportunities and unlimited PTO.","Management at all levels is a disaster. The leadership changes direction so regularly that it is difficult for teams to achieve their goals. Not only is this frustrating, but over time the cumulative impact of projects repeatedly being discarded is a huge hit to morale. Team and departmental management lacked the skills needed to motivate and grow their employees; in my 2 years at Twilio I was rarely provided with any practical leadership or professional development opportunities despite asking for them. Despite their stated commitment to diversity and inclusion, my experience was that men were regularly favored over women in terms of promotions, leadership opportunities, stretch assignments, and access to their skip-level managers. The majority of their stated anti-racist layoffs, at least on my team, consisted of women, people of color, and people with disabilities. It is my opinion that the DEI team that was established is just for optics; my team regularly interacted with them and they had a reputation for using intimidation and bullying tactics to achieve their goals - completely counteractive to how a DEI team should behave."

I worked in TA and my candidates had to go through 3-4 rounds of interviews which felt insane even for my green entry level roles. We undoubtedly missed out on really strong talent because of this process. hiring managers want everything in a candidate but then are baffled when we lose out on them because we took too long in the process.

Team collaboration, transparent communication, cutting-edge technology, professional development opportunities and a focus on employee well being are just some of the pros to call out from a company standpoint. Twilio believes in giving recruiters the autonomy to make important decisions. Our strong employer brand, competitive compensation and benefits are very well received in the market.",You need to be comfortable working remote as our real estate footprint has shrank.
Twilio,5.0,"Mar 24, 2023",Essential product in the tech stack,Customer Success Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"Competitive salary, 401k match, RSUs, remote work with option to go into the office. Many smart and kind ICs. Catered lunches at the offices. Sells a product that is essential to almost any business that wants to have a smart/modern customer engagement strategy. Seen as the leader in the CPaaS space. I always felt that my work was valued at Twilio. APIs are excellent.","Layoffs were obviously a huge hit. The company is looking to be profitable and is making business decisions to get there. This is completely understandable. For go to market teams, the reality is there were too many cooks in the kitchen. One person can, and should do the job of three. Company is going through growing pains and is trying to iron out business goals and objectives to get to the next level. The company isn't in a bad place, it's just going through reorganization/""how to get to the next level"" progressions. You could argue over-hiring has played a major role in that."
Twilio,2.0,"Apr 15, 2023",Get your act together!,Principal Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"Good pay, some great people and an interesting problem set. There is much that needs to be done to modernize the tech stack and many interesting challenges to work on, if you happen to get a leader that is able to see this and empower you to take them on.","Leadership is a real mess at Twilio. Constantly shifting priorities, infighting, politics, lack of vision, low levels of technical understanding, all blanketed with a lack of awareness of these weaknesses. The company was oriented around growth and when that suddenly stopped being the focus, ended up destroying its culture to try to adapt to the changing market. Silos that were marginally annoying in 2021 turned into WWI style entrenchments in 2023 where directorial fiefdoms prevent any sense of community or ability to collaborate outside the scrum team."

The losses due to the stock is not covered in terms of cash(base-pay) - Removed all employee perks in order to achieve profitability but not seeing any substantial change in last one year - Since the time I have joined, seen a lot of reorganization(May be due to market conditions)"
Twilio,3.0,"Jan 12, 2023",A decent home for a house cat designer.,Visual Designer III,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"Twilio is remote first, you're not required to come into an office if you live near one of their locations. The company takes personal growth and development seriously. I've never seen a company allow you to train and expand your professional skills on company dime and time. It's amazing. The compensation is on par or above what a designer at this level would make in house or at an agency. The benefits are decent, Healthcare offerings could be improved. Specifically dental, there's only one option. Unlimited PTO is great, there's a good culture on my team that encourages folks to take off. Overall this a relatively low stress environment for a designer who is okay with having a clock-in, collect, repeat mentality. You won't make the most groundbreaking work but it's a comfortable place to grow and look towards the future.","In the field of design, Twilio is a place like many others. You probably won't move up until somebody leaves. It's top heavy with several mid-senior level designers and art directors. The title structure makes growth feel like an unnecessarily long venture. Example - there are 3 steps of visual design positions before you could become a Senior designer. This trend continues up the ladder. You're designing for a pretty niche audience and the subject matter is dense. It's challenging to understand who you're designing for. Probably best suited for designers that also have an interest in programming although it's not required and you could do the job without knowing any coding languages."

Even the CEO will tell you, ‚ÄúWe are Developer First,‚Äù meaning they still haven‚Äôt figured out to care and cultivate their sales org. There is no sense of direction especially when it comes to sales and generating revenue, even though obtaining profitability at all costs is the goal. So why lay off a ton of top performers just to appear ‚Äúfair‚Äù if generating revenue is so important?! You‚Äôre not really selling here either, you‚Äôre promoting platform consumption and cheerleading to developers to use the platform. You do more account management then prospect. The comp plan is the most confusing on the market as well. It should of have been a red flag when I asked ten different people to explain the comp plan and got ten different answers. Even if you‚Äôre over performing, you are at risk of being cut if they don‚Äôt achieve their financial goals every quarter."

The sales leadership was cold and not helpful. Was told by senior leaders that they didn't value sales development and that my team needed to prove them wrong. Easier said than done when there was no cohesive message from marketing and sales, quotas made no sense, and they forced SDRs to use awful pre-written templates for outbound."

Poor at improving morale, rallying around a common goal, or inspiring people to do their best. Pockets of toxic micro managers and hands off checked out teams that are burned out on the operating model. 
Terrible at execution of any sales related motion. CEO continually doubts if sales is necessary for product success despite massive growth from direct sales efforts. 
Wild swings in strategy that led to mass layoffs."
