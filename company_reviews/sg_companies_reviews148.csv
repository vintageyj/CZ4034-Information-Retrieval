ShopBack,4.0,"Sep 4, 2023",Not For Everyone (But Excellent For Some),Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Singapore,"- Lots of learning and growth. Plenty of opportunities if you seize them (and earn people's trust along the way) - Fast paced and dynamic culture. Pivot quickly, and implement new things at lightning speed. - Teams of highly talented people. People are highly intelligent and are comfortable with complexity. - Great leadership (esp CEO)","- Some tumult in business outlook, esp with BNPL closure of one market and multiple (and quickly successive) departures of key figures in that business - Lack of work-life balance. Tight deadlines, quick turnarounds, and intense stress to excel. Might not be for everyone's personality and/or current phase of life right now - Lack of diversity in strengths, personalities, and backgrounds. Results in certain traits being self-selecting over time, which can breed very rigid (possibly elitist) thinking over time. - Almost no formal DEI initiatives, and what is being done is mostly for B2C marketing campaigns (e.g. international women's day). Expect very little support as it's not seen as a company priority at all (literally the last thing on the list) - Some toxic personalities in middle management"
ShopBack,1.0,"Feb 1, 2024",Think Twice: A Cautionary Review for Prospective Employees,Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Singapore,Hybrid working arrangement is the only one I can think of.,"Working at ShopBack is challenging, and unfortunately not in the positive sense. The company suffers from a significant lack of planning, often setting arbitrary deadlines that seem disconnected from project realities. This approach breeds a chaotic work environment where overtime is not just common but explicitly encouraged. The expectation to work nights, weekends, and even holidays is glorified, with the CTO publicly praising such unsustainable practices.

While compensation is average, the expectation to deliver high-quality work under these conditions is unreasonable. Work-life balance is virtually non-existent, as personal time is frequently encroached upon by work demands.

There's a discernible culture that values compliance over competence, where 'yes men' are favored over those who genuinely contribute through hard work. This environment is compounded by a management style that fails to advocate for team members, often leaving them feeling unsupported and undervalued."
ShopBack,4.0,"Feb 15, 2024",Work-Life Balance + Standard Pay,Operations Associate,Current Employee,,"Depending on your role within the company, you can achieve a a happy medium in terms of work-life balance. Nonetheless, the salary offered is decent. Theres a good company culture going on at ShopBack with continuous development opportunities to grow your skills.","* While the company offers AL, Sick Leave, and company stocks to vest - the downside to some of the benefits include no company provided insurance plans. Furthermore, if you travel for your role or have to purchase misc. adhoc items, you have to front the cost upfront and wait to expense the items to be reimbursed."

ShopBack,5.0,"Sep 14, 2023",ShopBack is one of the best companies Ive worked with,Regional Operations Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Singapore,"1. management shares their visions and progress towards common goals monthly via townhall, with great details, very candid. this helps everyone in the company (now we have 1000+ employees) to know and ask questions via slido 2. Bosses give a lot of freedom to employees to decide what they wanna do. it doesn't stop there, bosses are supportive in terms of giving guidance and will fight for the resources you need (of course you need to prove what you do is impactful) 3. Most people in the companies are quite willing to help each other. No question is dumb, and normally we can ask the same question again and again until we fully understand 4. People here work hard, peer pressure is healthy for most to constantly upskill themselves. a bit stressed short term, but fruitful long term 5. We also play hard. You heard of whole company annual retreat on a Yacht? or flying to Phuket, or have a whole Club (the ones with drinks and music)? ya thats ShopBack","1. processes are still quite manual. means sometimes we need to OT to get things done, while in other more mature companies, it could have been automated 2.should have been more proactive in engaging employees what skills they wanna develop and provide trainings. currently we do have IDP, but many people dont use it"

Commission structures were poorly planned, resulting in frequent changes that often had negative impacts on earnings. The management was known for engaging in gossip, creating an environment of mistrust and backstabbing among employees. Despite claiming to understand the challenges faced by employees in dealing with client objections, management failed to provide effective solutions. Employees were expected to maintain a high standard of work and often had to perform tasks outside of their designated roles, without any corresponding increase in salary. Standard Operating Procedures were constantly changing, resulting in frequent adjustments to administrative duties. Management seemed to believe that employees should be grateful for the opportunity to work at Shopback, a company they considered prestigious, and viewed departures as ingratitude on the part of employees who chose to leave."
