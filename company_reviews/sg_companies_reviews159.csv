I loved meeting and working with the Tableau Zen Masters.","After Adam took over things changed. By the time Salesforce bought them, nobody above my manager knew, or seemed to care, who I was. The goalposts toward promotion were constantly moving. I absolutely delivered, got top ratings in my performance reviews, and believe I was well liked by my peers; but I never did get the promotion I was after, and eventually I allowed myself to be hired away."

This is where the pros stop for me Amazing parental support (parental leave, fertility support, out of state abortion assistance)","This job was an amazing opportunity however the amount of responsibility you have versus the time you have to get things done is ridiculous. The processes here are not fully defined and are extremely time consuming and long (especially on the tableau side). To get a quote out it takes two approvals with no discounting and extra approvals if discounting is needed. Approvals can take days and you will constantly be submitting SOP requests. The work life balance is not there at all, and the remote workforce is a detriment when it comes to onboarding, training, promoting a culture, team cohesion etc. The differences between the way Tableau reps are supported vs Salesforce reps is astonishing and creates division in many cases. My biggest complaint is purely just that the entire company feels like everyone is purely a number."

Tableau Software,4.0,"Aug 25, 2022",A shadow of its former self,Systems Engineer,Former Employee,,If you are looking for a slow and steady corprorate job - Salesforce/Tableau might be good for you.,"People say that the company has been on a steady downhill trajectory since the Salesforce acquisition, but the reality is that the decline has started long before that. In the early days (late 00's and early 10's) the company had a truly innovative product and an amazing team that revolutionized the BI market. Now it just follows the rest of the industry, building features that on paper address the latest Gartner's hype cycle but in reality dont do anything for customers. (other BI vendors are guilty of that too). After the acquisition many teams have been absorbed into the Salesforce mothership; there is basically no more Tableau."
Tableau Software,1.0,"Apr 21, 2023",Used to be awesome. Destroyed by Salesforce,Principal Member of Technical Staff,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Kirkland, WA",This was probably the best place I've worked for a while.,And then Salesforce took over and is destroying everything that was good about Tableau. All the Tableau leaders who were well respected are now gone as are many of the strong individuals. Hard to imagine more of a culture clash between the great collaborative culture that Tableau had and the cultish culture of Salesforce.

It's easy to sell a genuinely awesome product you know can help people. The product is an industry leader and SF is even bigger so the names alone help the sale.,"SF killed the company I loved. Tableau wasn't perfect but it was pretty amazing all things considered. Big enough company to carry a global name, yet there was a lot of room for creative freedom regarding how you owned and operated your business and your time. 

SF completely murdered all sense of individuality and creativity. It's extremely corporate now. Red tape everywhere. Everything has a process... almost all preposterously long and convoluted. More mandatory trainings than I've ever seen... I have nothing against training if they are actually going to bring value. But they roll out mandatory trainings just to tick boxes. 

TOTAL LACK OF DIVERSITY. OMG, can we have more white men in leadership roles? Nope. Just an endless sea of mediocre white men who only want to lead for the titles with their bros."

Tableau Software,1.0,"Feb 19, 2023",WAS the best company I ever worked,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,Tableau was truly a special place. Wonderful people on a mission to help people see and understand data. It felt like everyone was trying to move in the same direction to achieve a common goal. I really enjoyed coming in to work and my teammates.,"The Salesforce acquisition led to a gradual decline. While at first we were hopeful that there was an opportunity to both learn from SF and have SF learn from Tableau, it became very clear that SF leadership had limited desire to incorporate strengths from Tableau. At the same time, the ability to make decisions and / or make any progress gradually disappeared. As a result, many of Tableau best employees left."

Good benefits.,"Post Salesforce acquisition there have been a lot of changes, re-orgs, and revisions of strategy. Resources are very tight with the hiring freeze that has been in place for some time, and now we've lost ~10% of our workforce. The latter has caused low morale and overwhelming work on those who survived."
Tableau Software,3.0,"May 31, 2022",A planet being torn apart by its new star.,Software Architect,Current Employee,,"Tableau has wonderful people who've built some really amazing products, and a very creative and caring fan base. There are some very interesting challenges at this time to work on as well. They pay decently well, and have good but not great benefits (i.e., Salesforce vs say Google, Facebook or Microsoft).","The Salesforce acquisition. SF is not creative and an online only business, Tableau is a desktop and server business with online extensions existing in a creative space. SF doesn't understand either context and will destructively copy Tableau into whatever it thinks Tableau should be. Until Salesforce finishes this process there will be a huge amount of chaos,  ambiguity, and churn. People will leave at a high rate, context will drain and you'll have something completely new once complete. Luckily they've put into place a hiring freeze to spare new folks this experience."

Tableau Software,4.0,"Dec 29, 2022",Good place to work,Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Seattle, WA","Great product, nice people, decent pay",Salesforce's processes are becoming too much
Tableau Software,3.0,"Dec 14, 2022",Depends on your team!,Digital Marketing Specialist,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Seattle, WA","The product! First and foremost, getting to learn how to use the product and the ability to get certified for free in Tableau is an amazing opportunity. If you are lucky to have a good manager, Tableau is a great place to work. It has great benefits, great people, and a great foundation to build your career on. You have the opportunity to travel. You have access to a data structure that will teach you how good analytics software should work. They have a lot of programs for the employee benefit: Lyra Health, a hotline for minority employees to get help (not very helpful), employee groups…but they still struggle with DEI. But they are at least aware of what needs to happen and make an effort to be considerate/inclusive. Decent annual/quarterly planning.","I got stuck under two terrible managers back-to-back. One manager I reported to HR. I know of three other women that reported him to HR and they still protected him and gaslit us all individually. Although I was told I was exceeding expectations during performance reviews, I never received a raise or promotion. My career growth was stagnant here and I saw no way up rather than getting out, in which I was able to start at a new company making $30,000 more. Tableau was acquired by Salesforce, which is also still making it difficult to be at Tableau right now. Salesforce has a bit of a cringey culture that can be toxically positive. There are also obvious pay gaps between employees doing the same level of work but they’re able to make it acceptable by keeping underrepresented groups at lower levels. Some incompetent mid-level managers who are good at puffing their chests and using buzzwords."

Tableau Software,4.0,"Mar 17, 2022",It was a great introduction into the software world.,Senior Account Executive,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","I loved all the opportunities to grow and learn ( World-class training, coaching, mentorship etc... ) We also had a two-week boot camp that helped us get familiar with the product and refine our selling style.","At times it felt like a boys club, especially in leadership. The woman leaders we did have were very in their masculine and unrelatable. We grew very quickly and it felt very clunky. Communication was siloed within the orgs. and often times was conflicting ( For example we had a foosball table in the kitchen but told not to use it.... I didn't care about Foosball, but to me it seemed like the company wanted to seem ""cool"" for the outside, but that was not the reality we where living..) The atmosphere felt very negtive the last couple years I was there and I did not feel supported."
Tableau Software,5.0,"Dec 10, 2021",Best company and leadership  ...so far,Solutions Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"We have some of the best leadership, mostly those coming from Tableau (not Salesforce...sorry SF). The leadership of Tableau is the BEST and I have had a lot of managers in my life. The SF acquisition is still shaking out, and their values and how they treat employees is not the same as the amazing Tableau leadership. I am m not saying everyone is perfect by no means, there are some Tableau SE Managers that I wonder how they got there....but the majority are AMAZING. I love this company","They are losing a lot of people because of PAY. Pay your people more and they wont leave. We do the work, we give results, and we should be paid.

Tableau Software,3.0,"Oct 27, 2021",Tableau lost its groove,Program Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Seattle, WA","* Truly excellent product to be proud of working on
* Super smart and kind folks to learn from
* Solid benefits, including paid volunteer time off
* SF actually does throw its weight around on social & environmental issues in a way that makes you feel good","* Salesforce made a GREAT sales pitch about the acquisition, but that good sales pitch isn't reality
* Senior and tenured employees are leaving in droves — far more than a typical M&A — due to changes in how work gets done, talked about, and prioritized in the new Salesforce world
* Most employees do NOT use the product anymore and have no incentive to do so — and no repercussions for straight-up refusing to learn (a thing that is becoming common)
* It has become harder to operate in ambiguity and harder to operate in general with all the extra SF training, enablement, weekly All Hands, VPN-switching, clunky security (sometimes 2FA more like 4 or 8FA), and admin overhead
* Fewer opportunities for internal mobility and compensation growth
* A lot more ""just outsource that new headcount to India"" behavior
* The stock cliff has gotten far worse after the acquisition for lower-level employees — higher level ICs and managers are looked after marginally better"
Tableau Software,3.0,"Oct 2, 2022",Dying by Degrees,Senior Technical Support Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Seattle, WA",Tableau used to offer excellent Support until the SF takeover. Training was excellent and knowledge resources were abundant. Great eclectic team to work with of the smartest people.,"Since the SF takeover support engineers have been asked to do more and more with less and less. Nobody can keep up with increased expectations, and pay has stagnated. Experienced techs are leaving and not being replaced, or being replaced in Hyderabad. Former paths for advancement seem to have been cut off."
Tableau Software,5.0,"Apr 6, 2022",Great place to work,Associate Technical Support Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Seattle, WA","Management is concerned about their team and the well-being of the individuals.
Easy to use PTO without feeling like you are a burden on other team members
Colleagues are ready to help you with cases or take them over when you are out.
When there are issues upper management really does try to fix them.
The majority of the customer is awesome.
Interdepartmental communication is good and account reps are very helpful.
Direct report managers are the best.","Feels like there is a disconnect from ground level to upper management on some topics.

Tableau Software,2.0,"Oct 19, 2021",Apply Anywhere Else,Order Management Coordinator,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Seattle, WA",You get paid and you get some sort of corporate experience.,"If you’re into being micromanaged, undermined, and treated like a kindergartener, this is the job for you. When you can and can’t take your PTO is extremely controlled (i.e. three black out days at the end of each month and eight and the end of each quarter), sales will walk all over you and management will do nothing about it. Over half of Deal Desk’s work was transferred to OM without any adequate compensation or tangible training. This team is continuously treated as entry level when this is clearly not the case - it was three years ago but once DD decided to hand over the majority of their work, this team requires some form of experience in the workforce and for some reason managers continue to hire people with no form of knowledge. Tableau is notorious for underpaying their employees - making less than $60k in tech while living in the city of Seattle is just unacceptable. There is no encouragement for career growth. Since COVID hit, management has had no regard for personal time and increased the work load while barely addressing a worldwide pandemic. Management has failed time and time again to have any sort of communication skills with their team. Seattle is full of startups - apply to literally any of those before Tableau."

Tableau Software,3.0,"Sep 7, 2022",Very repetitive work duties,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",,Friendly supervisors. Good company culture,Felt difficult to progress into higher level roles since hard work wasn’t rewarded. Promotions to higher paying roles were only due to time at the company.
Tableau Software,3.0,"Jul 28, 2021",Falling apart,Sales,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Austin, TX","Great benefits
Tableau the product is great and easy to sell 
The people are awesome","Culture has crumbled in a remote world and with the Salesforce takeover. Feels like management is doing the bare minimum at all times for their team and only focused on improving their own career paths. No communication from leadership on the path to a promotion and lots of new rules because of Salesforce. Yet be prepared at the end of each year to be bounced to a new team or territory with zero say and then told you have to stay there for a minimum of 6 months. Sales enablement is a joke. Management spends zero time mentoring, training or even reviewing deals with their team. Pay is way below market. Nearly everyone is unhappy and looking to leave this sinking ship. Working with Salesforce Core AEs is a nightmare. Most are rude and condescending and actually are pushing Tableau OUT of deals but management is scared of SF leadership and so don't say anything."
Tableau Software,2.0,"Mar 23, 2022","If you want to be paid what you're worth, move on",Associate Solutions Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"Benefits are fantastic, reimbursement programs are expansive","If you're a BIPOC, person with disabilities or a woman, you won't be treated fairly or equitably. You'll be expected to do far more above your job description and pay grade to even be recognized among your peers and if you want to have a work-life balance and separation you will be punished for it. Pay is not competitive for the market at all unless you're a new hire, once you're hired though you cannot make any sort of career advance internally."

Tableau Software,1.0,"Jun 10, 2022",Actively Automating This Role Away,Senior Renewal Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Seattle, WA","Remote, hybrid work environment. Salesforce is very considerate of individual people's tolerance for risk during the pandemic and prioritizes our health and comfort levels.","Cannot overstate how underpaid and overworked existing employees are. Without RSUs anymore (removed during the Salesforce acquisition) many talented individuals have left for other opportunities and salary offers of 50%+ more (no exaggeration).

This has left existing Renewal Managers to ""pick up the slack"" often double, triple coveraging. Double coveraging has become the norm and status quo. This has lead to a general burnout and low morale. 

Migration to Salesforce system was horrendous. Completely under prepared (~2 hours of live training, several ineffective e-learning modules, hard to track documentation). Countless sleepless night and breakdowns for many Renewal Managers as Customers yelled at us for losing access to Tableau due to our inability to quote and renew on time. 

Leadership's toxic positivity. If you don't ""drink the Koolaid"" you're viewed as a negative Nancy, ignored and passed for promotions. The leadership team full of young, white fat boys with fragile egos can't take an ounce of constructive feedback. They will never own up to issues laid out by the team leaving persistent issues unresolved. The denial is deep. No wonder why everyone is leaving.

Tableau is gone and Salesforce has swept in to ""scale"" the business. Another fancy tech buzzword for automating our jobs away. ""Scaling"" is actively being accomplished with a multi pronged approach:

- replacing back fills with cheaper, contractors from the Philippines 
- tying our compensation to multi-year contracts
- defaulting renewals to automatically renew
- chatting with ""bots"" to get our job done. can't even chat internally with a real human being for help

Concerned about the job security of this role."
