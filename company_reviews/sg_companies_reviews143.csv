Independence in role","Great company overall, few cons would be the turnover rate is high in this company. In my team alone of about 30 people, within this year,  we lost about 5+ members not to mention the turnover rate amongst senior leaders throughout the company.

Salary is decent, but they could do better with yearly raises and bonuses. They always promote how well the company is doing, but it isn’t reflected in the raises or bonuses.

Another con would be the constant changes and lack of stability that comes with it. I’ve started under TR, then it became Refinitiv and now it’s LSEG. Too many rebrands and re-orgs which is draining.

Lastly,  is a personal preference, but I don’t like how woke this company is. Very left-wing and politicized agendas are brought up often in town-halls. I don’t care about race, gender or religion constantly being pushed in the workplace. The diversity efforts is very forced and uncomfortable. All I care about if you’re a hardworking individual who is capable of doing the job. I don’t know why all the other stuff matters."
