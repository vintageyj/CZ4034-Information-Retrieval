The product was perfect at the beginning of the company.,"Changed in the IT management and throughout the company had to switch the cultural aspects although following the large company guidelines introducing politics in every department team.

Starting pay is strong, and healthcare package (as of 2022) is incredibly good, especially for family.

Focus is on competency, in North Carolina. Having a fancier degree doesn't get you any more attention/special treatment, and talented folks with less formal credentials get their shot to be experts. Strong social diversity in hiring.","Nutanix privately sold a bunch of equity to Bain in late 2020, after which things started going downhill:
* Within 18 months, SREs were expected to have twice the output, with no compensation changes.

* CEO left the company around this time, ""totally unrelated."" Company doubled down on its aims and rhetoric around becoming profitable. Obviously the company needs to be profitable to survive, but in my opinion they are doing so at the cost of intangibles - customer loyalty, product quality, employee wellness.

* Company culture is being gutted if it is not reportable/justifiable. Employees are given less agency and less time to be creative. Middle managers gaslight any employees who point out recent changes.

--- GENERAL ---

* Salaries are suppressed. I made more money as a recently-hired SRE 2 than several SRE 3s I spoke with, who had stayed at the company 5+ years. 

* For Support specifically: Middle managers are disorganized and uncoordinated. Support leadership has no agency to secure the needs of the SREs. Healthcare package will likely be watered down within 5 years."

•Fantastic support and engineering 
•New leadership and fresh blood that is ready to work to make us more profitable and the best out there!

Like everywhere in this great resignation era culture- we have had some turnover. However, I think it was all for the better of the company. The employees that had been here 5+ years had been resting on their laurels - hiding out. Most were not interested in truly digging in and working hard.

Such a cliche term, but the people here are genuinely good people, working together to disrupt the IT industry. Not a cut throat environment, we’re all pushing in the same direction.

-Challenge. If you love to be stretched, challenged, trusted, pushed to your limit then you’ll thrive in this company.

-Compensation. Pay is competitive, benefits are covered 100%, stock and ESPP give an added bump. 

-Management. There are some really good managers and mentors at Nutanix, if you’re aligned to them then you’ll love your job. The executive leadership of the company is 2nd to none.","-Culture. If you want structure, clear growth paths, to move up the chain quickly and your value is based on your title and praise... we’re not there yet. Everyone is so focused on getting the work done that we don’t spend a lot of time on employee recognition and development. Career growth and development are pushed by HR but their not structured or adopted enough to be mainstream.  

-Challenge. The fast pace and demand is not for the light hearted. If you thrive in that type of environment you’ll be happy here.

-Management. There are a lot of team managers who are stronger individual contributors than they are managers. Advice: really do your homework on who you’ll be reporting to and what their management style is."

Nutanix,2.0,"Feb 16, 2022","Great, in the early days",Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",,"I started at Nutanix pre-IPO and when it was relatively small (<500 employees). Benefits were great, pay was at market for the time, and going through the IPO process was pretty cool. The culture for the first few years was amazing, nothing like I've ever experienced. Early on, the product worked well, was simple and was differentiated among a competitive market.","Post-IPO is when things started to change. There was lots of ""leadership"" brought in from other big-name competitors which changed the culture drastically and that started a mass-exodus of existing leadership and employees that were there for a long time. The product become overly complex and riddled with bugs. Once the pricing structure changed, the products became too expensive for what they were, even with drastic discounting. If you were fortunate enough to sell and make your quota, renewals were ridiculously expensive and renewal rates plummeted. Territories were split (even smaller markets) and new teams were brought in to ""increase revenue"", which did nothing more than invoke backstabbing in the field across GEO's and verticals. Execs will talk at length about the Annual Contract Value (ACV) growth, but when you really look at overall revenue over the last several years, it's quite stagnate."
