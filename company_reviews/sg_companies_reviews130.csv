Asurion,5.0,"Feb 5, 2024",Great Company,Software Engineer III,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Nashville, TN","Abundant chances for learning, professional development, and advancement within the organization. Flexibility to choose projects that ignite your passion, generous time-off options, and a strong commitment to maintaining a healthy work-life balance.","The cons include mandatory in-office work within the general area of main locations, tightening restrictions on PTO, variable bonus amounts dependent on company performance, and a hierarchical structure with limited influence from immediate managers on work/life requirements."
Asurion,2.0,"Mar 5, 2024",Competitve & Sales Oriented,Technical Support & Sales,Former Employee,"Orlando, FL","If you relish the idea of your job outcomes being directly tied to your sales prowess, then this role aligns perfectly with your preferences. Excelling in sales affords you the privilege of dictating your schedule, earning higher compensation, and enjoying exclusive perks. However, for those whose sales performance falls in the mediocre range, the absence of tangible benefits is accompanied by recurring coaching sessions aimed at improvement with a threat of being fired if you don't.","Their sole focus is on sales, neglecting the provision of exceptional technical support. The true essence of teamwork eludes them, despite their claims of fostering collaboration among teams. Instead of promoting unity, they create an environment where individuals are pitted against each other. Actions are taken not out of genuine necessity but rather to impart lessons. Moreover, a prevalent air of self-congratulation permeates the organization."
Asurion,4.0,"Mar 11, 2024",Good People,Director,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Nashville, TN",Enjoyed working with incredibly talented people across the marketing and analytics departments. Good leadership from the CMO and VP of Marketing.,Company seems to be in flux with some of the service lines other than phone insurance.
Asurion,3.0,"Mar 9, 2024",Corporate don’t care,Store Leader,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Plainfield, IL",Money is good if u can hot ure metrics,I’ve seen jobs loss. I seen ppl written up. I seen the absolute no support from high up. As management not only am i taking charge of my store but also marketing.. multi billion dollar company and can’t afford to assist in anything…
Asurion,1.0,"Feb 14, 2024",RUN AWAY!!!! Do not work here! Toxic Atmosphere!,Sales and Customer Service Representative,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",,Pay per call can be good. Until they manually reduce your metrics so you aren't paid as much. Insurance seems good for a group plan.,"Asurion Middle and Upper management is absolutely clueless. They do not care anything about the customers and just want you to pitch Home Tech Protection until the customer either buys or dies. Shady sales approach. Reps continually lie just to get a sale, with no reprimand by management. Unrealistic sales goals if you have even a shred of integrity. A revolving door of reps who do not have a clue what they are doing and coaches who do not care if they mess up customer's claims as long as they sell the protection. This organization should be ashamed of themselves. What a joke. Is in no way shape or form a sales job. As sleazy as it gets! Do not do it!"

Asurion,2.0,"Nov 16, 2023",They have changed,Customer Service Specialist,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Nashville, TN",The pay is wonderful! You get your hourly rate plus bonus for sales and meeting metrics.,"It is very hard to achieve the monthly sales goals. When people have called in repeatedly they hear our sales pitch every time. Customers say no once, twice, three times before we can stop our pitch. Our coaches listen to our calls and rate them. They pick them apart with a fine tooth comb and yes they will say great job doing this or you did that perfectly, but they will also ask why you didn't get the sale and why you didn't ask them a fourth time etc. We were basically suppose to badger the customer until they give in and say yes. We were told it was no longer a customer service position, that it was now a SALES position. If you don't make your sales goal for a month, you get a warning. The next time a written warning and then you get terminated. When I was first hired you got to pick your own schedule, right down to when your breaks were. Now you have to bid on shifts and if your sales aren't meeting goal, you won't get anything close to what you need for a schedule."
Asurion,1.0,"Jan 12, 2024","Awful, exploitative workplace",Technician,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Milwaukee, WI",Good team support at store level,"-Awful management, always says ""reach out for help if you need it!"" and then either refuses to help or flat out doesn't know the answer and will not assist further. 
-Does not care at ALL for employees. Constant understaffing, cannot retain employees, raises are next to nothing, promotions often denied to women who also make less money than male coworkers
-Sketchy hiring policies. Bait and switch upon hiring, will offer you a job and then say ""oh by the way we changed the role"" after you already signed contracts. They also offered me a higher pay on the phone, confirmed with me on the phone, and then my offer letter had a lesser amount.
-Poor training. Expects coworkers to teach new hires.
-Sketchy firing practices. Employees who make them the most money in sales are HIGHLY prioritized and favored, even to the point of letting them get away with multiple infractions other people were fired for.
-Impossible workload. Massively stressful. Often sends employees to other stores to cover and is forced to host ""repair parties"" where employees work OT until midnight to get workload down.
-Management takes frequent PTO and gets flown to Florida multiple times a year to get drunk and take time off while their employees don't even get sick pay.
-People quit without even finishing training. Often.
-NO SICK PAY."
Asurion,1.0,"Feb 22, 2024",Warning,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,I met some good people while i was there .,Stress will be your best friend. Asurion sticks with same process and does not want to improve anything especially when it comes to agent lying to get a sale. don't blame them because company puts a pressure on them. PTO you earn it but to use it is another problem . if you are not a SALES person Asurion is not for you. You sale then you good. you don't you are going to get harassed by the coach/supervisor until you quit or get fired. you also get promised to move up but it never happens. i have met some good people who left for something better. if you care about your mental health look elsewhere.

Great work-life balance.,Stay as far away from the Security dept as possible! Senior leadership shows favoritism towards their favorites and will not support you when you need it. If you need help with anything they will leave you on an island to fend for yourself and will take the credit from the higher ups on your hard work. The HR dept will back them up if you say anything about it also. STAY AWAY from Security if you want to like your job.

The description of the position was to drive to people’s home and provide them with a five star experience by setting up their replacement phones. Nothing about sales. Now the focus is on sales and experts are using every sales tactic bad and good to get the home protection sale. Experts are lying to get a sale. Not only that but also have to sell Verizon 5g and Fios to eligible customers plus accessories, upgrades and new lines. We only have 23 mins to spend with the customers. Routing is so bad that we can’t take our breaks properly otherwise more than one job will be late and it’s not fair to these customers. Operations need to focus on the above."

Benefits start on the first day.,"I started with the company in 2004, filing claims. I moved to tech support and then escalations, where I was stuck for the next twelve years until I gave up and quit. 

The company hired a guy who turned the entire company into a metrics and stats game where everyone but management, including tech support, has to upsell various add-ons. If they don't they get fired. I saw this happen at Sprint, in 2003. It took awhile for Sprint to tank, but it did. It's going to take Asurion awhile to tank, but watch it. Let's not forget that Eddie Limpert turned Sears into a metrics and stats game, pitting all the sections of the company against each other."

Fast - Asurion is a massive company with a lot of people, but it doesn't take long for great decisions to get action within your team or partner teams. Everyone is running in the same direction and accept great ideas no matter where they come from. There's even a place for ANY employee to suggest ideas and process improvements to the C suite. People - There's a theme here with people. From the interview process to the onboarding process to the continuing education inside the building - this is a company that really, really cares.

The commissions are pitiful, at most $25/sale and their rules about trying to record people in their own homes make customers very uncomfortable and distrustful, and since you aren't allowed to contact customers after the deliveries you're given no opportunity to save a cancellation, but the company still counts them against you. I was #1 salesman in the region for 3 months, even met the ceo and had a photo op, but because my numbers were good they gave me more stops on my route, which I appreciated, however, since I was then seeing 2x the customers as my fellow teammates, my numbers skyrocketed despite the percentages remaining reasonable albeit ahead. I have prior sales experiences which was why I was successful to begin with. Then, witb no warning whatsoever, I was placed on unpaid administrative leave while the company investigated my sales tactics, I wasn't asked to give any statements or elaborations and after the ""administrative leave"" the company completely ghosted me. I never got any resolution whatsoever. This job is, in my opinion, extremely volatile and I strongly recommend against working here as you can be terminated either for not making enough sales, or apparently, making too many."

The overall culture is amazing and it is overall a fun place to work.,They pride themselves on diversity but everyone starts looking the same once we get Sr Manager level. They stress integrity but we had sexual harassment scandals. The layoffs and paying on the lower end of the market don’t help

Asurion,1.0,"Sep 17, 2023",Don’t waste your time working here,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",,"The only pro for this job is that the commission is uncapped, which helps make pay checks a little bigger","Asurion lied when onboarding you, and gives a sign on bonus to entrap yoh for a year or it has to be paid back. I joined the company to grow my technical skills in repair and was also made out ti believe that they covered/do full tuition reimbursement. While there is tuition reimbursement it is the biggest pain to even get and they only cover 2k a school year. Upper management is miserable, if you don’t get at LEAST one homeplus a day you have to have an “adapt” where they basically smack you in the wrist and say to get a sale, but yet when you ask for help to strengthen sales you get met with “well did you offer?”. Mind you, when I was being onboarded by my recruiter sales were made out to be OPTIONAL and never did she communicate that sales are the ONLY metric they care about. Just to make things better, we don’t have actual “sick time off” and in order to accrue ONE DAY of PTO you have to work 1 month straight (you earn 2 hrs of pto per pay check). Avoid working here at all costs. Intrusive company who doesn’t care about you as a person."

Asurion,1.0,"Nov 15, 2023",RUN,Field Service Technician,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Minneapolis, MN",• You get a degree of autonomy and self-direction on the road and during service calls • Mileage reimbursement (sort-of) • Perks for good performance and/or meeting quotas,"• Soooooo many middle-managers delivering conflicting info • Required use of personal vehicle • Online ""trading"" : 50,000 video modules that, and I'm sorry but it's true, you HAVE to skip or cheat at least a little to complete them all in the allotted time. You can't catch up by watching them outside of paid training hours, either. • The training seems to assume that you're a sociopath who has to be taught how to talk to people normally and feel emotions like empathy, interest, or compassion. • Like working for your high school yearbook committee (Ever felt motivated by that really enthusiastic and upbeat Cool Aid drinker who's doing a poor job of disguising their contempt for you by pantomiming a genial manner of discourse whilst sounding like a patronizing space-alien? Me either!)"

A decent amount of freedom","Using your own vehicle (you do get mileage reimbursement)
You deal with a lot of angry customers. 
You’re micromanaged if you’re not a top performer. 
Strict call out policy. (Overly strict) 
PTO takes forever to accrue especially in your first two years. 
If you ask for a day off they automatically pull any PTO you have even if you don’t want to use it.
No room for growth no matter how much they tell you there is."
Asurion,3.0,"Oct 14, 2023",Way Too Sales Driven,Tech Support Representative,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Tennessee City, TN",The money was really good. 19/hr+bonuses from sales.,"The company doesn’t care about you actually helping the customers, they just want you to get the sales. There’s gonna be 1-1 coaching soften and you’re never gonna talk about how to satisfy the customer or anything like that, they’re gonna show you your sales metric and carry on about ways you can get more sales when you can only convince someone only but so many times to buy a product.. I started sugarcoating the product to get more sales(was bringing in no less than 6 a day, which is beyond great) and I was congratulated yet told that I wasn’t being truthful with the customers and it could cost me. Very aggravating job. They also throw in a little future goals talk to make you feel like you can move up with the company, but you ain’t moving no where fr. At least not for another 6+ years."
Asurion,4.0,"Jun 14, 2023",I am happy with my employment.,Technical Support Representative,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"Great people, reasonably understanding and flexible with schedule, decent pay rate and benefits. I work 100% remotely which is my preference, my team's home base is in a different city/state than where I live. Monthly performance based bonuses. Abundant incentives and employee groups to join. I do not perform any sales in my current role.","Lack of interdepartmental communication is the biggest issue I experience affecting my ability to do my job. I wish we were able to get a cost of living pay adjustment, the company provided a market adjustment in 2020. I have previously suggested opening the opportunity to request unpaid time off. One of my greatest concerns is a lack of remote opportunities to advance my career within Asurion, also I am unable to travel with my work away from my physical home address due to the client restrictions."
