Benefits - get worse every year, smoke and mirrors, sleight of hand.   At a couple months away from 5 years of service earning an additional week of vacation the policy changes.  To get back to that same level of vacation now requires 10 years of service.   The extra week of vacation employees would have earned has been repackaged as sick days.  Those with the 5+  year tenure keep the extra weeks vacation AND  have sick days available.  We could care less about the sick days, those are for people that may abuse time off.

Earlier management was so dependable that if you trust them and give them time, they would never let you down.

Not the whole culture is screwed. I had a manager who was fighting with me on a scrum call and trying to push me to accept that the ""primary key is not unique"". When I used to discuss time and space complexity, he used to ask me why are you helping others with the interview questions.

None,"They put people through stack ranking in the yearly appraisal process. It's very in-human. They compare architects with 1 and 2 year people and create what they call stack ranks for a given organization. Obviously the senior people come high in the rank. New people end up being low in the rank because they are less critical to business. Then from that stack rank, they put bottom 15% in PIP. Doesn't matter whether they are bad or not. Then they subject them to in-human torture where they force people to resign through their PIP process. If you are joining this company, do ask HR about the appraisal process and stack rank. Ask them to show the published process on how they employee stack ranking and what rating they give. This is something which is not documented anywhere but they follow. This stack ranking they don't talk about it openly but it is part of their work culture. The managers knows about it but they don't tell their employees on stack ranking and why someone have gone into PIP. It is nothing to do with their performance but their biased way of doing stack ranking and in-human work culture."

I want to divide this into 3 main categories

1. Culture : This is one of the most important thing I like about NICE. It has vibrant, open and inclusive culture. Be a getting opportunity to try new things, express yourself, respect to each other , openness or politics-free environment, you will never regret being here.
Particularly for my BU, we have Sports days planned throughout year, many cultural events, Coffee with senior directors and offsite every quarter for manager happens without fail. Truly this is something differentiates and bring excitements when we work here.

2. Personal Growth: I have seen rewards and recognition are given for deserving candidates. Everybody is measured by same scale and processes are transparent. There are most people coming from Product companies who has rich experience and you get to learn from them. Increments are above market standards. In NICE, I have not see company firing anyone other than non-performers even in Covid or in slow job markets. So job stability is there.

3. Professional Growth: There are various groups and initiatives for every role and specialization. Be it devOps, Front end, even managers and directors. I have seen very few companies who ran comprehensive 6 month external training programs to managers and directors. This investment shows in skills of people.",CTC structure could have been better.
NICE,5.0,"Nov 24, 2023",A Workplace That Blends Professional Growth with Fun and Continuous Improvement!,Tech Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Pune,"Work Culture [5/5]: The work culture at NICE is a testament to the company's dedication to creating an environment where every employee can thrive. The leadership team specially in WEM actively promotes a positive and inclusive atmosphere, It's not just about completing tasks; it's about enjoying the journey together.

Fun at Work (5/5): At NICE, the mantra is 'no work without fun.' The company understands the importance of a positive and enjoyable work environment. From team-building activities to exciting sports days, there's always something happening to break the routine and create a lively atmosphere.

Regular Leadership Coffee Meets (5/5): One of the unique aspects of working at NICE is the regular coffee meets with leadership. This open and informal setting allows employees to engage with leadership, share ideas, and gain valuable insights. It's a fantastic initiative that promotes transparency and a strong sense of community within the organization.

Training Opportunities (5/5): NICE places a strong emphasis on continuous learning, offering high-quality training programs at all levels. Whether you're a newcomer or a seasoned professional, there are ample opportunities to enhance your skills and stay updated on industry trends.","No cons as such, NICE Ltd is on a trajectory of success, marked by a dedication to continuous improvement.

Zero micromanagement (on my team at least)
Leading CCaaS solution - CXone","Unfortunately, if you don’t have existing accounts, and if it’s all white space, unless you’re lucky enough the accounts you have are adversary’s. Far too many sales people with few accounts. If you’re in the Premier group, you’re golden. National group, you’re screwed. 90% of my accounts have been worked over for years and are not B2C markets (target market for CXone is B2C). I have a great team & manager. Just real crappy accounts and I’m hearing this from other areas of the business like Key. Premier has so many accounts and oppy’s. Zero Inclusivity every team has entirely diff rules pitting reps against each other. This is a “product run company” not a “sales organization”. So much lack of ownership. Layoffs they try to hide (just had a decent trimming one rep per team let go). Base pay is alright but not when you factor in the healthcare costs/benefits and no RSU’s. RSU’s go to leadership. Makes zero sense. Lack of support. Just a poorly run company overall. Takes a week at times to complete a quote in COQ. There’s almost a million SKU’s from all other LOB’s NICE has acquired. And never cleaned up. They over complicated the messaging and product offering. The company is its own worst enemy. Deawn out, complex sales process. 80% of new business comes from existing base. Unless you have that^ you’ll be set up for failure day one. Also, the SE’s are the own the sales process. It’s completely out of my control. As a seasoned tech seller I’ve never not been able to conduct customer demo’s. It’s bizarre. So once you do that you have to always bring in your SE and many other people from other parts of the company. I swear I spend at least 10 hours a week just getting schedules done internally for customer calls. There are better sales options out there that aren’t as expensive to work for."

NICE,1.0,"Dec 17, 2023",Concerns About Work Culture and Management at NICE UK,Senior Specialist,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","London, England","None, The Only Positive side is the Office is located in central London and near to the station.","I have been working at NICE UK for 8 years, and I feel compelled to share my experiences.

Senior Management and Micromanagement: The senior management approach often feels micromanaged, impacting work-life balance. Requests for leaves often go unapproved, adding to the stress.

Employee Turnover: There's a noticeable high turnover rate. Many colleagues have been terminated, placed in Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs), or felt pressured into resigning, creating an unstable work environment.

Workload: The workload is extremely high. Often, one engineer is expected to handle the responsibilities that would realistically require multiple people, leading to burnout.

HR Practices: In my experience, the HR team appears more aligned with management than employee welfare. This has led to a lack of trust in HR's ability to impartially address employee concerns.

Compensation and Benefits: There have been no increments, bonuses, or financial growth opportunities, which is demotivating and not in line with industry standards.

Office Attendance Policy: The policy mandating office attendance feels rigid, especially as the HR team themselves do not adhere to it consistently. Disciplinary emails for non-compliance add to the stress.

Contractual Obligations: The terms of the employment contract feel overly restrictive, including clauses that require repayment of bonuses upon resignation, which seems unfair.

Lack of Transparency: There is a notable lack of transparency in decision-making processes, which affects trust and morale.

Career Growth: Opportunities for professional growth and advancement seem limited, impacting long-term career development.

While these are my personal experiences and observations, I hope they provide insight for potential employees and a perspective for the company to consider for improvement."

Under the visionary guidance of our leadership team, the company forms clear long term and short term strategic vision and communicates it well with the organization. NICE has fostered a culture of innovation and technological advancement that sets it apart in the industry. Company wide events like Sparkathon, TechFest etc. give a great platform to its employees to express their creativity and innovation.

The commitment of NICE to employee growth is truly commendable. The leadership actively supports professional development, providing opportunities for skill enhancement and career progression. The employees also get a good exposure to work on cutting edge technology. This investment in the workforce has significantly contributed to my own professional growth as well. NICE also appreciates the contributions of its employees in the form of rewards and recognitions.

Moreover, the vibrant work culture at NICE is a testament to the emphasis placed on employee well-being. Regular fun events not only foster a positive and collaborative atmosphere but also contribute to a sense of community within the organization. Events like Sports Days, Bash, festival celebrations, quiz, riddles, Marathons etc. are some of the examples. The senior leadership is also very approachable and even have connect meets from time to time with the employees.

In summary, NICE is not just a workplace; it's a dynamic environment where strong leadership, innovation, and employee development and engagement converge to create a truly exceptional professional experience. I am proud to be a part of this organization, and I look forward to contributing to its continued success.","Well, there aren't much Cons that I can think of in general.
