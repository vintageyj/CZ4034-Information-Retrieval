Iron Mountain,5.0,"Feb 23, 2024","Great company, great pay, solid customer base, ample sales opportunities",Enterprise Account Executive,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Austin, TX","Lots of great supportive people who are more customer focused than other tech giants I have worked for. The offer I accepted was higher than I had expected for my experience level (Around $100k base / $100k comm for Enterprise AE role with 10 yrs B2B exp.). Lots of selling tools, a dedicated CSM (vital to your success), a shared SDR, and a shared SME for each major product category. Customers generally like us, are easy to engage with and accept meeting requests. Competitive offerings with lots to upsell within accounts across other departments and LOBs.. The products are competitive and sufficiently suited for customers' needs,","It can be easy to get stuck in discussions about legacy paper-based services that customers know Iron Mountain for (offsite records storage and doc shredding are their bread and butter). While there is a big opportunity for converting these legacy customers to digital services, Iron Mountain has most room to grow in it's cloud, digitization, and digital storage businesses. Nearly all sales are generated within existing customers who have large offsite storage accounts already, by forming relationships with the right people to find new projects, expansions, and renewal upsells. Frequent account team changes and annual rep reassignments seem to have the most damaging impact to these relationships. Rarely are deals won from a position of clear product superiority or lowest price, but rather from trusted relationships with the customer's AE and account team."

They work really well with each other and with outsiders. I could easily ask anyone for help and I can easily give anyone constructive criticism.,"The technology department rules the roost, upper management loves to talk about design first, but they will not back it. Dev will take over and make poor decisions to hit deadlines instead of making a good experience for the users. This has been happening over multiple years and we lose potential clients because of it. We also desperately need a business analysts that can create requirements."

Our Matterhorn growth and transformation story is awe-inspiring and to be able to be even one sentence of one page of one chapter of that growth story makes me feel like I'm having an immense impact. Not to mention the Head of Executive Search and the Head of Talent Acquisition are 2 of the best bosses I've had in my 20+ year career.

If you are looking for a great place to work, when people respect each other, they value their team members and appreciate talent. This is the place for you. The senior mgmt clearly communicates throughout the organization, there is a sense of camaraderie and belonging for all employees. It has a diverse group of people from around the world and everyone's opinions matter at Iron Mountain. I feel like you can get heard and everyone is fighting to win customers - working towards presenting our best foot forward. Customer comes first and I love that everyone's always working to make this a better place to work.","Like all companies there are always things that can be a hinderance in your work like the company is too big and sometimes takes long to get things approved or done, sometimes there are too many people involved or you don't know whom to go to for a resolution in IT. But that comes with any big organization. I also think budgets get shifted, but that is also normal elsewhere. I think working with awesome people overrides all these issues that probably exist in every company. I'd pick great culture over these cons."

Iron Mountain,1.0,"Dec 18, 2023",Constant Layoffs and Lies,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,"Sterling, VA","Average Benefits
Yearly raises
Nothing really stands out, the yearly raises aren't even really a benefit due to the tremendously high recent turnover and layoffs.","Executives consistently mispresent the truth and hide critical information from employees. In an organizational meeting, one of the executives accidentally said ""When are we telling them we are moving"" (or along those lines) which prompted a lot of backpedaling and lies until they came clean that they were planning a major move across state and hiding that information until the last minute to prevent workers the ability to look for new jobs. 
Constant layoffs negatively affect the operational efficiency. Employees are consistently overworked and reprimanded. 
The organization ties bonuses to revenue/profit but which is a negative since they will claim a year was not profitable even though they spent 975 million acquiring a company then another 250 million acquiring a second. How is an organization that is spending nearly 1.25 billion acquiring their competition unprofitable and why are bonuses affected by that?"

Iron Mountain,1.0,"Dec 27, 2023",American Company with full of Indians,Senior Product Manager,"Former Employee, more than 8 years",,"$80 commuter credit per month
OK pay package","I recently had the experience of working for a company based in Boston, MA, with the Engineering team located in Tampa, FL, and another significant presence in India, encompassing various levels from management to Engineering leads.

During my tenure, I observed some challenges in the organizational culture and communication, which I believe could be improved. Notably, I found the decision-making process regarding layoffs to be unclear. Despite receiving a high performance review (4.0 out of 4.0), I was unexpectedly laid off. This coincided with the company hiring new team members, which raised some questions for me about the criteria used for these decisions.

For those considering employment with this company, I would advise paying close attention to the company culture and communication practices during the interview process. It's crucial to ensure that the environment aligns with your professional values and expectations for a supportive and transparent workplace."

I guarantee they will lose their jobs soon enough. CEO only cares about making his millions. He has ruined this company by buying out other companies to gain the monopoly. As an employee they literally work you to death and will keep adding more and more work.

My advice is to avoid this man. He will ruin your career and not give a damn. Many others in the company are equally as bad so you'll always need to be on guard.

They treat people like trash. They will get rid of you before you reach one year so they donâ€™t have to pay benefits. If you are male you can do whatever you like. Females are treated like slaves. Sit down, shut up, do your work, donâ€™t ask questions especially ones that makes the manager look bad, she will find a way to punish you. Donâ€™t be absent, you will be punished. Canâ€™t state enough DO NOT APPLY!!!"

Iron Mountain,5.0,"Dec 28, 2022",Awesome Company to work for!!!!,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","Dallas, TX","Having been at Iron Mountain for over 22 years, I have enjoyed working for this company and value the relationships I have made here. Iron Mountain values their employees/staff. They know that a happy employee is a steadfast employee that will work hard for the company and the brand. I enjoy all the perks being a Mountaineer has provided me and my family. From the great benefits for Healthcare, vision, dental to all the wonderful opportunities for saving on College for my kids, 401K for my future, and many perks to save on auto/home insurance and many, many others.","The only con that I have to offer is that many positions with the new landscape are now work remotely, and the challenge to that is you are never off or away from your computer/work. Me personally, I don't mind that and it helps me keep up, however that can be a con if you are not use to that, or havent worked remotely before."
Iron Mountain,5.0,"Apr 12, 2023",Ambitious,Manager,Current Employee,,"This is an ambitious and innovative company with a vast array of service offerings all over the world which makes it quite unique and interesting to work for. There is always something new to learn, challenge to accept, or problem to solve. It is very inclusive and always trying to expand and evolve.",With the ambition comes the increase in stress to meet goals for both sales and operations. The organization grew quickly with many acquisitions and currently has challenges with streamlining communication and ensuring all parts of the organization are aligned. Process improvements are underway but I anticipate it will be 2-3 years before this is better for the overall organization.

I took my time to make sure it was done correctly and they just let me go. No warning, NOTHING. So much for caring. Never again."
