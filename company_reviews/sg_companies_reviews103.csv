Stripe,4.0,"Jun 4, 2021","Overworked, very little diversity in eng org, but hopefully big pay off",Software Engineer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","New York, NY","The work is very high impact and there are lots of opportunities to learn if you're not already familiar with the fintech space. Most of the big projects I've been on so far have been fun to work on. There are also a lot of talented, kind, and helpful engineers at Stripe who are really nice to learn from. I really enjoy my manager and the folks on my team. The money + bonuses are ~ok~. Pretty standard for a pre-IPO unicorn, but the goal is that there will be a big pay off later (fingers crossed).","- The work life balance is *bad*. For how many products Stripe has, we are a very lean company. Too lean. There's just a lot of work, and very very tight deadlines, very fast paced, and not enough engineers and product managers to do all of it. If you want WLB as an engineer, join an infrastructure team, not a product team. 

- There is little to no investment in making the engineering org more diverse. This was surprising to me because of a lot of public facing company statements, but don't be fooled like I was. People (at least in the eng org) do not care about diversity. 

- HR sucks. And of course they would, I guess. But I had a really negative experience with HR where I walked away feeling completely devalued and gaslit.

- Dev environments kinda suck and make the work a lot slower than it should be."
Stripe,4.0,"Jan 16, 2024","Great company, be prepared to work really hard",Partnerships,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"Stripe is full of highly intelligent and motivated people. They have excellent hiring processes which means you're surrounded by the best and brightest. In turn this has led to them developing excellent products. They also have an inspiring vision to fundamentally change how payments happen, and in turn delivering more value to businesses.","60+ hours a week are normal at Stripe. Their view is it's a race and they want to win.

The main challenge I saw while working there was the company strategy & bets constantly changed (except core payments). It's important to pivot and be flexible, but the frequency with which Stripe did this means a lot of wasted effort planning and re-planning. 

The founders are exceptional but some of the other leadership hires weren't great, hence a regular rotation at the L team."

Company is wide open to hearing new ideas for growth. People hired by Stripe are intelligent, so it's a good place to learn and grow.","Cringy indoctrination process (onboarding includes various group training sessions that open like motivational seminars led by wide-eyed hipster types who say things like ""alright Stripes, who's hyped to talk about infosec??"" over a soundtrack of dated, light EDM tracks). Watch any Tony Robbins intro for an example.
They like to talk a big game about work/life balance, but peers don't support each other and it's toxically competitive; even people with nothing to gain from undermining you might stab you in the back, which means you spend a lot of time watching your back instead of doing your work. 
Bad management on various levels, the worst being: management struggles to provide clarity around orgs' true goals and tends to fall back on threatening vs coaching other managers. Middle managers are overburdened and don't have time to focus on the people management aspects of their roles. 
Don't get me started on the sappy branded playlists, of which there are many."

It's a sad situation and nobody in the upper management seems to care about it. Why? I think everyone is afraid of being let go by either Patrick or John Collison. That can happen on a whim. Not to mention the recent 1000+ people being laid off.","Initially upon joining, you may see a ton of Pros and whatnot, but eventually the Pros turn into Cons + the insane workload and expectations from everyone in the product teams. I've spoken to multiple engineers in other Stripe product teams (than my own) and everyone agrees - the expectations are too high while the CEO Patrick and co-CEO John (I'm not sure what to call him) are nowhere near as overworked as us and it's apparent that they don't put as much as effort as the technical teams. Why? I'm not sure why. Maybe because they think they've already ""made it"" to the big bucks and they can rule and be rude with the low-profile engineers in the company? I've never expected this kind of treatment of people in Stripe. Never. While in public Patrick and John Collison run a narrative of being the good guys, behind the doors, well, they are clearly NOT. It's frustrating and exhausting. I've seen too many of my colleagues getting overworked and frustrated with the instability of decisions from both of the CEOs."
Stripe,4.0,"Aug 16, 2023",Great place to work - your mileage may vary across teams.,Staff Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Boston, MA","There are intelligent people everywhere. They care more about developer experience and friction than many other engineering shops. There are many good problems to solve, and the teams are well-positioned to execute their goals, with mostly adequate resources. Company values and culture are genuine, positive, and largely non-political among the engineering ranks. Many people are not too cynical and believe in personal growth, which leads to a culture of continuous learning and improvement, promotions, and development. The pay and benefits are competitive.",Tech Stack is a mess - you might not work with the best tools in the industry as the company struggles to maintain the codebase and introduce a modern stack.

Even then it was kind of looked down upon to have those boundaries. - Most managers would email/ping on evenings or weekends. - The upper management was absolutely horrific and completely out-of-touch. Managers were encouraged to not give employees ""meets or exceeds"" expectations, and instead often encouraged to manage people out. - Very little transparency and no time/resources given to ""huge"" and ""important P0"" projects.

* Job expectations are extremely vague and seem to be left that way on purpose
* Appear to be doing broad layoffs in preparation for IPO and likely to be able to hire in lower-pay employees, so make sure compensation seems worth it if you are given an offer
* Removed unlimited vacation
* Expectation that you self-teach skills not listed in your hiring responsibilities in order to ""level up,"" minimal to no training offerings in those areas.

Stripe,2.0,"Sep 11, 2023","Great product market fit, poor executive leadership",Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,Great product market fit and demand from customers. Strong name brand recognition and progress in gaining enterprise customers.,"The closer you get to the exec leadership team, the closer it feels like a middle school popularity contest. Highly political game of who is the favorite of the founders - favorites get significant power. They showing up on all-team calls driving strategy and taking over others’ teams where they have no experience; until they fall out of favor and new favorites are bolstered up. Lots of untrue backstabbing, the higher you engage, the more toxic it gets. Poor product discipline is slowing down enterprise adoption."
Stripe,2.0,"Sep 27, 2023",Hiring and leadership need significant changes,GTM,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"Great level of autonomy, really great community of employees, pretty good benefits. People are generally very reasonable, nice, and empathetic, everyone seems to realize we're all in the same boat. I had 3 different mgrs in 2 years, but my last one was great and did what he could for me with the resources he had. I loved my teammates.","Going to just give a smattering in no particular order: - There's a culture of quasi-toxic positivity: What I mean is that ""everyone's idea is important and no one shouldn't follow through with their ideas"" tends to be the prevailing sentiment. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of good ideas out there and because Stripe tends to hire very bright people its even more the case, but that doesn't mean there's time, resources, or the ability to prioritize, those ideas. It translates into a bunch of people doing what they think is important, or multiple people doing the same thing they both think is important. - Thinking big to a fault: instead of addressing and resolving the baseline systems, processes, policies, etc. the business overall seems keep going after huge ""sexy"" and shiny things. As a result the business blunders along and everyone's basically building a house of cards because we've yet to address the aforementioned fundamentals. - Hiring: I personally found (and I say this having probably benefited from it) that they hire people largely based on where they went to school (you see a lot of harvard, yale, columbia, cornell, etc.) or if they worked at a FAANG. Sure these schools and companies have great people but that doesn't inherently translate into a good fit for the role or company. In addition I found they tend to favor external hires over internal, prioritizing the same thing I just mentioned. The hiring process is also wildly protracted; they make people jump through so many hoops and in the end are not very rigorous on decision making e.g. I was on one interview loop where despite interviewing 2 candidates I was never involved in the discussion on whether to hire or not. The issues with hiring are a real problem as they'll quickly balloon into bigger issues e.g. your top existing talent getting becoming resentful, apathetic of jaded, or a bunch of smart people that think they're above or aren't willing to do the grunt work. Last point is semi related where I found that they hired WAY overqualified people for pretty unsophisticated roles, e.g. a role that would've been a good fit for a 3-4 years experience biz analyst type background they hire someone with 10+ years of experience in sr. analyst experience. Those hires end up either feeling like they were sold a false bill of goods or just get bored and leave - saw it many times. - Ownership: tends to be a lack of ownership, which I myself was guilty of. There's no strong sense of ownership so you'll go to teams for help on something and everyone will point to someone else or say its not their responsibility. I was guilty of doing the same thing, primarily because I was able to and everyone else was, so why not. This lead to it being really hard to get anything productive done and eventually to me just giving up trying. - Compensation: Personally I found the compensation to be subpar (I won't lie, I was willing to accept it in the hopes, like I suspect many others were, of equity growth). This was evidenced in the fact that I took a pay cut to join, and got a huge (>30%) pay increase when I left. Equity comp was lack luster at best, as was getting worse when I left. Salary and bonus okay. The compensation change communications were opaque, if communicated at all. Separately it took me 5 months of back/forth with the compensation team to have them correct an error (they admitted it was an error in the end) in my compensation. - Leadership: I found a general vibe of a lot of mid to sr. leaders having this vibe or air of superiority and entitlement. I felt like many had this idea of when they came into the job they'd get big ol' teams that they could boss around and then just be a talking head rather than actually getting their hands dirty. That just translated into a lot of the stuff I mentioned above happening, e.g. people just doing whatever they wanted and nothing critical getting done unless sh*t was hitting the fan. Beyond this I think exec and C level leadership are also part of the problem. Its easy to pin things on the people at the middle or the bottom, but ultimately the buck stops with the top. If its happening down below its because the top enables and allows it. - No career opportunity: may have been because I wasn't based in the US but I found zero opportunity for career growth. I did get promoted (though I think I accepted a lower starting level than I should've), but aside from that I had a mgr hired above me, and found no other opportunities."

Stripe,2.0,"Apr 3, 2023",Just work harder,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,- Good compensation - Generous equity package - Benefits - Friendly and supportive colleagues,"- The company's lack of focus and direction means new priorities are constantly added. Few are ever removed. Teams are expected to work harder to deliver on all of them. - The inability to prioritize is prevalent at all levels. Example: employee performance is evaluated against 16 operating principles (plus 7 oldies but goldies that Stripe just couldn't let go of). So, as an employee you have 23 different principles and slogans you need to consider for how to do the myriad of tasks that are thrust upon you. 
- Staff turnover was high even before the layoffs in Nov 2022. Whoever is left is expected to pick up the slack when people leave. Open positions are rarely backfilled these days. You just have to work harder. Burnouts are common. 
- If you're in one of the smaller offices or remote, don't expect Stripe to follow local labor laws when it comes to working hours, overtime, vacation etc. If you bring this up with HR, you are likely to be dismissed with a blanket statement about global policy."

The vision and rollout of some new product areas are slightly ambitious and choppy, but Stripe continues to be fairly successful despite tech limitations and competing against behemoth payment companies.","Personally found the leadership to be unsupportive and you are very much on your own to solve problems. In certain segments, there is a lack of mutual ownership despite lots of resources focused on a customers. Tons of turnover have contributed to this and continual hiring has exacerbated this. Lastly, the comp plan was impossible to understand compared to other tech leaders. It was unclear whether you were hitting targets and bonuses were very much based on management discretion. The base salary was competitive, but the targets and accelerators were challenging to achieve."

- A special equity bonus program was rolled out to the whole company except sales people. Why? We just heard it's ""too complicated"" to set this up for sales people who are on variable commissions. 
- You don't get paid on new products you sell. Stripe launches new products all the time. Even though you're expected to learn, promote, and sell these products, you won't get paid until the comp team gets around to figuring this out which could take 6 months or longer.
- Very little support offered to closers. AEs are expected to do a lot of their own prospecting. The outbound org is still very undeveloped. 
- Same goes for post-signed support. No clean breaks. Even if you attach a support package to your deal, you'll find yourself continuing to work with that company well after you close the deal.
- You spend less time selling and more time working in tickets given the complexity of deals at Stripe.
- Really bad sales incentives compared to other high growth sales organizations. Lengthy commission cycles that lack transparency, little to no spiffs (the few I've seen are paltry), although we did just get accelerators! Hell will freeze over before Stripe offers a Prez Club. The equity bonus program mentioned above was the biggest slap in the face."
