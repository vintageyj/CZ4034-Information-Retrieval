Civica,5.0,"Nov 28, 2023","Wonderful Work-Life Balance, great team",Software Developer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"I've been working for Civica (US) remotely for a little over a year, and I'm beyond satisfied with everything they have provided me. My personal life has been complicated enough, and my manager has been happy to accommodate me every time I've asked him for something. The willingness of my manager to listen to my situation and accommodate my needs has been a refreshing experience compared to my past work experience. We get a monthly, sometimes weekly video update from Lee Perkins, the CEO, who updates us on the stuff going on around Civica, and it makes me feel connected with the Civica workforce even though I live far away from everyone at the company.","I guess the job is a bit underpaid compared to similar jobs at my experience level, but personally due to their willingness to let me work remotely, and their flexibility when I need to take a few hours off for things like doctor visits and family errands makes me more than happy even with the monetary loss. Vacation time is also slightly lower than bigger companies, but you won't have to take vacation time for a 2 hour doctor visit, so it evens out."

There's too much oversight for common place things like paying vendors: It shouldn't take four to five months to pay less than $200. Or six months after the project for contractors to get paid.

Civica,4.0,"Feb 9, 2018",Potential to be great,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,"The employees at Civica CMI treat each other as a family. They celebrate with you when you're happy and offer great support in times of strife. The 401K matching is very generous. Civica has an agile environment; if appropriate for your position and duties, you may opt to work from home with approval from your manager. The CEO is enacting forward-thinking changes to the structure, organization and processes to position the company as an industry leader in municipal software. The office atmosphere is fairly laid back, and the workforce in general has a good sense of humor. Persons who hire in at entry-level positions have many opportunities to move into higher positions (and many  have done so within a year or two of being hired). The CEO is very tolerant of dogs and will, on occasion, allow someone to bring a pet in for a short time. This company is extremely patriotic, and greatly supports and appreciates military service. Many staff members are veterans and their service is celebrated. Certain positions within the company are compensated very well and above industry standards.  This company values diversity. They value college degrees, but also recognize industry experience can sometimes be as valuable as a post-secondary education. The company invests in workforce development by providing corporate training seminars. As a part of a global corporation, employees have opportunities to not only learn about, but potentially visit or be transferred to new countries.","The medical benefits are pricey compared to other similarly-sized companies. There is a lack of autonomy for anyone who is not in senior management or a sales rep. Processing time for normal tasks is slow (i.e., the company is run very democratically in that all senior managers must approve ideas, procedures or projects and it complicates and sometimes halts progress). When being hired, you are sold on a vision of what the company can be. The reality is that the company does not yet reflect what their vision is, although they are taking dramatic steps to make their vision a reality. As a result of this, newly hired employees sometimes feel as though they've been promised things that rarely (if ever) pan out. Many employees work many more than 40 hours per week due to the company having previously been run as ""reactive"" versus ""proactive"". While the company is no longer run this way, current employees are still feeling the effects and paying the price for leadership decisions that were made a over a decade ago.  A small portion of the employee base earns salaries that are 10-25% below industry averages."

For the 3rd time in under 12 months our team are facing another brutal round of redundancies from a leadership team I’m still not sure actually know what our products do or what our colleagues deliver for this company every single day.

We continue to make money for the company and deliver for our customers but that doesn’t seem to be enough. So we continue to outsource key business functions to India and fire good quality/loyal staff in pursuit of an extra sliver of profit.

It’s honestly hard to turn up for work day in and day out when you know your efforts aren’t valued or recognised, and that your years of hard work to build the business can be minimised in a heartbeat by leadership who have been here for barely two minutes."

We had a ‘record breaking’ year apparently with a big well done off the CEO .. then a below inflation pay rise across the board. In the last 18 months there’s been 2 rounds of redundancies, a management restructure and a sell off. Nobody feels safe anymore in the uk, work is being hived off to India. Many capable experienced staff have left. Morale is zero, nobody wants to work for Civica , there is no goodwill left. The CEO may be a plant by our competitors. From an employee point of view in the uk he couldn’t have made us feel any worse. The day he announced ‘great news’ for Civica being bought out, about 40 staff were having their redundancy confirmed.

In turn this puts pressure on projects to deliver under tighter conditions ultimately ending with overly stressed staff. Sales people still receive their bonus despite poor sales . 

Staff are under paid yet expected to over perform . You can earn more with less responsibility at other organisations which in turn provides a healthy work life balance .

No-one feels like they have any job security now and we’re constantly expecting more cuts. Any jobs that can be moved to India are being, presumably because it’s cheaper. It’s great being able to work from home but local offices around the country have been closed over the last couple of years meaning that unless you live close to one of the hubs you feel very isolated.

I believe new c suite have good intentions but comms from them seems to miss and deflect from the cons - addressing how we are going to change for the better.,Morale has gone down the drain. We say our culture is what sets us apart when there is no culture anymore - most people work from home. Staff with the experience and knowledge don’t want to engage with new starters/early careers because of this. That’s why everyone’s leaving. There are webinars and affinity groups but no one wants to spend most of their working day on calls with customers to then join another call to ‘socialise’ with team or get involved in wider initiatives. Working relationships are very superficial because of this. And managers don’t care. Those that do work from home are treated inferior to those able to go into offices in terms of access to opportunities and promotion. Talking about pay is effectively red taped and people (managers) don’t like it.

Morale is rock bottom and the remaining team have either lost interest, jumping ship or planning to if things don’t improve. There is a recruitment freeze which means positions for people leaving won’t be backfilled and their replacements up to speed until long after they’re actually required.

Everything now going to India where possible, UK based staff are almost an ‘afterthought’ these days as company only interested in getting as many jobs offshore as possible so they can pay the staff peanuts. 

Software gets ridiculed by end users but management only worried about adding more features that don’t work, rather than trying to fix what is already there.

I perform a specialised job, and have a first class degree from a top university, and working for Civica has ruined my confidence in my aptitude. I have received seven years of outstanding appraisals, which have not been rewarded in any tangible way. In the seven years I have worked here, my salary has increased by less than £5,000. The upper management of the company waxes lyrical about the consistent topping of the last year's profits, but this isn't seen by those of us overworked on the ground. 

I, and some of my senior colleagues have petitioned to management for my promotion, but because I have been willing to speak out on the iniquities we face, I have been persona non grata with senior management for a while now. Colleagues who joined at a junior level to me in other departments regularly have starting salaries of £7,000 more than I am currently on - and that is after me giving seven years to the company. With the recent cost-of-living crisis, I had to apply for Universal Credit because my salary is so abysmal - in a specialised job, this, to me, is absolutely unforgivable. When I spoke to one of the senior management team about this, I received the following rebuttal: ""well, not all of us have noticed the cost-of-living crisis, especially as I haven't got a mortgage anymore"". For me for a couple of months last year, it was choosing between paying my rent and eating, and those higher up the chain haven't even noticed the difficulty the rest of us we have been having. My rent went up by 20%, but I have received a real-terms pay cut for the past three years.

Yet again we are going through another round of restructuring with associated redundancies (5th in 8 years I think). Each time we're assured this is it, this will set us up for the future, no more of your colleagues will be lost... then 12-18 months later it starts all over again. The business cannot function if it keeps losing its most experienced and talented employees. Our customers are losing patience. It's gotten to a point where it's clear the business just wants to reduce costs so it can pay higher dividends to its shareholders; it does not care that those who are left are having to work harder under more challenging conditions to try to prop the business up. It appears the business's main desire is to slash UK staff to a bare minimum in favour of cheaper staff costs in India... just be honest about it."

Aloof senior management, together with HR (sorry ""People Team"") have handled recent redundancies terribly.

All work is going to Vadodara in India.

Salary increases (if not frozen) were 3% for our team, not great when inflation has been closer to 10% - and this when the company boasts about record profits.

What used to be an amazing place to work, has declined to a point where pretty much everyone is unhappy. The recent restructure has been shambolic. No proper change management, no way to feed back inaccuracies, constant arguing with Senior Management to get things right. Unfair treatment to hard working staff and to top it all off, hit the sales people in the pocket - make their targets unachievable and their commission lower than ever before whilst micro managing them to within an inch of their lives (next steps, tasks - if you know you know!) 
What must our customers think of us?? I don't even know what I am doing, how do our customers interact with that? Totally goes against this ridiculous mantra of ""GovTech Champion"" that is spouted on a daily basis by the SLT and CEO. How are we the champions? Staff are ridiculously overworked and underpaid, the software is a shambles, customers are charged phenomenal rates and all anyone is bothered about is where is the next PO/licence fee/service booking is coming from. Its all so short-sighted.
I have no idea how they have recruited into the business recently. The comments on Glass Door say it all. If you are reading this, give Civica a swerve right now.

Quality of produced work worsens because employees are being asked to deliver more and more month by month, year by year. There is a toxic culture of token offerings such as mental health champions, assistance programme and diversity etc however in reality fundamentally top management don't allow anyone to have a bad day, or to struggle.

- Offices are clean..

The amount of inaccuracy in proposed job roles, errors to reporting lines and errors in job titles is a clear example of a poorly executed and rushed plan, actioned by leadership who don't understand the nuances of the business. 
- Restructure: No attempt was or has be made to listen to the views of those staying. Teams were left to discuss and fill in the many blanks amongst themselves. 

- Sales: Allowing so many to wait so long to understand their targets and commission structures doesn't seem fair, especially after making so much change (cross product, region focus)

- Support: Is being stripped to the bone. The aim is to be ""Gov Tech Champions"" but this is going to be done by delivering on a shoestring. 

- Product: the aim to cutback to only work on revenue generating development won't work in a SaaS business. Products need to be serviced and maintained. 

- Services: the constant aim to turn a 35% to 70% utilisation overnight is unrealistic. It is now helping the wellbeing of staff to keep hammering at this. 

- Dev: the team in India are good. But the needs from a gdpr / data management perspective means the balance/ratios being targeted seems shortsighted.
