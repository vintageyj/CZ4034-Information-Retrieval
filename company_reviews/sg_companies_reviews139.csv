You can choose if you want to work from home or the office, and the offices are always top notch. Very smart people are working in Criteo and it’s nice to be part of it.","As the C-levels are super professional and smart, the intermediate and lower levels of leadership are SO bad. If you need anything which is a bit out of the box for your clients, no one will give you a hand or answers. In my team we had a 30 minute weekly team meeting plus 30 minutes of one-to-one with the team leader and that’s it, if you need anything else the managers will give you the feeling that you are nudging them and wasting their time.
Growing within the company is almost impossible, both horizontally and vertically. There is an inner company system for career development but the fact is that it’s impossible to grow because so many positions were switched to temporary internships contracts, kicking out the permanent staff in order to bring a cheap workforce to be changed every 6-9 months."

I would rate this company lower if I could.","The sales team quite honestly feels like a Highschool. The managers are not trained for their positions, they are in the positions because they joined Criteo at a time when Criteo prospered and “proved” themselves when all it took was spamming clients into oblivion. They do not know how to offer advice, they will only look out for themselves, and have on many occasions said things that should have been cause for HR reprimands. But hey, that’s just sales. This job causes undue stress and they will encourage you to work overtime and will reward the most nonsensical luck as if it were proven strategy. There are better jobs out there but if you’re in a pinch the benefits are great and the pay is decent. The name isn’t too bad on a resume either"

I spent 5years there, learning new things everyday. The company culture is the same you may find in a small startup : everyone helping each other, everything is made to make you feel you’re unique. I learnt a lot! Your colleague are passionate by their job and you’ll share lot of great conversations.

Today, I was laid off from Criteo. In a five minute digital meeting with my boss, she informed me that my position was eliminated (“a reduction in force, decision not reflective of my performance, return your laptop in 30 days, etc.”), and then she left the meeting so that the HR Manager could provide the logistics of my unplanned departure. The end.

This is not my first time being laid off. It is, however, the first time that a lay off felt impersonal. As I was signing my digital paperwork, my boss shot over to me a message via Slack, saying, “So sorry. Best of luck!” No messages from the leaders or the team. Four individual colleagues reached out to share their sadness, appreciation and best wishes before my systems access was shut off. That’s all. I truly feel like a number who was erased. What happened to the relationships that I had established? Did I mean nothing to them? Any appreciation? Did I achieve anything? It feels like a year of my life wasted. 

If this is the Future of Work, I don’t want it."

Used to be a caring, friendly company with lots of talent and very nice initiatives for employee wellbeing.

When I learned what the OTE was, I explained that # is what I was looking for my base alone.... Which is fine! There was a disconnect and it's better to get these things out early in the interview process rather than later. The recruiters response was "" well good luck with that. I don't see that anywhere out there at all"". Continued to be smug about what I said. Apparently this person knows all of the media advertising space! What an absolute pleasure to speak on the phone with someone so knowledgeable and professional. Next time, just say ""At that price point, I'd suggest to keep your eye open for a more senior role here"". What an embarrassment. I could cringe writing this, but he spoke like I haven't been making that $$ as a base for the last 3 years....It was a disconnect for sure, but know how to speak to people."

Yes, the benefits are decent - as they are at any tech company. The company is trying to reinvent itself but its highest margin product (retargeting) has a limited shelf life and continues to decline, which then impacts the overall environment.","What is absolutely grating is the gap between talk and action on diversity. Yes, there is talk of diversity and programs and so on. But where it counts - leadership and upper management, there is no diversity. From C level down to VP level, at least as far as the US is concerned, you will be hard pressed to see a black or brown face. Yes, there are plenty of women - all caucasian.
