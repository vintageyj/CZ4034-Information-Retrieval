In my group retention is amazing. I am given a lot of opportunity to make my own decisions and execute for my stakeholders.","While relatively a large company, NetApp is not a large company in the IT space. I’m not convinced it’s a place you can advance easily. In my time at NetApp, the company leadership has made some poor strategic decisions that caused our competitors to take advantage. The same leadership team is still in charge with another strategy shift which is still TBD in its effectiveness"

NetApp,2.0,"Feb 14, 2024","Lots of hype, little substance",Manager,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","San Jose, CA",The only good thing about NetApp is its CEO. The people below him however are mostly very biased individuals who are only interested in building their own kingdoms and using the company as a stepping stone to something better. All of the greatest leaders at NetApp have long since left the company. Most in frustration and dissatisfaction for not being able to affect the real change that is sorely needed.,None of what they talk about is true when you're in the trenches.

I wouldn't change my time at NetApp, the relationships I made last to this day.","NetApp is lost, like a lot of legacy hardware storage providers trying to navigate a cloud connected world. Their value prop is murky and they are a commodity in a saturated market. 
Why am I writing a post 3 yrs removed from the company.....this company lost their integrity and this line NetApp opens with when they post a job, is not genuine and is insulting, ""We’re forward-thinking technology people with heart.""
Does a company with heart, eliminate your position while you are undergoing cancer treatment? Apparently in NetApp's eye's their definition of heart does include such behavior....disgusting! The definition of Heart for NetApp means kick people aside when they are there most vulnerable.
I understand a catchy marketing slogan, but can a marketing team be that out of touch with the culture and reality of their own company? Apparently yes.
If you are considering a job at NetApp, spend some time doing research, look up Tom Mendoza speaking on culture, David Hitz on what NetApp was when he felt his kid was old enough to embark on new challenges. Reach out to past NetApp employees on LinkedIn to understand the company you don’t see in their hiring ads. 
Ask insightful questions based on your research and most importantly understand why after so many rounds of layoffs that have impacted 1000’s, that this company is worth trusting your livelihood and the wellbeing of you and your family? 
The people I know and love still at NetApp are looking over their shoulders waiting for the next axe to drop. All biding their time for the job market to pick up, so they can run away from this NetApp’s “Heart”."
NetApp,3.0,"Oct 10, 2023",High highs and low lows,Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Denver, CO","- Nice benefits - Fairly competitive pay - Good WLB - Tech stack is mostly up to date Had lots of flexibility here and was mostly happy with my day to day work. Was never too demanding and was able to maintain a life outside of work very easily. Management was flexible with vacation time and sometimes granted extra vacay time for getting big projects out the door. Not a lot of legacy tech, feels like we stayed up with industry standards","- Constant churn, very chaotic - No vision or direction - Unstable (layoffs frequently) - Minimal R&D - Bad management - Huge communication gaps in organization I worked on 4 different products in the 5 years that I was at NetApp. Management was constantly ripping the rug out from us and moving us to the hot new product. Could be really jarring at times especially after getting comfortable with something new. Layoffs happened 3 times while I was there, I was effected as well (severance is solid though fwiw). Company is surviving off legacy products and rolling the dice every 2 years or so on 10+ different product lines to see if something lands (usually with no success). Long story short, it's a good paying easy role with solid WLB. But career growth is difficult here and the work is really chaotic."

NetApp,1.0,"Mar 25, 2023",Watch out!,Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Boulder, CO","A paycheck every couple of weeks. Based on your luck, you might actually work with a certain good folk.","I worked at NetApp for a few years and it was one of the worst work experiences I have ever had. The company's frequent layoffs and workforce reductions made it a place of constant instability and fear, where employees were more concerned about their own job security than working together to achieve shared goals. In such a toxic work environment, employees tended to backstab each other, spreading rumors and sabotaging each other's work to gain an edge in the constant competition for job security. This further eroded morale and made it almost impossible to build a sense of team spirit. The frequent layoffs also led to a lack of continuity and stability, with projects being started and then abruptly abandoned, or teams being restructured and reshuffled every few months. This made it difficult to get any meaningful work done, and employees were constantly worried about whether their jobs would still be there the next day. Overall, NetApp is a company that seems to prioritize short-term profits over the well-being and development of its employees. The constant layoffs and workforce reductions create a culture of fear and mistrust, where employees are more likely to backstab each other than collaborate to achieve shared goals. I would strongly caution anyone considering employment at NetApp to think twice and carefully evaluate the company's track record with layoffs before making a decision"

Internal communication from the C suite as a whole is the best of any company I’ve worked for in my 30 years of experience.","To be blunt, NetApp cannot get out of its own way.

NetApp,5.0,"Jan 31, 2022",Great place to work if you want to be customer focused,Solution Architect,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Houston, TX","I am a Solution Architect that prefers to be customer-focused, and I absolutely love working for this company. I am armed with data and with plenty of resources to call-upon when trying to help my customer's design their solutions. I don't have to be the master of everything on-premises and in-the-cloud, but when I call on those resources to help me out, there is an expectation that I will stick with them and use the opportunity to learn. It isn't just about us selling stuff, but I feel like I get a chance to grow every day in my job.","Over the last two years we have had a lot of development of products, and also a lot of acquisitions. Unfortunately with COVID, we have moved our annual Insight Conference virtual, which makes it really hard to truly learn the new stuff we are doing. Sure, I can speak to it, but I am not as competent to get online and actually build out a customer's CVO instance like I can do with their traditional on-premises flash array / SSD systems. I think it is a curse across all of the IT industry, but we do need a chance to just ""stop"" the selling motion and get in and get our hands dirty with some in-person training."
