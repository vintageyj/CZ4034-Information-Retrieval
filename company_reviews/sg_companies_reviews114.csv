Good benefits 
Good opportunity to interact with people globally","Tunnel vision by upper management. Each one has different objectives, many times in direct opposition to sister business units.  Objectives tied to annual bonus leads to a focus on product release, with little regard for readiness. 
Much lip service to company values and transparency, but no improvements have been seen. People are not encouraged to be open with opinions and honest in town hall meetings. Upper managers try to control the message and focus on keeping the lower levels from discussing issues of great importance. Speaking to HR in the past has been useless as HR was always biased and not willing to truly listen. With change in staff, there is hope this will change.   Very little opportunity to actually meet and talk to our customers, this is a privilege kept for very few. And those few greatly abuse travel opportunities.  Customer conferences have stopped, leading to more distance between Sita staff and the customers they do all possible to help improve business bottom line."
SITA,4.0,"Nov 23, 2014",Great place to work but US market is mature,Head Business Development,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Charlotte, NC","SITA is a key player in the Air Transport Industry, this is an very technically broad environment that offers a variety of challenges.  They are an innovator in some key areas but are not fully leveraging their capabilities.  They offer a good work-life balance, and decent opportunities (though these may be influenced by geographical region).  Management is supportive but focused more intently on foreign markets, at least at the point in time (2010) that I left the company.","The Air Transport Industry is evolving and in recent years the growth has been in off-shore emerging markets in contrast to North America which is a rather mature market.

SITA,3.0,"Feb 22, 2021","Some pros, some cons",Account Manager,Current Employee,,"I'm really proud of and impressed by how well SITA management has taken care of its people during the pandemic. They've exhausted many efforts to avoid mass layoffs and pay cuts. They've been mostly understanding of how tough of a selling environment it is right now given how decimated the industry is. Other pros include great benefits, flexible schedules, used to be cool events and liberty to travel pre-pandemic, some really great people to work with (also some not great people). I will also give SITA credit for trying to make certain shortcomings better (but oftentimes it's too bureaucratic to follow through).","SITA is an old legacy company that often rests on its long-standing reputation and relationships with airlines. As a salesperson, this gets you in the door, but then when it boils down to the technology it can and should be much stronger. Oftentimes the only way you can be successful in sales is to have one of the biggest airport or airline accounts. Sales is really hard here. Pricing and proposal processes are unnecessarily difficult to the point where sometimes I'm scared to put together a pricing proposal, it's such a headache. Also SITA's portfolio is so gigantic that salespeople can't specialize in any one area and are spread very thin."
SITA,1.0,"Jul 13, 2020",Please be careful in the US if on a visa,Software Developer,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",,"SITA has some great teams and technologies to work with. It tries to adapt to the latest technologies and new ways to make customer travel easy especially during these COVID times.
The benefits it provides are good too.
There is work-life balance.
Great company to work with if you are a citizen.","If you are not a US citizen and are on a visa, then you might have a difficult time getting help from the immigration team. The process is very slow and there is no guarantee that you will get help on time. Unfortunately, there is only one person handling the immigration for both US and Canada.
Especially if you on F1 student visa, I'd be more careful because there is a high chance of not receiving the documents needed to submit to college on time or not receive them at all. 
Since being on a visa, we run against time, it is important to get responses and help in time. It is important to be transparent with the process and what is happening especially during these COVID times. 
It is not fair to put employees in a limbo about their status and wait until their work authorization expires and then terminate eventually."

Because they sell only to a segment of the market, their products can be focused and competitors easily known.  The company's roots were a cooperative type of organizational structure to the airlines in the late 1940's where they developed and implemented their international network infrastructure.  Today, they recognize that they are a viable business and need to operate like one.","Because of their origin, SITA struggles to be able to turn the company into an agile, lean run company.  They talk about where they want to go and hire consultants to help them get their, but they just can't seem to turn the corner because they are not willing to make drastic changes, starting with many of the people who have been there for a long time.

Voyager is a disaster, though management says it delivered ""on time and on budget"", which was a bald faced lie. The new finance system is a disaster, with no good data available to help manage the business.  No career opportunities for those inside.  Few to no raises. They reorg every year, as a way to wallpaper over the lack of business performance and issues within the businesses. But they never follow through on the reorganizations to make the current organization effective, before they reorg again.  So over the last 6-7 years, the company has become progressively less effective. And morale is absolutely horrible.  Either the CEO is blind to the problems, or there is a very effective filter of all issues that keeps him from being aware (which is cultivated by the fact that he is very volatile and loses his temper with his senior team a lot).  This company absolutely WILL go out of business if it continues on the current path."
SITA,4.0,"May 26, 2015",A good company overall,Lead Software Developer,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","Atlanta, GA","The company truly values the people who work there, and will work hard to help you advance your career with them. There is a very low turnover rate, I'd say 10 years is about the medium tenure for the professional staff, at the upper levels 25~30 years or more is common.
A surprising number of people who do leave return after a few years. Periodically they have hiring freezes, despite the open listings on the career page.","The company moves at it's own pace, and HR is no exception. Don't be surprised if things go quiet for several weeks before you get an offer, just keep in touch with HR to make sure is on track. Once you do get in, you will find that the low turnover means few opportunities to advance in your local team. The trick to getting promoted is to move laterally into a different department or division, and this is supported and encouraged by HR and management."

Changing the culture of a company is an incredibly daunting and often painful task"

That has prepared the company for doing well in the future.,"Unfortunately, since SITA is in the airline business, it is being impacted by the slowdown in the aviation business due to people not flying as much (because of Covid-19). Having said that, the company has NOT laid anyone off and is doing everything it can to get through this tough time. Also, they are dealing with the crisis very well and doing an excellent job of communicating with everyone in the company about what is going on.

NOTE: The ratings for Career Opportunities and Six Month Outlook reflect this current (temporary) Covid-19 condition that is out of the company's control (but which they are handling well so far)."
SITA,4.0,"Dec 16, 2010",Overall a great company. But watch your back.,Service Delivery Manager,Current Employee,"Houston, TX","Good benefits (even though they were becoming more and more exp) 
Matching funds on 401k up to 6%
Ample vacation time.
Laid back management relationship first name basis with sr level directors vp's etc.","Sales tends to promise first and ask questions later placing delivery people in difficult positions with the customers, which is then blamed on the delivery staff. 
Customer satisfaction reviews are often confusing to  customers with multiple lines of business.
You need to watch your back when working with some members of the Sales and management staff, when they are done patting you on the back and telling you how they are on your side, make sure they didn't leave a kick me sign there."
SITA,5.0,"Jan 21, 2017",Manager,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","Atlanta, GA","If one can survive the announced layoffs that are coming up (Jan-Mar, 2017) and one can stomach knowing they work for a company that drastically reduced its severance package policy AFTER making the announcement, then things should be pretty good although very, very busy since there is always a huge amount of work and now there will be less people to do it.  There was a reduction of 300 (out of 4500+) that was just announced (Jan 2017) but they also mentioned moving an undetermined number of roles to 'lower cost' areas over time which most people would interpret as there being less jobs in Atlanta and more in India.

In addition to the new CEO who apparently has done this before (e.g. come in and layoff people), our part of the company also has a new VP that reports to a new VP (which is not uncommon... contrbuter>manager>director>VP>VP>CEO).  This was also something that the new CEO indicate was needed: flattening.  I have never worked at a company that 80+ VPs (although I imagine that number will be reduced fairly soon).

Given that the company is not doing anywhere near as well as the big three GDS' who dominate the market (Amadeus, Sabre, Travelport), none of this is surprising.  It will suck for those who get laid off (which may include yours truly) and it will be stressful for those that are left, but long-term it should be a good thing.

The company is actually a great place to work and the people are extremely knowledgeable about the airline industry and its customer needs.  However, personally, for those thinking about coming here, I would wait until the dust settles and then see how the re-org is working out (stayed tuned here as I am sure the survivors will be able to share more afterwards).

PROS

Great people
Great airline industry knowledge","Certain high-priced horribly run projects that led us to where we are.

Silos around the world and redundancies of certain solutions.

Change of severance policy right before laying off 100's of workers (legal but perceived as unethical and unfair by most (including those who think they will remain)).

Certain people (and pockets of people) have a 9 to 4 mentality which is probably another reason we are in the boat we are in.

Certain people (and pockets of people) have to go the extra mile (and do) to make up for the previously mentioned people which is probably why the need for layoffs didn't happen sooner."
SITA,1.0,"Mar 31, 2016",Terrible place to work,Analyst,Former Employee,"Atlanta, GA","Sita has good benefits - medical, dental, 401K, and covered parking","Sita has more people managing, and few people working- so nothing gets done correctly. Managers seem to be on a mission to discredit employees - even when they are good workers. This is to help them have a bell curve during review time. HR always supports management 100%. The quality of products that we sell to customers, always have problems. No one knows how to solve the problem because they are pointing their finger at someone else. Believe this happens because there is a separation of work-groups. No one is allowed to know what the other groups do. Therefore there are only a few people at Sita that can see the big picture. It is hard to trouble shoot or even function when you only know a small piece of the puzzle."

Management staff does nothing and is not involved where they need to be. There is no direction and tasks change every day depending on what the higher ups are screaming about today. There is also 0 communication between teams and many abandoned projects due to mismanagement and lack of communication.

I cherish every minute I was there contributing to SITA success, and continue to wish SITA every success in this very challenging global marketplace.","Picture this-first day of annual Sales Kickoff, the new CEO,  acquired from SNCF, stands in front of all the Sales and Product leaders in attendance, and says she is laying off over 300 people right away, in a company of barely over 4000 globally.
A reorganization which then drags on for months, while every employee is left wondering who is next? In N. America, SITA reduced the maximum severance by 6 months, in advance of letting people go. So much for loyalty to employees.
SITA frequently struggles to remain relevant to the ATI customer demands, being too late to market in far too many instances, and then confused over why SITA sales get stagnant. Far more insidious is the deep silo mindset, with blame going everywhere,except to senior leadership, when Customers demand to get what they have paid for.  downsizing, reorganizing of work centers, hiring new, younger faces, with outsourcing is seen as the new solution to everything.

I get along with the people I work with.","About 50% of the management staff are email forwarders,  told to me by a senior manager, and boy does it show.

They can't seem to get any qualified managers.
Ex: 
There is a woman working near me as a QA manager. She is a contractor who was promised full time at 6 months. Her SITA manager left, and they hired someone else to fill that role. Turns out the person in that role had already delegated ALL of their work to the contractor. So, SITA never actually needed that position. They filled it anyways. The person they filled it with has done nothing for 6 months now. Has shown no interest in doing anything. The contractor lady is STILL doing all the work... and now 1 and1/2 years in she is still a contractor. So they demoralized the contractor, and they are paying a 100k+ salary out for no reason.

Talk about being good at destroying the morale of productive employees.

----

They don't seem to have ANY idea at all how to manage technical workers or projects. The company has been doing  Agile for 2 years now, but management didn't take Agile training, and are STILL trying to run things by giving priority to whomever screams the loudest, and STILL want to operate under a waterfall style overall.

EX:
The project manager who is supposed to be prioritizing our work still cannot read our agile board or run reports on their own. After a year, and a lot of effort on our part. They need to be spoon fed everything. This manager, still doesn't seem to understand that the job is to prioritize our work. There are sites all over the world competing for our time. There is always a lot more work than we can do, and this person can't seem to figure out how to choose who comes first. This manager just asks them what they want, and then tells us. 

EX:
We deliver software early in the year, and they don't test it until late in the year, then they all lose their minds, and need everything fixed immediately, so they can get credit for delivering on their contracts, and we can get paid. This manager cannot figure out how to MANAGE that and get the sites to test the software when they get it.

There are LOTS of other examples of waste, inefficiency, and incompetence in management."
