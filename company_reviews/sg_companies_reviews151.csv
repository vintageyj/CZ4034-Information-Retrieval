Smart, knowledgeable engineers that you can learn a lot from and are very personable and supportive. Challenging daily but every employee can see their own personal value within the organization. The company promotes a healthy lifestyle and encourages social events outside the office as building relationships are essential","Lack of communication & support within all levels of management. Work-Life Balance was nonexistent and results in burn out of good employees. Career advancement & recognition based more on your likability by upper management vs job performance or merit. Lack of training and support internally is counter productive and frustrating.  Gossip & Negative personal opinions (aka perceptions/assumptions, even without merit) outweighs job performance. People need to remember that they are expected to act professional and negative opinions based on assumptions impact livelihoods, respect each other.  Not all are held to the same accountability and need additional training in retaliation/bullying in the workplace."
Rohde & Schwarz,4.0,"Nov 29, 2011","Wonderful company, making great strides here in the US",Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,"Columbia, MD","R&S cares about its employees and it is reflected in the cut backs from a couple of years ago where they cut everyone (and I mean everyone) pay by 10%. Not only were we able to get our 10% back, but we got our bonuses too. During that entire time, when other companies were trying to save money by cutting benefits, R&S elected to keep the benefits and 401K contributions the same. They were able to keep a strong and talented workforce.","Working for a German owned company half a world away is always a problem. Not only does the language prevent strong communication, but culture does too. For a company that has been around for more than 80 years you would think they would have worked out the communication issues. When departments won't talk, many efforts are duplicated. Many people have been making great strides in resolving this with new software tools, but people need to use the tools and that is where the problem lies. It's not that the ""company' won't communicate with its employees, its the employees that can't seem to make the effort to communicate."
Rohde & Schwarz,1.0,"Dec 1, 2017",Management,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Burbank, CA","Nice environment north of Burbank, CA.","No leadership and training to get you up to speed to learn the systems, completely out of touch with clients because for some reasons these clients are always wrong.  Meeting with customers and understand their need is in no way part of the job, support is done only via the web and visits is not supported by management. Upper management is only worried about the 9 to 5 position the rest is up to sale to develop their business. Nothing is worse than an office that is completely empty and each employee fight and curse in each other desks, at 5 PM nobody can be found, the employees escape the building without saying anything. This is the worst environment to work in, more than once I had to go outside to speak to a customer because the cursing was out of control. The boss doesn't manage this type of situations and doesn't care what so ever about relationships and how to promote the brand to new customers. The support calls are in no way professional, there is a lot of we love you, once they hang up then it is nothing but the F.. Word. Sales are hated and pushed outside the office with hatred remarks."
Rohde & Schwarz,3.0,"Jul 14, 2011",On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it a 6.,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,"Columbia, MD",Decent pay and benefits. Interesting products.  90% of the employees are friendly people who work hard.  Secure facility. Convenient area to commute to.,Lack of communication between departments.  Lack of clear marketing goals that incorporate flexibility. There's a need to branch out for new avenues such as social media.  There's also a need for a revamped HR department.

A nice team which you can trust and rely on. Workhours are normal and the company provides good benefits.,The boss either likes you or doesn't and that is decided in the first 30 minutes. He didn't like me which made build up some tension. I couldn't work for I was paid for and I got tasks assigned which should be done by youngsters. Boss was very smart to avoid anything in a written form which could provide some proof. A handful of coworkers resigned at the same time because they couldn't bear it anymore.
Rohde & Schwarz,2.0,"May 11, 2016",Politics over technology,Hardware Development Engineer,Current Employee,"Beaverton, OR",Good benefits.  Access to leading edge technologies.  State of the art test equipment design meticulously for ultra low noise high end performance.,Many mid level managers are more focused on maintaining and growing their personal power than advancing technology.  Nepotism is rampant.  I regularly saw good designs killed in favor of poorer designs done by the managers friends.  Mid level managers just cover up designs that fail or blame their political enemies. The isolation between Beaverton and Munich allows mid level managers god-like power.

Medical, dental, vision, Rx, life insurance all 100% pd for by the company.  And the coverages on all of the insurances is very good as well.","Inconsistency between managers, People that are not managers like to act like they are and treat people like they are their boss when they really are NOT.  One person will tell you one way to do something and the next will tell you a different way, and there is NO communication between them therefore causing annimosity amongst the staff"

I have never worked for a Company like Rohde & Schwarz before. They seem to care about the workers and the families of their workers. They are imperfect for sure (read my Cons below) but one could do a whole lot worse than Rohde & Schwarz. I would love to give this review a 5 star, but because of the significant frustrations listed below, I can give only a 3 star.","I enjoy working here for the above reasons. But, as with any organization, there is room for improvement. The Cons listed here are from one person's point-of-view. I work in a support role (read non-sales, non-service technician role) and am frequently overlooked. I'm pretty burned out and am staying here simply because there isn't anywhere to go (yet). I still do my job with dedication and passion (that is how I have always tried t work) but because of the Cons lited below, I am entertaining offers to leave Rohde & Schwarz. So, in no particular order, the Cons as I see it at Rohde & Schwarz at Corporate HQ (I will update this review if things significantly change before I leave the company).

- Advancement is slow to non-existent

- Some managers ""protect"" certain employees

-Staffing in support functions is inadequate (non-sales related)

- Burn-out becoming more common - good employees looking elsewhere to further career since the promotion come only to a select few 

- Recognition doesn't follow achievement - it follows self-promotion

- If you area conscientious, hard-working employee, you will be exploited. You will have more work than you ever imagined piled on you. 

- Work-life balance very difficult to impossible to maintain"
