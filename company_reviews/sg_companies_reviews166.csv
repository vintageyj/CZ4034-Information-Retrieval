They help foster your development goals while ensuring you exceed your objectives. Team members are supportive and understanding as you get up-to-speed learning the organization and the industry. Tons of flexibility too, while they encourage work/life balance. 

Additional benefits:
- Department Executives want to hear from team members as recurring skip-level conversations take place throughout the year.
- Summer Hours - Work some extra time Mon - Thurs and get Friday afternoons off!
- Opportunity to work anywhere in the world on a temporary basis, I believe the time limit is 30 days.
- Sabbatical opportunity after a certain duration with the company.","The organization has gone through many changes so you have to be flexible and adaptable as all of the processes may not be well defined. You also need to be prepared that there are personal changes due to the ""great resignation"", as well as reorganizations.

2. Very unfriendly to foreign employees. 
H1b: lawyer response email WITHOUT any time manner, and immigration HR never response my direct message or email, which result in a lot of REF H1b cases.
GreenCard: When join the company, both HR and manager said after 6 month we can start the GC process, but then they start to find different kinds of excuses to delay the case. Then 4 years later, that's when my H1b has less than 2 years left, they said they can start my process, but I need to sign an agreement saying: if during the whole process, if I left Here, I need to pay all expense for my case.
3. Bad benefits, beside base salary and basic insurance, no other benefits at all. There is even a cut of 5% of your salary since pandemic happen and they are laying off 5% of people now.

Unethical leadership at Director and Executive level - willing to hurt and stress employees in the name of ""getting the job done"". Even if it's a poorly done job.

My line manager is the best","Poor benefits; premiums for medical go way up every year, dental is subpar, DTO vacation plan is a disaster (previously Paid Time Off-PTO was better). Some managers don't want to let you go on vacation, Bonuses are nearly nonexistent, raises are a joke-get the highest review possible and you may get a 2% increase if you are lucky, no career path, poor internal training-you are on your own, Europe and India have better benefits than Chicago and don't get laid off at the rate Chicago employees do, as layoffs always start in the USA.

Quarterly layoffs and reorganizations indicate that the Leadership Team (LT) keeps trying things that don't work. Somehow, people manage to get their jobs done in spite of this.

The LT conducted a focus team for the survey with the intent to get more good survey responses. The focus team was told at the outset not to bother evaluating any questions that were LT related, just make suggestions for what people at our level could do to help. Management also had a shadow team who the original focus team was unaware of, that filtered the suggestions made so not to offend the LT. 

Upper level executives keep disappearing from the company, but the ones who need to go are still there at the highest levels. 

The car consortium who owns the company had promised not to interfere in our daily operations when they bought the company, but they are always interferring. I have heard in meetings many times that we have to stop what we are doing and work on something for one of the owners.

 Getting promoted from within is nearly impossible. Make sure if you accept a job here, you get the salary you want and you are hired in at the level you want to be at 5 years from now. Then at the end of 5 years, you may be ok."
