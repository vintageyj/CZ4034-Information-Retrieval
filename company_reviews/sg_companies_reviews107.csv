Shopify,3.0,"Dec 16, 2023","Fantastic Developer Experience, Fell Short of Expectations in most other Areas",Senior Development Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Austin, TX","Fantastic Developer Experience. The Tools that developers get to use were fantastic. Shipping code to Production daily was empowering. 

Compensation was fantastic after the move to Flex Comp. You are able to chose more cash or more equity based on your individual financial goals and needs.

Shop team Burst was excellent.","No opportunity for growth on team. Manager took all the Staff Eng level work for himself and farmed out tasks to his developers. 

Stock was almost immediately devalued by the market before I joined but after I signed an offer. 60% decrease in value that was not made up when I started. 

Joined with the expectation that I was to report to a specific manager, offer letter even stated that fact, then was forced to report to someone with substantially less management experience. I ended up regretting not standing up for myself.

Tobi and his exec team operate as a god-like boys club - they do what they want at the expense of the emotional and psychological safety of their employees, e.g., Chaos Monkey at the start of 2023. 

Similarly, the company has no moral standards, hard-right racist and homophobic conservative shops were allowed to stay on platform including sites like Breitbart."
Shopify,3.0,"Jan 24, 2024",Stressful ,Sr merchant success manager ,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Denver, CO","Good comp plan, learned a lot, Shopify on your resume gets noticed and can open doors, great benefits!","Management was not overly supportive, comp plan changed multiple times over the 2 years I was there. The role and KPI's were constantly changing. Executive Leadership was very out of touch with the CX and didn't seem to care much. Mid level leadership seemed very overwhelmed and overworked and therefore didn't offer much value. It was challenging at best to get support for Merchant problems - get technical teams to jump on calls and discuss solutions with Merchants. Everything we did was in Google Drive, including all our KPI tracking. It was incredibly difficult to have these enormous Google sheets you had to sort though to know how you were doing with goals and performance."
Shopify,3.0,"Sep 19, 2023",It was great - until it wasn't,Senior Product Designer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"Truly some amazing people; great perks like expensing house cleaning, discounts with Autonomous; generally flexible scheduling; some managers are encouraging and provide helpful feedback","Once there was a mass exodus of tenured Shopifolk, things went downhill quickly. Some senior management seem to be lackeys for a mercurial C-suite, constant restructuring, little stability in teams. During my brief tenure there were at least 3-4 reorgs, seemingly done on a whim. Very little authentic communication between leadership and their teams - in the dark about why changes happen and when they might be coming down the pike - and teams and individuals suffer for it. The company overhired in big ways and compensated with multiple mass layoffs and firing people just before they vested. Multiple people were fired or left after taking medical leave just on my individual team (never a good sign for team health). Expectations for roles were unclear and individuals were easily thrown under the bus by toxic upper management to look good for their bosses. The overall environment was chaotic and lacked stability. Would not recommend unless you're looking for constant change and anxiety about whether you'll still have a job tomorrow."

Case-and-point, he acquires a fulfillment company for 2.1 billion dollars, only to sell it for 1.1 billion dollars 10 months later. This is not an example of sane or prudent decision making. I understand that successful acquisitions are rare but I've never seen an acquisition given up on or resold less than a year later. Such whimsical decision making does not happen with people who know how to run companies. - Senior leadership outright lies. Case-and-point, in Feb 2023, the president of Shopify states that no more layoffs will happen. Then 3 months later a 20% layoff occurs. Even the most senior leaders of a company cannot guarantee, under all circumstances, that layoffs will not occur. So don't bother saying that they won't occur in major business news publications. This is an example of why you shouldn't take what leadership says at face value. - Depending on where you are in the organization, you may find yourself on project where you have to deliver features, quality be damned. You may or may not be okay with this approach to software development. - Internal processes and communication tools change with no realized benefit. On the contrary, there have been net negative benefits of some changes. - Attempts at fostering a trusting culture are laughable."

He's a smart guy and obviously is the main reason why Shopify is as successful as it is today, but he's now surrounded himself with ex-Silicon Valley ""yes sir"" type leaders who are completely disconnected with what's going on at the ground level. - Anyone who's worked at Shopify over a year have probably experienced a ""Tobi Tornado"", where the CEO steps into a project(s) and micromanages the crap out of it and then just walks away expecting everything to fall perfectly in line. When he comes back to check-in and it's not exactly as he envisioned, all hell breaks loose: people are gaslit, blamed (yea right ""blameless culture""), and disappear from slack the next day. The CEO makes it a very toxic place to work. - Ever since the multiple layoffs, culture and morale at the company have completely gone down the crapper - it's just survival mode every day."

If you are on a team that is building the darling project of a senior leader then things will be more hectic for you.,"- A lot of red tape to get through to get any work shipped. You have to go through rounds and rounds of reviews which I understand can help ensure quality remains high. However, it discourages experimentation. - Too many ""leaders"" who have no idea what they are doing or what they want. Most are just yes men to the CEO and COO. Visions and initiatives change often because of this so its frustrating for the people building to get anything of substance done. - Adding on to my last point, reorganizations happen every 3-4 months. It made it hard to track your progress and growth as your priorities (and managers) change so often."
Shopify,3.0,"Sep 7, 2023",They're working on it,Growth Marketer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","New York, NY","Great benefits and incredibly smart talent. Working at Shopify is a fast-paced and intense learning experience. You'll likely be exposed to innovative projects, teams, and roadmaps you can't find elsewhere.","Becoming a 100-year company is a goal that comes with some friction. With two mass layoffs in a year, consistent restructuring, and reductions in spending, the efforts to increase revenue can be felt throughout the organization. You'll notice an emphasis on thriving on change, which is similar to most companies in the tech/SaaS space. In most cases, rapid change led to thrown-out roadmaps, teams unable to normalize, skipped review cycles, or smaller projects that never made it to launch. Once the post-pandemic growth dust settles, I think that thriving on change will turn back into a ""pro"". For now, it comes across as if there's a lack of top-level focus (too many drastic pivots). Advise: 1) Never stop learning; this level of knowledge is rare at a company! 2) Pay attention to company changes, specifically any benefit changes. 3) Watch for any major leadership shifts or exits."

It was the healthiest, most supportive work environment I ever worked it. The people I worked with were the smartest and most talented people I have ever worked with.","Sadly, after the first year, things went down hill fast. The culture completely changed. Management made some incredibly poor decisions with out the feedback and expertise of people on the ground doing the actual work. People became afraid and anxious while at work. There was insane amounts of burnout, and a real lack of clarity about the direction the company was going in. It felt like Shopify lost its heart."

Product was in meetings morning through night, and really unable to - The ""no wasted time in meetings"" press junket is mostly for show: our team had very little muscle for async working patterns like videos and docs. A lot of the real momentum in decision-making came from meetings. - Design can be treated as pixel pushers, often informed of features rather than asked to holistically explore a problem space.

Work-life balance is stellar, outside occasional deadline crunches. The company cares about the right things and generally does right by its people (even during layoffs).","The only two main cons of Shopify are: 1) it may not pay as well as the elite tech giants (although it still pays very well, in my opinion); and 2) there's a lot of bureaucracy. Not as bad as some companies, but there's WAY too much sending things three levels up the chain and waiting to get the inevitable swoop-and-poop from the execs, and then having to rework everything right before the deadline."

Pay was higher than what I would earn locally.","The culture presented in my onboarding is definitely at odds with decisions made at the highest levels in the past year. Everything employee-facing is rushed and released in a half-baked state. Leaders brag about making things intentionally chaotic. Mass deleting everyone's meetings, clearing out Slack channels that are actively used, introducing Meta Workplace without clear guidance, introducing new job and performance frameworks, etc. I was hired post-pandemic in a time of high growth. Within months, new hiring was frozen, 10% of the company was laid off, perks were cut, promotions were frozen, travel was restricted, and another 20% of the company was laid off.

I used to have a lot of respect for this company until I joined and experienced the chaos myself","The leadership team is incapable and full of BS. A few examples: 1. We have Slack but the new COO (Kaz) and previous head of logistics (now sold to Flexport) tried so hard to shovel Workplace by Meta down our throats. Everybody hated it but their reaction to feedbacks was ""we should thrive on changes"" and introduced more friction to Slack. 2. After the layoff mid 2022, CEO said no more layoff in the townhall after and our president repeated ""no plans for more layoffs"" Feb 2023 and then layoff again in May 3. Shopify negated on severance package and is being sued in Canada 4. During the most recent layoff, all impacted employees were terminated on the same day which was a direct violation of WARN act, which requires minimum of 60-day notice. They had no consideration for employees on visa who have 60 days after termination to find a new job or face deportation 5. Reorgs never stop.

Deleting meetings was a painful joke that cost a lot of people a lot of time and work to fix. Performance review systems got changed and new deadlines set with days of notice, completely side-swiping anyone who had a planned vacation.

Shopify,1.0,"Mar 26, 2023",Worst professional experience of my career,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","New York, NY",Absolutely nothing positive to say,"Working at Shopify was the worst professional experience of my career. During my time, the company went through several restructurings that created a sense of instability and uncertainty. I had a total of 5 managers during my time there, with each less and less relevant to my craft. Despite meeting the expectations of my role, I was recently let go without a clear explanation. I've noticed that Shopify has been quietly laying off employees since the last major wave in July. There seems to be a focus on people of color this time around. As someone who belongs to several protected classes, I cannot help but feel that I may have been singled out, given that other non-minority colleagues in the same role were able to remain at the company. Adding to this, a Shopify brand leader recently posted a very controversial offsite team photo on LinkedIn showing a clear lack of diversity. Over 30 people are visible in the photo, but not a single person of color can be seen. The photo was shared on Blind, and several users shared my concerns. In their comments, Shopify employees said that ""the closer you are to being a white man, the more likely you are to succeed at Shopify"" and ""Shopify is the least diverse company I have ever worked for."" These statements ring true to the core. Overall, potential employees should be aware of these issues before considering a position at the company. The lack of transparency, commitment to diversity, and apparent willingness to let talented employees go without clear justification make it a difficult and potentially risky place to work."

They don't actually solicit any feedback from peers for their feedback cycles so you could get glowing reviews for months straight then suddenly get a bad impact rating out of the blue. So much wasted time on things that shouldn't be needed. Everything is built in house so they have to spend an absurd amount of time doing simple things instead of just using frameworks or tools that have already solved the problem. Way too much hands on intervention by the CEO. It was a running joke that you couldn't get through a product review he was involved in without some product or technical change he'd insist on despite not having anywhere near enough product or technical context for it to matter. But everyone always did it because it was understood you don't say no. Made everyone sit through 4 days of meetings after the layoffs in 2022 where the executive team congratulated themselves on how good of a job they did firing 1000 people. The level of tone deafness on display was disappointing. Basically shrugged when LGBTQ employees expressed concerns about platforming obvious hate speech organizations.

If you care about having a life that is meaningful, do not work at Shopify - you won't have time or sanity left for the rest of your life. The bar for hiring no ""jerks"" has dropped, and the managers who cared about your well-being have all fled the company.

They seem to be trying to hold on to their start-up roots, but the chaos with projects, ever-changing priorities, and unrealistic expectations makes for a very toxic work environment. Managers are very immature, both in their experience and in their approach to dealing with people.

For a company that is known to underpay, I was always amazed by the level of skill we were able to onboard.","Over the last year the culture at Shopify took a steep dive. New SLT seems to forget that they are running a team of humans. A lot of unreasonable pressure and expectations are being pushed downstream while SLT is never held accountable for their choices.

The company made promises to their employees regarding compensation adjustments and proceeded to miss all of their timelines one by one without any accountability.

We're now policing public messages to make sure no one is voicing anything with any resemblance of criticism to our leadership team. While I was not at Shopify very long, I did get the impression that disagreeing with SLT or criticizing our CEO was truly something you were not allowed to do there. Ironically, it feels like the easiest way to prevent that would have been to not give people a reason to feel so passionately against the job SLT is doing."

Pretty good work-from-home culture (better when I started than when I left). The people are incredible - brilliant, dedicated, and committed to doing good work. Decent technology and you have the tools you need to do your job, for the most part. Pretty good benefits.","The number one issue that Shopify has and will continue to have is the quality, or lack of quality, in their senior leadership. The people running the company probably think of all the chaos and disruption they cause as benefits, but that's just not true. You simply cannot run a company of close to 10K employees the same way you run a small startup, no matter how much you might WANT that to be the case. Leadership talk about the Chaos Monkey all the time, but they a) misunderstand the value proposition of the original, and b) use it as an excuse to do things that are poorly planned and badly executed. Pointing out the self-inflicted wounds tends to get the argument that its just part of Shopify's culture, which seems like a bad culture. Chaos Monkey at Netflix taught engineers to build redundant, resilient systems. Chaos Monkey at Shopify teaches employees that everything they count on can be undone at the whim of an executive and with no warning. Everyone using Slack? Nope, we're all going to Facebook for Business (aka Workplace for Meta), and we wiped all the history in the public channels because ""chaos"". Not enough people using Work Facebook? We're shortening the retention period in Slack so it'll be less useful. (I'm sure the fact that the COO is from Facebook has nothing to do with the decision to move to Work Facebook.) The employees are amazing, but the senior leaders are driving the company into the ground.

I have learned that it's perfectly acceptable to have different rules for different team members and that showing favoritism is a great way to build team morale. I have also learned that integrity and honesty are overrated and that manipulating and lying are much more effective ways to achieve success. Thank you for showing me that hard work and dedication are not enough to succeed in this company, and that brown-nosing and backstabbing are the real keys to advancement. Thank you for teaching me that taking credit for others' work is a sign of strength, and that blaming others for your own mistakes is a great way to show leadership. I will miss the constant stress, the never-ending drama, and the feeling of constantly walking on eggshells. But most of all, I will miss the sense of camaraderie that comes from being part of a team that only looks out for themselves. Thank you for making my time here such a memorable experience. I will carry these valuable lessons with me wherever I go.",nothing can be considered negative by shopify's standard

Then when they get laid off they can't seem to find a job to meet the inflated title they were given. A terrible example of setting people up for career growth Management talks to you like it’s your first job when the current situation is their fault.

Zero transparency, no way of providing feedback, and they make big decisions without any discernible rationale. The way they treat their employees is just incredibly disrespectful. For example, there was a silent promo freeze that lasted 9 months. I understand why given the economy, but it was *never* acknowledged. So many people just spent months waiting and waiting, their career development stalled, without leadership ever saying one word about it. As others have mentioned, it's extremely common for Tobi to overturn many months of careful strategy on a project, based on his own whim. Managers are also insulted by the company very publicly.

The team is run by 5 white men each elected by 1 white man and it shows. It's no wonder 4 women on the team have left, and a majority of the rest are applying elsewhere. Does anything change? No. Just more workload on the suckers that stayed behind instead of instituting change on the actual problem. HR doesn't help either, trust me, we've tried. And forget about growth.

Shopify,1.0,"Dec 22, 2022","A Smile, Promises and Then What?",Senior Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","New York, NY",- The product is setting an industry standard; - There's a real need in the market; - The ecosystem is supportive of the broad mission and encompasses good companies and people.,"- Sales managers don't know how to course correct and anticipate, severely lacking accountability; - Senior management lacks focus; - The direction changes literally every quarter; - The sales culture doesn't know how to grow up from what is is - SMB order taking. There's a huge problem when a company of this size doesn't know what it wants to be for any customer that isn't SMB and can't communicate its value clearly beyond a few key talking points. That might have worked when the tide was heading perfectly in its direction, but that's not the case now. Bigger issue is for any quota carrying rep at Shopify. The managers who are directing strategy and ultimately responsible are not trying to figure out core issues, such as: TAM, territories and data integrity. This leaves reps not knowing where to hunt, what to hunt for and praying that when shakeups occur they have something to work with. The market is generally much smaller at the enterprise than management wants to believe, until there is real product market fit. That will likely take 2-5 years to sort out."

Big global company with decent support network for getting folks situated into this scale of work.","The chain of command is rather silly, and Tobi Lutke putting himself at the top as CEO and CPO while also unwavering in his role as founding engineer-in-chief is just too much. Engineering leads design systems within project parameters and fight for alignment through multiple layers of leadership, only to have Tobi take the entire project in a different direction or scrap it all together. The end result is hundreds of individual contributors being blocked for weeks at a time while waiting for their next few minutes with Tobi, and middle leadership layers being relatively powerless to provide real direction or agency. That makes for some pathetic middle leadership who may support an initiative but refuse to endorse it so the people below them have to sort it out with the people above them directly.

Less than a year later, they moved back to a global model. Then less than a year after that, they moved BACK to an N. Amer/APAC/EMEA model. - Major changes rolled out quickly with little consideration, namely compensation. The revenue organizations pay was changed with 1 month's notice from a base salary and a small bonus to an 80/20 commission split. - Biggest complaint by far is Sr. leadership takes no responsibility for their screw-ups. For example, they laid off 20% of the staff and sold off their Shopify Logistics arm (in less than a year of acquiring it) because the CEO wanted to focus on the 'main quest.' Core developers and front-line employees who work directly with merchants were laid off in droves; supporting merchants is literally the main quest. Sr. leadership took no ownership of the fact they made a horrible decision buying a logistics company and caused them to hemorrhage money so they needed to create a smaller team. - They also referred to management bloat as a reason for the layoffs, yet almost no managers were laid off.

This is by design but it can be hard for some people to get footing. Part of this chaos and the company’s willingness to make bug jumps very quickly have also caused some issues with stable employment. Recently shopify rewarded employees, after much better than expected profits for 1H 2019 to sell off a major part of its business, and reduce labor by over 20% across various parts of the company. While this made stock skyrocket, it was not good for the really valuable employees who did a lot of work to get the company where it needed to be. I get it, this something happens. Divesting yourself of unnecessary or unprofitable expenditures is the job of any CEO. This seemed like a move designed to make the company more lean so that it looks good going into the next increase in profits.

Black female staff are subject to daily microagressions and white fragility. And women on a whole are paid much less than they’re male counter parts. The performance review system is essentially a subjective biased exercise on how much your lead likes you or how much you threaten them. Friends of leads are promoted and if you challenge the fragility you are marked off track or penalised. Additionally, the leadership on a whole lack competence to lead people.
