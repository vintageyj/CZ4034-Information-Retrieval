Unity,2.0,"Feb 22, 2024",Sinking Ship Being Plundered by Corrupt Executives,Senior Product Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"Some of the most amazing people you'll ever work with.
Used to have a good culture but IronSource ruined that.","Clueless and greedy executive leadership and board whose only focus is lining their own pockets and seemingly tanking what used to be a great product and company. 

No innovation - there's no product vision or direction, just meaningless buzzwords to provide the illusion of progress while the executives plunder.

Constant pivots and re-orgs. No product vision or plan = musical chairs.

HR is almost completed automated (oh the irony) so if you have a problem, good luck.

Shrinking benefits in order to pay for grotesque executive salaries.

Racist (and generally awful) behavior from IronSource towards Muslim employees that is tolerated by management.

Employees used to be able to voice their objections and opinions but that was quickly stomped.

Constantly tanking stock value: RSUs are worthless

Completely disorganized and disjointed information management; everything has to be found in one of the thousands of Slack channels.

Constantly changing tools - over 30 internal tools, most of which are in a constant state of sunset or introduction

No annual review system or way to track metrics, progress, or goals. Management doesn't set KPIs or OKRs because everyone is always being re-org'd and priorities are always shifting.

Management is too busy peacocking at conferences and on LinkedIn to actually do their jobs."

Town Halls and All-Hands meetings are a joke - Keeps advertising itself as 'competitive' in the market yet a simple LinkedIn search reinforces the conclusion that Unity is severely underpaying its employees - Marketing organization is messy and borderline toxic in some areas

-Exceptionally poor management. Expect to be gaslit and ridiculed by your managers. Your voice doesn't even matter. Everything that was once Unity (grow side) is now ran by Iron Source and they have 0 empathy for employees.

-Poor culture. Just ask the employees that are still there how things were before Iron Source took over. It's night and day.

-Upper management doesn't even have a grasp on how the Unity product works and nobody is ever aligned with product functionalities and launches. Miscommunication across the board. 

-They keep trying to run Unity like Iron Source and apply strategies that make no sense.

-Management asks you to challenge them and when you do and they don't like your idea, you'll get skewered. They don't even want to bother with what you said. 

-Even though the interim CEO rescinded RTO, the management on the Grow side is forcing employees to come in 3x a week still. 

-During a meeting about culture, a manager literally said that since there have been so many layoffs, you now have space to come in and work wherever you want. 

- Clicky culture and a lot of 'yes man' mentality here. A lot of ego issues here.

-Unity has laid off over 2K+ people since 2022."

Unity,3.0,"May 31, 2023",It was a roller coaster ride,Technical Writer,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","San Francisco, CA","The company had outstanding benefits, gorgeous offices with all the extras, fantastic technology, and super coworkers. Unity truly walks the walk on diversity EXCEPT see my advice to management. Unity had many Employee Resource groups and seemed to truly care about issues for LGBTQ+ , about inclusion. And I saw some great promotions happen to folk from diverse groups.","Career growth can be stunted, arbitrary, and controlled by gatekeepers. Your chance of getting promoted is directly linked your luck in who happens to be your manager. It's very hard to get out of a bad manager situation and get into a new role or group with a new manager. Also they downgraded salaries if you went remote. The salary I am listing is from San Francisco."

Lots of fluffy word that seem insincere. Non-competitive salaries They just cut our wellness benefit, two days after a layoff and after we started the year and made financial commitments assuming we'd have it. Sending big impact news via emails instead of having a meeting with the employees. Executives encouraging everyone to RTO, but they are not actually showing up to the office"
Unity,5.0,"Jul 5, 2023",Great experience during entire hiring process,Senior Product Manager,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Austin, TX",Unity is a great company with really smart people and good benefits.

Unity,1.0,"May 4, 2023","Messy, disorganized, and ambiguous",Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",,"Large company, so you would think it’s stable. Compensation is fair for the work done, but most of it is stocks. Work life balance is also generous as well depending on which teams you work for and where they’re located. In general all my colleagues have been very motivated and engaged and generally want the best for the product and the company.","Layoffs after layoffs in the last six months I’ve been here. Inconsistent as well, some layoffs have rehoming which means they were well thought out, but some didn’t. Inefficient decisions: I know of at least one position removed due to redundancy and then rehired. Internally there’s no real processes so efficiency was low."

Minimal meetings/micromanagement; I’m trusted to own my own book of business which feels good.","Restructuring this year; ambiguity on headcount. Some may struggle with this, but be ready to recruit for *anything* (you’ll support whatever the business needs at that time); need to be okay with being pushed to source/recruit on new profiles constantly; some learning curves Internal cross-functional processes could be improved between HR/finance/recruitment."

It is just the nature of the beast! The company is massive with tons of products. I wouldn't really call this a con but just something to be aware of. Over time you will become more familiar with it all but at first it will be a tad bit frustrating.
Unity,1.0,"May 4, 2023",Run the other way - you can do better elsewhere,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,Beautiful offices. Really good mental health benefits.,"Antiquated out of touch thinking from Leadership. C Suite has run this company into the ground worshipping on the altar of quarterly earnings. Third round of layoffs in a year with no impact on the bottom line. Layoffs were automated through emails. If an affected employee wanted to talk with a human being, they have to fill out a request form. Severance was pitiful from what I’ve been told. The “values” are a joke particularly the oft cited “in it together” which should be reframed to “in it for myself”. Benefits are cut, RTO is being forced starting September, offices closed."
Unity,1.0,"Jun 12, 2023",Going public sent company down a different path.,Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,"San Francisco, CA",Some of the employees and engineers are amazing. Some of the incredible talent that made Unity what it is are still there.,"As a long long time Unity user, nearly since version 1 of Unity, I was super excited to work at Unity. Unity always stood out as a company for the indie devs, your ally, your partner, to help you get past all the barriers in the industry that small players face. But I think ever since it went public it has gradually eroded into a pure profit growth driven business. Leadership cares about nothing more than what will get stock to go up in the short term. They've hired so many people from other Big Tech Corporations trying to essentially colonize original Unity culture with Big Tech Corporate process and culture, and they are winning. Many Unity originals, Engineers that have been there since the beginning have left. They pushed out Joachim, the original CTO, the last Unity original and real engineer on C-Suite, so literally Unity leadership has been entirely usurped by non-engineer business types. The only places still managing to do anything good are those places with very high level engineers that still have substantial political weight to throw around and happen to be in a stream that can be argued to make the stock price to go up short term. But increasingly they must fight against pure business side that greatly outnumbers them with free time to play the bureaucracy game. If the narrative about their effort affecting stop price changes, they will be rug-pulled fast. Being an engineer that can do anything of value is like sitting in a middle of a circus. They are cycling through managers and product people just trying to find anyway to milk any more cash from anything in the short term. They have even in the past year started to cannibalize some of their own customers. Unity isn't even a good company to partner with anymore, the relationship will be predatory and extorting, tuned for short term stock inflation however possible. It's a sad thing but I think its just the fate of any successful tech company. The engineers build something of value. Gradually the company hires more and more business people until they overtake the company, then a company once driven by engineers and engineering innovation is now driven by excel spreadsheets trying to get the stock price to go up however it possibly can to let the current round of business people to get a decent cash out on their stock options before jumping companies again every 3-ish years or so. Even worse, in recent months in response to sweeping corporate policy changes, they've actually taken to firing people on the spot who disagree with leadership. A few of these got out in the news, but there have been dozens of them. They were not all justified. Internal slack and communication has become much more shut down compared to what used to be a very open and communicative company. Increasingly it is only ""Yes Men"" saying anything out in the open. The business crowd that's usurped all controls of the company are playing a hard ball game of thrones with power. A bunch of engineering illiterate suits super super paranoid that people will figure out what they are and call them out on it are now sitting at the top terrified, trying to milk whatever nonsense they can for another stock payout or bit of nonsensical media attention."

Unity,2.0,"Apr 7, 2023",Bad,Software Engineer,Former Employee,,"Don’t know, food? Company name?","Very chaotic environment, no leadership, no direction. All work planned can get no where since the core is not strong. Distracted due to greediness — try to expand to area where it is not good at. Just focus on game please, focus on the engine. Stop all the crap nonsense. Hiring a team to nail the work that has no market proof. Another wrong example of using software can achieve things without very low cost —greediness. Lack of leaders. There are a lot of engineers of course, but no tech lead in general. Do not expect much training/learning."

Some managers are really good about it, while others... not so much.","- The company's leadership team has demonstrated consistently poor communication skills, resulting in a lack of direction and confusion among employees. - Benefits have been frequently removed, making it difficult for employees to rely on them. - Employees have even experienced pay decreases in the form of lost monetary benefits and pushed back promotion cycles - The culture promoted by Unity's leadership feels disingenuous and is only prioritized when it aligns with their agenda. - Unity lacks a clear company direction and has shown a lack of focus, jumping from one thing to another. - High-level management has been ineffective and detrimental (calling people f**** idiots) in engaging with the public and making decisions in good faith. - Team siloing is a persistent issue, creating a lack of collaboration and communication among departments. - Instead of dealing with the issues causing siloing and duplication of work, leadership just cuts the duplicates and continues to let the reason why the problem happened unaddressed. - The company has undergone constant restructuring, which damages productivity and established relationships among employees. - Unity has laid off individuals with years of experience, resulting in a loss of deeply knowledgeable employees with institutional knowledge. - Unity has shown a persistent dismissal of valid concerns and a tone-deaf approach to messaging. - Unity consistently prioritizes punishing people for how they criticize things. Instead of being concerned that frustration has reached a boiling point, they are easily distracted and emotional with how things are conveyed. They fixate on how a message is delivered and don't focus on the content of the message. - They frequently operate around feelings and emotional trends, and not data. - With trends company has a demonstrated history of chasing trends, for example, the metaverse and now AI"
