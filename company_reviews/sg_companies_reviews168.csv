Coworkers are generally good and helpful. Lower level management can be good also.

Ok benefits

For a recent graduate wanting experience, this might be an okay place for a temporary stay.","Using CPI Inflation calcualator, my current salary has less buying power than my starting pay did when I started a number of years ago.

Those nice things (BBQs, movie day, holiday meal and theme park day) coming from the company have disappeared for me.

Potential","Depressing, fatalistic atmosphere. 
No real strategic thinking - keeping the lights on is a full-time job.
No growth and steep declines in recent years since HPE acquisition. Company was doing well until that happened and has never recovered and not sure it ever will. 
Shuffled leadership and created many ""task forces"" and ""growth offices"" with redundant responsibilities.
Oodles of consultants that have yet to add value.
Added some new faces but they seem to be drug down by legacy players.
Continues to hemorrhage A-team talent primarily due to compensation - no material bonus payouts in years and next to no increases, stock has only declined precipitously
No plans to address attrition - attitude seams to be that if people leave on their own a RIF will not be needed.
Leadership seems to be either ""out of their league"" or so mired in legacy HPE thinking that no one has good ideas on how to realistically grow or stop the bleeding.
I hate writing this. I really enjoyed working there for a long time."
