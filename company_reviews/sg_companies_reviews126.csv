They keep getting better as the company scales.
Delivery Hero pays well but is not as competitive as they claim.","Politics can easily take place and stop you from being productive enough to grow and deliver the right value. Unfortunately, toxic managers stay in power and even get promoted, while they regularly get negative feedback from their team and peers in multiple cycles. Senior leadership is not close enough to monitor the manager's performance and HR partners don't take necessary actions to escalate cultural problems in a meaningful way (at least I didn't feel that it's happening). This might not be the case in all departments though, so make sure you ask the right questions during your interviews."

Delivery Hero,2.0,"Feb 8, 2024",A Mixed Experience of Growth and Challenges,Principal Product Manager,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",,"Working at Delivery Hero offers a unique opportunity for both professional and personal development. Being part of such a large organization allows you to engage in teamwork and contribute to a product on a grand scale. This environment is incredibly conducive to honing your skills and learning how to navigate complex projects and diverse teams effectively. The experience here is invaluable, providing a solid foundation for any professional looking to grow in their career.","However, one of the significant challenges within Delivery Hero is the lack of transparency regarding company decisions and employee relations. There exists a culture of secrecy where important information is often withheld until the last moment, making it difficult for employees to feel fully informed or engaged with the company's direction. This opacity can lead to uncertainty about the company's future and undermines trust in the leadership. Clear communication and transparency are areas that need considerable improvement to foster a more inclusive and trusting company culture."
Delivery Hero,1.0,"Dec 18, 2023",Stay away with a 10 foot pole!!,Recruiter,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Berlin,Used to be a good place to work.,"This place used to be a commendable workplace, one I could genuinely endorse and take pride in. Regrettably, the transformation it has undergone is deeply disappointing. The toxic atmosphere that descended after a series of layoffs is palpable.

We were inundated with demands for more projects and initiatives, most of which proved utterly meaningless and were promptly forgotten once delivered. The disheartening reality is that individuals here are primarily focused on justifying their salaries and falsely claiming credit for work they didn't genuinely contribute to.

Performance evaluations underwent frequent and arbitrary changes to align with management's preferences. Promotions and raises were inexplicably granted to those who excelled at flattery rather than demonstrating competent job performance. What's even more disheartening is that bringing up concerns about underperforming colleagues with your manager proved futile, as they simply brushed it aside.

Even if you consistently met all your deliverables, a lack of visibility would swiftly result in being placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PiP). This place has devolved into a hire-and-fire institution, where even individuals who relocated with their families found themselves out of a job within weeks.

Despite its aspirations to match the prestige of FAANG companies, the stark reality is that the compensation here doesn't even come close. They incessantly adopt detrimental practices from other companies while discarding existing, effective ones.

My advice to the management is simple: heed the voices of your employees. Until that crucial change takes place, I genuinely cannot, in good conscience, recommend Delivery Hero. I strongly advise steering clear of it."

Is management hiring people without knowing if they're going to be needed in 3 months? Seems like they don't know what they'll do next quarter, which shows poor planning skills. Plus, most of the people who were let go were ICs or low-level managers, which means that the company now has even more directors and VPs per person than before. Lots of people creating noise in meetings and not enough people to actually do the job."

Work life balance is fine, but this is due to the fact that we overhired and lately there was not that much work, after the latest layoff, things will probably change.",Multiple rounds of layoffs were executed over the past year and a lot of people were dismissed not fully legally. Employees who do not know their rights have been brainwashed to think that it is totally fine to be laid off due to poor performance (not fired the legal way but laid off).

* There is no transparency at all. We were improving in making the company profitable, but 433 employees were fired at Christmas. Furthermore, half of the company was sold in Asia and employees were notified because of a competency leak.

During my all probation period I have receiving very positive feedbacks like “great job”, “I’m happy that you are in my team”, “perfect, perfect, perfect” etc. In addition my team performed great that was confirmed by staff manager. I had a great connection with my team, all members valued me. All seemed to be good. That’s what I thought until the last week of my probation.
On the last week of my probation my manager + 2 HRs informed me that my probation was not successful and DH will not continue working relationships with me. My manager said that I was too in tech though she expected from me more dive in business. I was shocked, my team was working on API integration solutions. How comes PM of the team to be more in business then in tech? What about our agreements? It was so inconsistent, untrustworthy and misleading. I can accept that expectations might have changed, but this ALWAYS MUST be communicated in timely manner but not on the last working day! I consider it as unfair and harmful for all parties: me, my team, DH. Absolutely wired experience. Maybe there were other reason (mass layoffs recently, so if it was costs optimisation everyone who is on probation are at highest risk), but the one that was declared seems to be a nonsense."

The company's erratic approach to business leaves employees uncertain about their future. It feels like there's no clear path forward, just a series of disjointed decisions made on a whim.

As for compensation, it's not exactly stellar. The pay is lackluster, considering the tumultuous environment and the expectation of dedication. The office dynamics are far from welcoming, with an overall vibe that lacks cohesion and friendliness among colleagues.
