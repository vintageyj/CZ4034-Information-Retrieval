Helps to ruin and destroy career aspirations of many.","High firing rates. Firing engineers and even new joiners without any reason. To some newbies, they even hired some already working employees of other Singapore companies, and then laid them off within 3 months.

No work-life balance. Bad management. Especially Indian managers have a superiority complex and bossy nature which they have picked up wrongly from the Japanese background.

No manager shows up on time when dealing with employee scheduled meeting. Except a few, everyone gives reason that they are very busy, but in reality no one is busy there. They are just busy playing games and poking nose in others' work.

For those who say salary is high - it is, but not helpful in long run. High salary is because of bonus and AWS. The basic salary is still not high. When applying for other jobs in Singapore, perspective employers only consider basic pay. So it does not provide any edge for new career opportunities.

No clear vision or motivation. They pose as if they are very innovative and out of box. But in reality they are not."

3) Good technical people leaving the company 
But now once again Works Applications has started to work with new vision, new goals and let's hope we make it. :)

Some would say that sounds much like cons, pros are here for you :
1) You are free to think, that is the best one I have got
You think of new features to support your team, you can pitch your ideas and work on it, not gets better than this anywhere.
2) Competitive Salary
As I said not best but not worst, still competitive.
3) Easy life

- Bad evaluation system to judge employee performance. It highly depends on team leader or manager's perspective. It's not fair across the company. There are some teams whose leader or managers are good, they don't need to work hard but still get high grade. However, other teams are not under good manager, even they work hard, they still get bad grade. Bad grade means not increase in salary and going to higher rank.
- Deadlines are a lot. Developers usually do not have time to think about good solution to solve problem. My personal opinion is quality product is not so good in term of designing. Later, it will really cost in maintenance phase."

2) They have suddenly decided to close two out of the their three divisions including a) Software Development and b) QA & Testing.  due to which they have decided to increase the difficulty of the STM (training they provide in India for 3 months) and will terminate anyone with grades (B, C and D) after the training. Earlier, they used to terminate only people with D grade after STM. This is resulting in terminating about 75% of the employees (as they mentioned themselves) after training as compared to only 10% last year.

- boss-driven over product-oriented: implementation, troubleshooting and decision-making are driven by bosses' demands, rather than being rooted in facts or product oriented. Development may change course anytime as long as some big bosses want it that way, despite the fact that it breaks development roadmap or apparently violates engineering practices.
- process over engineering: overly complicated processes are made to restrict technical discussion and decisions and writing, submitting and releasing code, which is iconic Japanese Ho-Ren-So culture and greatly endorsed by higher managers. Managers block developers from submitting code, thinking it is able to stabilize the build and improve the quality of products.
- firefighting over troubleshooting: too many engineers are mobilised for putting off sparks instead of solving the root problem. Too many temporary fixes have been made permanent. Firefighters are rewarded and admired as heroes while those who prevent the fire from the very beginning are often neglected."
Works Applications,1.0,"Jan 21, 2016",A Complete Farce,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Singapore,"-High salary for fresh graduates, way above the market rate. 
-Flexi-work improves productivity. 
-Sincere and congenial colleagues 
-Some senior staffs are genuinely passionate
-Great breadth in work scope","-Salary increments are virtually non-existent before you move up to the next level of hierarchy (they always tell you 10% increments, but subsequently deducts 10% from your annual bonus..). Besides, which company in the 21st century still standardize employee salaries across the globe? Haven't they studied basic compensation bench-marking? To think that they actually do HR systems is unimaginable. 
-Completely clueless in global business operation - half the senior staffs cannot even complete a single sentence in English verbally, not to mention conducting business globally. 
-Lack of competent leadership and training for juniors. 
-Unethical way of doing business that doesn't work outside Japan
-Pessimistic business performance for years (performance is not published as they are not a listed company but you can easily get from research databases)"
Works Applications,1.0,"Mar 29, 2019",Managers are ruining the product.,Team Lead,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Singapore,"1. If you want to be a shoelicker and get promoted, this is the best workplace for you.","1. Just read through the previous reviews, most of the positive reviews are written by managers. You know why, i will tell ya. 

Reason : 
1. No work other than updating tickets. Lot of work man, really. 
2. Get promoted if you are a shoelicker. 
3. They just take orders and do not have any input of their own. 
4. They might be a good engineer but they are not good as a manager and so as their product. 
5. They come in morning, one window they have slack and other has whatsapp, and then they keep posting message, @here update tickets. 
6. They encourage team to merge buggy code and then create 100s of patch tickets, which resulted into failure of so many products. 
7. Evaluation is only about how much buttering you do. People don't even know their tech well and now they are manager and ruining the product. 
8. In short, managers know they are bad at their work, but they are getting really high pay compared to their contribution."

- Flexible work hour (doesn't mean short work hour)
- Can be relaxing depending on the team
- Friendly environment
- Good HR department","- Higher up sucks. They dont have a good plan to run company. Actually they had: go public IPO and profit as much as they can. After that they dont care about how the company does. But Japanese stock exchange did not let them(they are not stupid). So their so called worksap-good-company-bubble burst. Just see the glassdoor rating curve over the years.  Their financial status is not good. Their product is not ready and their pocket is running dry. 
- Manager dont know how to schedule & manage teams. Here you can become manager after 3 yrs, so obviously they dont have enough business knowledge to manage a team.
- They treat developers as liabilities rather than asset."

Company has a great vision and is still in the process to achieve them. They are almost like a startup and if you enjoy fast pace and being busy, you will enjoy working here. Unlike a Japanese company, this is a place where the age doesn't matter and what you do matters. Also they have a culture to let you have mistakes and accept them.",Keeping a work-life balance is very hard. Many people work till the last train which is after midnight and you have to have stamina to keep up. Whenever the delivery time is close. people often work on weekends.

Works Applications,2.0,"Jan 18, 2018",Not a tech company,Research and Development Engineer,Current Employee,,"- High salary for fresh graduates
The starting pay for fresh graduates is higher than average

- Talented and friendly colleagues (depends on the team)
The office is full of young people. There are some who are really talented and most of co-workers are nice and friendly. 

- Flexible working hours (depends on the team)
The working hours are pretty flexible if deliverables are not due and you do not have meetings to attend. However, there is no option to work remotely. 

- Possibility of transferring to Japan
It is possible to request for a transfer to Japan after you stay for a certain period of time in the company. It's an opportunity for those who wants to experience the Japanese culture. 

- Excellent sales team 
The sales team in Japan is top notch. They are actually able to sell software based on nothing but paper. In fact, they are the ones that are lifting the entire company.","- 50 shades of managers
Clueless, racist, incompetent, pushers, know-it-alls, pretenders, and the list goes on. Just name a trait and you have a very high probability of finding a manager like that. 

- Out of touch top management
The top management is completely out of touch with the situation on the ground and the actual status of the product. Because of this, they are making decisions which becomes a hindance or has no impact value. 

- Politics among managers
When you try to request help from other teams, the other team managers always find some way to avoid it instead of trying to find a solution. There is no smooth collaboration between team managers. In the end, nothing gets done and delays keep piling on. 

- Spreadsheets for everything
They love to use spreadsheets for all purposes, instead of using proper tools. This applies even for diagram drawing. Can you imagine how troublesome it is to create complex diagrams in excel? 

- Misallocation of resources
PhD holders do screen mockups; Master's holders do trivial work; Arts graduates write code; Developers write essays and draw UI instead of coding. There isn't a proper allocation based on skills and interest. 

- No experts with experience
The tech architecture leads are wannabes who has no real experience with production software. Their decisions are supported with weak evidence at best. There is no real tech lead who has the know-how and expertise to lead the way. 

- Reinventing the wheel
They love to reinvent the wheel instead of using something that has been battle-tested. Instead of paying a small cost to use commercial software, they pay even more money to reinvent it in-house, which ends up being subpar. Some excellent libraries and frameworks are even open source so it costs nothing to use . They recreate everything in-house, claiming that what is in the market cannot achieve what they want. The outcome is a bloated piece of mess that constantly breaks every step of the way. In addition, the upper management forces these frameworks to be used, which totally hinders productivity. 

- Dubious development cycle
Their ""sprints"" have all the negatives of agile and waterfall, but none of the benefits. 

- Resistance to change
Even with all the above cons, the higher management refuses to admit their mistake and change their strategy. Instead, they pat themselves on the back and say all is dandy. The bottom level can so clearly see the inherent flaws and there are so many calls for change but it doesn't happen. 

- No structured training
There is no process where people can pick up skills in a natural manner. Because you don't learn much, your skills remain stagnant."
