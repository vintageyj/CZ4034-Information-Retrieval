Konica Minolta Business Solutions,2.0,"Feb 14, 2024","Not a difficult job. Poor training, Upper management is out of touch",Account Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,There is a lot of flexibility for time and everyone in the division is helpful. The job isn't difficult. Direct managers are all really good people. Good job for someone with minimal experience.,Upper/Senior management are very out of touch with what our job really is and what it takes to be successful. The markets we sell in are totally diluted (some of which is KM's fault). You will be competing against your own machines at a cheaper price by 3rd party re-sellers. High stress times = crazy amounts of micro management. No room for career growth. Service sucks too.

After I left, they wanted to hire me back and would give me a raise but when I asked for one before I left, I was told no. I got overpaid commission and didn't realize it since they were doing advances on commission since delivery time was 6-9 months. They withheld my commission 4 months later with 0 notice. I had to door dash every day after work to make up for it and started losing my hair from stress. Asked for a raise and no one cared!"

Due to poor logistics, accountability, and clarity on orders placed - our operations and logistics teams frequently rely on feedback from customers to let us know something was not completed. They will not reach out to schedule. They will wait until the customer is questioning what's going on enough to reach out and ask what happened.

Money is decent for people getting by not for a family","They never give raises 
They never give promotions 
They care only in numbers 
They want you to be in and out within a hour 
They will put 20 plus calls on a screen 
They don't want you to next day anything due to cost and if you do you gotta ask a manager and have them agree while at customer site
Even being a tech for 8 years never once received a promotion after doing office equipment and production equipment
You use your own vehicles so get ready for ware and tare on your personal stuff and they don't pay for tires, maintenance on your vehicle and you have to do it on your own time not company time and they expect you to be on site at 8 am no matter the time you leave in the morning and your not paid going to the account and they mark your miles during company time and by end of day your mileage doesn't count going home. 
The insurance is expensive and not that great Cigna is what they use
They will throw you to the wolves
Low salary with little raises if any 
They don't care about the techs and see them to be replaced with ease
They care more about there parts then your life

Long Sales Process

Lack of Organizational Structure"
Konica Minolta Business Solutions,3.0,"Dec 12, 2023",Great Work Life Balance,Admin Ops Specialist,Current Employee,"Andover, MA",Work life balance is great especially if you have a kid or in school.,The pay for all of the job responsibilities in the administration team is nowhere near enough to support a single person household. It can be difficult to work cohesively with sales if you’re a team player due to the variety of personalities.
Konica Minolta Business Solutions,2.0,"Nov 18, 2023","Good entry level job, but not a career.",Accounting Administrator,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Ramsey, NJ","There are many entry-level positions at Konica Minolta and the company is willing to take a chance on individuals who lack experience. The training was decent and managers are fine with letting you learn at your own pace. Coworkers are more than willing to lend a helping hand and help fellow staff members get up to speed.

The work environment is generally comfortable and there is a cafeteria on site. The company also hosts lots of events and activities for staff, especially during the holidays.

Their corporate roles are good for entry-level folks looking to gain some exposure to, and experience in the corporate world.","The biggest con at this company is lack of flexibility and WFH options. During the pandemic everyone worked from home. Then they implemented a hybrid policy that allowed for 2 days WFH. Then they only allowed one day a week as WFH. The 2 days WFH seemed reasonable, and lowering WFH to one day a week seemed unwarranted. They implemented some new stuff to make up for it, but what is the point? Why not just let us WFH at least 2 days a week? Most of the jobs at Ramsey HQ can be done completely remotely to begin with. Seems completely unnecessary. From what I understand, folks in upper management are allowed to work completely remotely. Rules for thee, but not for me. 

In addition, there is a high degree of micromanaging here. Seems that most managers do not care about quality of work. The only thing that managers seem to care about is if you are sitting at your desk like a good worker bee. Don't be away from your desk too often or 5 minutes late because someone will tattle on you. Also, don't ask for too many days off or your manager might get annoyed. A lot of long-time employees will be rude, disrespectful, and bossy. Some of the disrespect you can experience is truly shocking. But it seems like people just put up with it because KM is the only place they have ever known and they are afraid to leave."

The company has done a great job to provide incentives to learn, opportunities to take on new projects and business plans. My immediate manager has provided great support and guidance to help me advance my career. The products we support, the everyday people I interact with are great to work with. In my role, I interact with a large cross section of the company from sales, service, administration, logistics, finance, warehouse teams and everyone is generally friendly and easy to work with.","Providing a more clear growth path to help advance in position, while recognizing the challenges we face by being more lean in headcount.

Konica Minolta Business Solutions,2.0,"Jul 14, 2022",Look elsewhere,Parts Coordinator,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"Most colleagues are pleasant. That's it, really.","No promotional potential. Definition of a dead-end job. Awful compensation. An employee actually warned me during my first week to ""make sure they pay me."" In 3 years, I've only received a single 1% raise, and the same for my coworker. No cost-of-living increases; in doing the math on the US Fed BLS. website, I've lost over $7k since starting here due to inflation alone. I was even rated as ""exceeding expectations"" one year and still received nothing. Company constantly tries to find ways to cut costs while charging customers more, but never passes any of the increased profits down the line. Old fashioned ""on-site"" culture.

Dying industry--printing. Good luck 10 years from now. Contracts lost frequently due to most companies going 100% remote.

Come here only if you have a plan to leave and need a stopping point, and definitely don't come if you'd be working in the ""lower ranks"" such as warehouse, etc. They barely recognize you're human and will treat you as if you're a general laborer for the rest of the company and assign you tasks unrelated to your actual job."

If you like to build new capabilities, spearhead new initiatives, and be challenged to learn new skills every day, then this is a great time to be part of Konica Minolta.

Truly care about people and are evolving to be more responsive to employees' career development needs and goals.","Change is hard....it means getting out of your comfort zone. It means there are people who are unhappy, stressed, and not bought-in. However, the executive leadership has been as transparent as possible about the direction the company is going. Regular town halls by the CEO and executive leadership team has been outlining the strategies for employees.
Nothing is perfect and there are lots of employee initiatives that are in the works, but not yet delivered. The future is bright, but navigating."
