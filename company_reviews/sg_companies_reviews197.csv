Motional,5.0,"Jan 19, 2024",Probably one of the best places to work,Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Pittsburgh, PA","The company makes extremely good use of employee engagement surveys. Every single piece of critical constructive feedback I've given has been acted on. The Cloud Apps Director and Principal Engineer Team Leads at this company show that they care for individuals with their actions, and are open-minded continuous learners who lead by example. Amazing benefits package. The company seems healthy and successful despite challenging economic times. C-level and VP-level leadership is doing an amazingly good job.","This is a tough industry to be in. The work can be demanding (but for those who genuinely want to learn and grow in their career, there is no shortage of room to grow). Grit, courage, and self-driven continuous learner mentality is a requirement for this company, which isn't a con per se, but sometimes conditions are ambiguous and challenging in innovation spaces during uncertain economy. Internal team compositions are sometimes awkward when working across teams, which isn't horrible but there's room for improvement that can make our need for agility and cross-functional knowledge-work less demanding."

In Motional's case, in my experience, there's good company culture and my manager is wonderful as well. I have the freedom to make an impact, and am encouraged to do so. I see negative reviews online (on Blind, for example) before I joined motional about how they are not confident about the company. I have worked for other AV companies. Motional is clearly not the leader in the AV space, but it isn't the worst either. It has huge backing from Mega players like Hyundai and Aptiv, which means A LOT, and we're accelerating towards delivering driverless vehicles in several cities very soon. Their pay structure is also good, with lots of stocks too, (unlike some other places where the stocks will expire if you leave, etc). Work life balance is relatively better, compared to all other AV companies I have heard (or worked) for, which actually results in better efficiency of employees so they can get actually more work done, instead of being forced to slave away for long, inefficient, hours.","Like all AV companies, this is a new , huge and challenging problem that we all are trying hard to solve for the first time ever.

If there was genuine interest for a solution, they would have done *something*, instead of deferring people here to talk to HR. As another recent comment here said, people might reasonably be afraid to talk to HR in fears of being singled out.

Motional definitely allows individuals to take ownership of their work and drive solutions cross-functionally across the organization. The leadership are good at being transparent about issues that we're facing and helping solve challenges head-on rather than shying away. Everyone is very open and supportive. There's a solid culture for working together and helping each other rather than just trying to ""climb the corporate ladder"".","There are some challenges with overlapping responsibilities and roles across teams. Because every team is empowered to take initiative, many times there are multiple teams that end up working on similar things and duplicating work if they don't coordinate. There's also having ""too many cooks in the kitchen"". Sometimes many people want to provide their opinion which can inhibit progress from being accomplished.

Motional,4.0,"Jan 25, 2023",Tons of Inertia - For better or worse,Senior Technical Program Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"Motional leaders seem to be generally willing to allow contributors to innovate and pursue ideas they find compelling. There is tremendous flexibility and ability to get the job done however the individual sees fit. Surprisingly for a company of its size and with so much influence/investment by major legacy corporations, there is not a lot of needless process and red tape over relatively trivial things. Overall, the attitude seems generally positive, the diversity of people is relatively strong, and the breadth of the company means there is tremendous opportunity for those who wish to find it. The amount of funding Motional has accrued at this point in 2022 has enabled it to become a relatively large company for AV, which even in light of some points of concern instills confidence in the survival of the company for long enough to really begin to truly scale the technology.","Unfortunately, the evolution of Motional as the confluence of several startups and contributions from an automotive OEM and Tier One supplier show...there is a head-scratching amount of work that is lost and redone between product iterations. There are, also, a surprising number of technical capabilities that younger and/or much smaller companies have already attained that Motional has not. A surprisingly dogmatic approach to technology development (ML models for everything!) restricts the pace of advancement and makes for endless headaches on the part of Validation and test teams. Because Motional has only now begun really investing in commercial partnerships (the prior deployment in Las Vegas was really treated as a side show in a lot of ways), it has relatively informal and lax practices and policies around public-facing operations (though, it should be said, not with respect to safety). The extraordinarily conservative nature of the product design (a safety driver AND a safety operator in every vehicle) makes the path to driverless - a goal toward which all AV companies are working - a steep one, even relative to industry peers. The biggest con, in my opinion, is that the lack of structure creates a lot of confusion and churn, and then an incredible amount of duplicated work. It also leads to strained relationships across functions, when the work one group does is not adequately communicated to another, and then priorities/work/finished product conflicts."

As the company is still relatively young, there is a lot of opportunities for growing and building your career.","Motional is actively trying to fix the gaps in its business and I honestly feel that by the time I post this review, the review would have become obsolete. I like how there is a constant push to improve."
Motional,4.0,"Oct 13, 2022",Motional Moves,Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,,Great pay and benefits. Work from-home policy for certain positions is very gracious and pay isn't adjusted based on your location. Occasionally will pay for travel to meet team members. Colleagues are very intelligent and some of the best educated I've ever met. The work is meaningful and the goal of the company is a very important one that can change the way we live. Being able to contribute to that goal has given me inspiration that what I'm doing matters.,Some engineering tasks can take longer than wanted due to CI struggles. There have been a couple of reorganizations in the recent past.

Motional,2.0,"Dec 30, 2021",Mediocre but has the potential to be GREAT,Systems Engineer,Former Employee,,"1- Nice office and amenities (the Boston location),
2- Easy going coworkers (for the most part)
3-  Comfortable pace","1- Questionable decision-making and poor management team
2- No clear planning/goals/transparency company wide and most people are confused
3- Limited opportunities to learn and grow
4- Stagnating career development, and management went above and beyond to make it look easy on paper but hard to actually move up (looking at you HR)
5- Benefits are good but compensation (the cash part) is nowhere near competitive
6- If you still want to go ahead and take your chances, I’d highly suggest you negotiate well for your salary/compensation package because that’s what you’ll be stuck with for a quite some time"
Motional,2.0,"May 2, 2022","OK management, ridiculous HR team",Senior TPM,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"Nice offices with expected 'Silicon Valley' style perks, engineering teams well resourced with good leadership (especially the hardware side of the company). BD teams were perhaps too effective at securing external partnerships for deployments. Strong financial backing from Hyundai (pay was pretty good for a non-costal job).","Program management operated in an extremely myopic fashion; was very clear the program managers in charge were more concerned with having a good 'scorecard' rather than fostering the development of a scalable product.

Despite the strong financial backing of Hyundai, the working relationship was very dysfunctional in most areas, especially engineering and with regard to communication (downplaying) of risks.

I've never seen an HR org more drunk on wokeness & power (and I've worked at Google)."

Great potential to move within the company and grow.","There are often times there are ""too many cooks in the kitchen"" to get an initiative done. It's difficult wrangling all the stakeholders in for meetings or discussions at the same time.

- People within smaller teams/orgs are nice to each other
- Compensations and efforts for pay-equity have been great","- Everyone is pushing their own agenda, with lack of alignment at the leadership level. 
- Inter-team finger pointing in sync up meetings keeps getting worse
- The PMO is adding little value as an organization, though there are good PMs within. This was not helped by the VP of PMO taking up another role, leaving the problems in the PMO they were meant to address a problem for the future without a define path to get better."

Motional,5.0,"Jun 6, 2022",Great experience thus far!,Triage Specialist,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Pitts, PA","The work life balance has been stressed repeatedly by senior management and encourage to take time when needed. Unlimited PTO is really unlimited PTO here and it shows in the employees. 

Management is there to support and help rather than micro manage. Saves the company precious time and money and encourages self reliance. Management is always there for you if they are needed but not breathing down you neck.

While the company is rather large, it is still relatively new and there is a lot of opportunity for growth and to help make change.

Diversity acceptance is EVERYTHING here. I love seeing all the outreach for the diverse workforce that is present.","Health benefits are lacking compared to the AV competition with similar salary.
IE Premium options are employer paid by other companies."
