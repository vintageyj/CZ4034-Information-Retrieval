Tata Consultancy Services (North America),3.0,"Mar 10, 2024",A Candid Look at Tata Consultancy Services for Business Analysts,Business Analyst,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"Professional Development Opportunities: TCS offers various training programs and resources for skill enhancement, providing avenues for professional growth and development for business analysts.

Diverse Project Exposure: Business analysts at TCS have the opportunity to work on a variety of projects spanning different industries and domains, allowing for a broadening of skills and knowledge.

Emphasis on Work-Life Balance: TCS promotes work-life balance through flexible work arrangements and wellness initiatives, demonstrating a commitment to supporting employees' overall well-being.","Communication Challenges: There are instances where communication breakdowns have led to misunderstandings and delays in project timelines, highlighting the need for clearer communication channels within the organization.

Complexity of Projects: Some projects at TCS have been overly complex, requiring extensive problem-solving skills from business analysts. While this offers learning opportunities, it can also be overwhelming at times.

Workload Management: Despite efforts to promote work-life balance, there are occasions when project demands encroach upon this balance, necessitating careful time management and boundary-setting by employees."

TCS, you shattered me into pieces. It took time, but I've gathered myself, and I'm in the process of repairing the damage you caused.","A freshman who is hired in the US basically never gets any mentorships.
Most managers are busy with their tasks, and they have prejudice and jealousy toward freshmen who are immigrant Indians who are in permanent residence in the US. It might be because they had a hard way to get to the USA and still struggling because of visa issues."

This is a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the IT industry and the unpredictable challenges we all face. It's my duty to share this news with the TCS community, not only to keep you informed but also to shed light on the harsh realities many are facing in today's economic climate. To those directly affected, I extend my deepest sympathies and support. I was laid off this week, without notice. 

Plan now for your next job... especially if you're on the bench and have been on the bench for longer than 2 weeks. Everyone on the bench is at risk!"
Tata Consultancy Services (North America),2.0,"Jan 8, 2024",Mixed Results,OTC Tower Lead,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Redmond, WA","They do take care of their employees in their own way. During COVID they were very understanding about it and didn't even make you use sick time or PTO. They gave me a severance package I didn't know I would get and had me ""on the bench"" for two months WITH PAY before letting me go.","Management is all or nearly all Indian, and you don't get opportunities to move up very far if you're not.
They made us all take a class on how to deal with the Indian culture when we started. I'm sorry, but you are coming to America to do business, you should be working within OUR culture. I'm not going to go to India and demand American rights.
I noticed that the treated women and LGBTQ folks less seriously, either not promoting when they should, or outright firing for no reason.
The management are ""yes men"" to their clients, regardless as to whether the ask is in the scope of the contract or even achievable.
The amount of pointless corporate training is laughable, and some of it isn't even relevant to US personnel. Also, sometimes random classes are suddenly ""mandatory"" because some upper management has a goal to increase the group's training level. Pointless."

IF you do not act like a pompous/arrogant American and actually try to befriend your new Eastern co-workers, You can really have a team to support you to navigate both companies.","You will be an outcast when you realize how differently they do business. They are not aggressive with the client and if the client perceives that, the client ends up steering the project. You will have two employers; the client and TCS. You will have cultural engagement put upon you and it will be distracting from your immediate duties. If a choice between you or the client, they will go with keeping you quiet and acting like nothing is wrong with management. You are expendable.

There is no empathy, dignity, or value for your contribution. They take advantage of resources that are dependent on the company to process their Visa further to settle in this country, I wonder how this type of company culture exists in this age, ancient school and micro-managers who keep changing all the time.

Tata Consultancy Services (North America),3.0,"Dec 5, 2023",Experience Really Depends on Manager,Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Aurora, IL","Lots of incentive opportunities and access to continuous learning platforms to further your craft. As long as your performance review is good, you're guaranteed some sort of bonus - at least at entry level.","Management can make things both very unpleasant and very confusing. There are a ton of profile and systems you have to do upkeep on that as a new employee I didn't know about until I was in trouble for not doing them. After initial training which is more of a ""how to code."" tutorial then training on the company, what you know is completely up to the first manager.

Also, how much you are involved with and enjoy your job is really dependent on the project. My first project I was treated like a temp worker and not even allowed to touch the code. I was strictly supposed to review logs and figure out where the problem was (not even solve it! Pass it on to someone else after that). There was quite little for me to do day-to-day and I became very discouraged. I would also be berated for not doing things that I was never told to do or HOW to do, to the point where another co-worker had to act as a buffer between me and management there.

My next assignment was much better in the beginning! I was treated like an employee who knew what they were doing and was given time to learn the code base and then was immediately expected to contribute. I loved that! Things started to go south later on because we started getting new team members and I was expected to do my job and also manage their jobs, even though I was just another developer. It was to the point I was working late because 80% of my day had been taken up with making sure they got their parts done as I was asked by my team lead.

In addition to that, this job has no employee protections against overtime or limits on working hours or days. If the client/project needs you after your 8 - 4 shift to come in 9pm to 12am you just HAVE to and no, you will not be paid for those hours. There was one point they wanted me to work 14 days straight, overtime on some of those days, with no breaks and no additional pay incentive. Yikes."
