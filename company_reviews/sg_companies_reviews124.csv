ADP,4.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Great Company, needs to increase pay",District Manager,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Roseland, NJ","ADP is an excellent company with a great culture of letting people come to work as they are. It is a large organization with a lot of potential to move around in. The company has great, reliable products and a strong history of success. The management from top to bottom is in tune with current market situations, and people are encouraged to speak up with new ideas. Outside of pay, the benefits are also really solid.","The base salary starting out is shockingly low. The Associate District Manager salary is actually embarrassingly low compared to other organizations, it is almost laughable. The company seriously needs to evaluate the base pay for associates starting out to attract and retain great talent."
ADP,3.0,"Feb 21, 2024",Ok for a little while,District Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Cleveland, OH","The pro's were great training, great products and a fair compensation for the roll.",Inappropriate comments from colleagues and confusing bonus structure.

Good work life balance
If you get a good territory and partner alignment you are gonna do well here. If not and have a high turnover and young partners good luck. You are gonna struggle to pay bills","Low ball salaries for high stress.
Management gets promoted to management with no prior leadership experience. They just get the role as a consolation prize for being with the company for so long. 
Large org easy to get lost in the weeds on being just a number.
Management would rather manage you out the company and keep a revolving door by bringing in someone they hope will do the job instead of leading and training current person to do it.
Favorites are definitely a thing.
CEO Maria black came to the office and didn’t attempt to speak to any employees. Although she walked through the building she didn’t acknowledge any of us including management like we are some Peons."
ADP,4.0,"Mar 7, 2024",Good company,Associate District Manager,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Marlborough, MA","Good Culture. Work with other generally intelligent people. Promotes from within. Flexible schedule. Great training. Product is oftentimes necessary for businesses. ADP is a familiar name for prospects. Good centers of influences, partnerships with banks/CPAs. Business doesn’t have to come all from cold calling. Good gas reimbursement.",Lower base pay. Lower OTE. Boring product - tough to stay motivated. Particularly tough if you have an unfavorable territory. Some territories are MUCH better than others. Management can be pushy at times. Management favors reps with higher quotas. Typical corporate fluff and lack of transparency when it comes to things happening higher up in the organization.
ADP,3.0,"Feb 17, 2024",Great People but Poor Training and Inadequate Resources/Support,Sr. Implementation Consultant,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","Roseland, NJ","People are great, remote work options, management means well and tries to offer support.","First and foremost, training has been severely lacking for a few years. You get minimal training watching videos or recordings. It's a ""fend for yourself"" culture of trying to get up to speed while attempting to offer a satisfactory level of service to clients. There is also a poor time off structure (not as many Holidays or PTO as other comparable companies). Not to mention, often times employees don't feel able to take time off for any length of time due to being overloaded with work and extra challenging deadlines that need to be met on multiple projects. Management tries to help but often seem to have their hands tied with regard to assisting with arranging desperately needed training and adequate resources."
ADP,5.0,"Mar 7, 2024",Great Sales Training,Mid Market District Manager,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Orlando, FL","Great Sales Training, was great culture (can go in & out depending on leader), uncapped commissions, great benefits/401-k/stock purchase program, great work-life balance and vacation flexibility, not too difficult a job, great referral partnerships","It's a grind as it's all new business sales. You're ultimately just a number and can be let go at any time for anything, with no debate or deliberation or consideration of the person you are and have been to the company. No way for senior leadership to back you Not the highest base in the industry."
ADP,2.0,"Feb 12, 2024",Not as great as I'd hoped,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Alpharetta, GA","It's a large company, so there is plenty of opportunity for growth for both vertical and horizontal moves. 
Ans relatively good base pay.","Inconceivably extreme micromanagement environment masked by the concept of ""feedback"". It's not feedback; it's micromanagement. I cannot make up that once I supposedly ""used the wrong shade of blue"" on a document. I even had internal Microsoft Teams messages reviewed before I could hit send to other internal employees.

Get it right the first time or be castigated is the status quo and strangely accepted by everyone.

Unrealistic workload expectations with a workaholic company culture with some employees even bragging about how late they had to stay up to work. 

You'll have no say into your own work. Do what the highest paid person in the room says to do, even if it completely contradicts previous directions from the exact same person.

Hardly the best benefits, especially for a company that specializes in that sort of thing."
ADP,3.0,"Mar 9, 2024",Great place to start... not a great place to stay,Elite Senior District Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Denver, CO","I personally really loved worked here for a variety of reasons:
1. Autonomy/flexibility. I never felt like someone was breathing down my neck making sure I was working. (could depend on your manager)
2. The people. Wow the people are really incredible.
3. Great intro to sales","The management is super young (early to mid 20's) and so are the people they hire so it can just feel really juvenile at times.
Growth is also super limited here if you don't want to go into sales leadership...
It is honestly a lot of work to keep up with for the amount of pay (>70k). Full sales cycle plus maintaining referring relationships is very exhausting."
ADP,1.0,"Feb 14, 2024",Theoretically great- incredible disappointment,"District Manager, Major Accounts",Current Employee,,"Global industry leader- excellent insights, trends, data, etc.
Unfortunately, everything is like an episode of the twilight zone when you work there…
The contrast between the vision and insights the CEO and company provides the world vs. middle management’s conceptual understanding and adoption of best current trends and practices COULDN’T BE FURTHER APART FROM EACH OTHER.
This will drive you mad if you have any experience in b2b business development, channel sales, or brains in general…
Extremely disappointing to watch every good faith, hard earned sale get ultimately “No Start” because the client is disgusted with the implementation issues for so long they just pull the plug.  And ADP punishes a sales person for this- when the sales person has literally zero control over the implementation experience and technical aspects of that 20+ person team.
Sucks. Because theres a great opportunity for ADP revenue to grow significantly in markets where these clueless managers are- and instead they fail and the employees are failed, and ultimately the geographical community is failed by inability for mid sized businesses to be supported with innovation from ADP.",See pros.
