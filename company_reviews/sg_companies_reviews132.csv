Feels like immediate team cares about you, but definitely not leadership.
As far as I'm aware recent layoffs had a nice severance (5 months). Unsure if will be that way still going forward.","No recent salary increases. Pay is not as high as other companies. Bonus is only ever stock.
Rto mandate even though you're team is in different states and countries, so you drive in for zoom meetings. It also doesn't take into account pto or sick days, so it encourages people to come in sick. (Told you have to ""plan better"" if you can't make minimum...).
Half of your time will be meetings, more talking about how to do the work and not enough time to do it.
Pto amount not super generous, wellness weekends help. 
Reorgs removed required roles that business is not refilling, so more non work put on others outside of sprint commitments."

The blend of incompetence and sometimes borderline hostility from management has put us in a very bad spot. The recent re-org was and continues to be the worst roll out I have experienced. From what I can see, morale is at an all time low and no one knows what to do. Any time we think we are going to get an update, meetings get cancelled. Most questions get answered with anywhere between ""I don't know"" and ""We will have to see"". Productivity seems to have been effectively shut down while management decides what to do with the re-org. - Layoffs, followed by a re-org, then followed by RTO is not the way to keep talent at F5. - Compensation is all over the place.

Return to Office - for a company that prides itself on being transparent and honest, whose nominal credo starts with ""First and foremost, we do the right thing"" they lied their ***** off about their motivations for RTO. ""We, a data-driven, numbers-based company want to impose the cataclysmic costs of commuting of up to 3 hours daily on our employees with no compensation to reap all the tax benefits which the company will retain."" All the costs on us, none of the benefits. So we can have more ""collaboration."" Like I can collaborate better in the Seattle office with colleagues in Hyderabad than I could from home. Bullpucky. No, they are getting tax breaks for occupancy and don't care how much damage they inflict to get it. The CEO can make a case. That he failed to do so tells me there is no case to make. At least, none that would be acceptable over ""because I said so."" The FAQ on RTO they published reads like an essay by a student who didn't read the assignment. ""How about the climate impact of all those extra trips?"" ""We are very concerned about climate change. (EOM)"" Not concerned enough to not impose all those miles of commuting on some of the most congested roads in the U.S. So anyway, I have no trust. I hate the hypocrisy of touting corporate values they ignore. ""People first"" - right. Look, I'd have some respect if they were honestly exploitive instead of pretending they weren't.

Now, all they care about is wringing more out from people to increase the bottom line. Deadlines are incredibly tight and have destroyed the work life balance F5 was famous for. Anyone who doesn't buy into the burnout culture they are forming is deemed expendable. Management no longer cares about employee wellness or health and their product direction is simply chasing the next release without any long term vision.

The soul of the company and the pros that we had were mostly removed in the past few years. Recent pro, wellness weekends as a few extra PTO days.","Employee engagement programs were all but shut down. People who worked across departments were all let go. Internal Promotions were almost non-existent. External hiring added management at all levels who would show up, announce a major change to boost their name and then leave. Compensation did not even try to keep up with the market. 2 years with no raises due to pandemic uncertainty, followed by a ""raise"" and a cut in RSUs that landed in a wash despite huge cost of living increases at the same time. RTO demands while over 3/4 of employees did not see value in returning. Distributed teams not properly managed by inflexible managers. Unreasonable hours and regular weekend work because no-one felt they could actually log off for a break. I was here for over 5 years, and there was only 1 year we did not have either a major re-org or large layoffs. Layoffs often selected employees who were not redundant forcing others to pick up the slack and learn new skills rapidly. This resulted of course in spreading resources to thin, diminishing meeting SLAs on both systems, and then the employees picking up the slack being judged for not meeting what multiple people were doing before. After years of this, the weight of 5 or more resources were being carried by individual burnt out people who had no hope for improvement or any chance at success. The company has not been releasing products internally instead acquiring other companies to bolster their product lines temporarily while showing no faith in existing engineering teams. Senior leadership would not support the suggestions that were needed to resolve issues, especially with acquired companies. D&I was a meaningful program focused on policy, benefits, and was supposed to offer a path to leadership skills and promotions. Now it is just words. The real programs no longer offer hope to employees and are used for marketing to investors and colleges."

F5,2.0,"Mar 31, 2022",stuck in the past in too many ways,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"you may get a good manager or good teammates. 
the company does some D&I messaging.
you may get a chance to learn a lot in some roles.","the cons grew to outweigh the pros by far. reviews on here suspiciously went up by 0.5 stars out of no where. notice all the positive reviews that have very little information in them. dont believe them.

extremely low pay across the board for most teams unless youre a manager or above.
going against the status quo is often ignored or frowned up. 
a lot of sr managers have very traditional views about how a company should be run in the bad way.
no true milestone rewards unless you work there for 10yrs which shows how little your time is valued.
many teams are under resourced which means people get burnt out quickly and then leave, creaing often a long unending cycle.
lots of outsourcing to exploit cheap labor.
didnt give raises to most ppl during the pandemic except to the top.
too much nepotism leading to too many unqualified leaders ruining departments.
tries to behave like a startup which doesnt work for a 25+yr old company with over 6000 employees. just means internal systems are messy and lots of instructions arent documented.
too many outdated systems and ways of doing things.

the list could go on. please do yourself a favor and listen to these words. unless youre getting a rare competitive offer to be a sr mgr or are escaping somewhere even worse to use this place as a stepping stone it isnt worth it."

Talent Acquisition straight up lies to you about the culture and people when hiring you just to get you onboard. Experienced many situations where diversity and inclusion were not supported or encouraged. Everyone thinks they are the smartest and is trying to prove it, not a collaborative environment that celebrates people’s diverse experiences."
