BlackBerry,2.0,"Mar 4, 2024",Sadly its a sinking ship...,Territory Account Manager,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"Good benefits. Decent pay. Middle Management. Some talented people. 

Cylance AI/ML is a solid technology - but needs to be updated.

New CEO, John G, is a positive as John Chen did nothing to drive growth.

BB QNX technology for the auto industry is solid.","BB has destroyed both the Cylance brand recognition and product innovation. After I came aboard I lost 50% of my clients as they wouldn't renew - they went to S1 or CrowdStrike. I was told that MGT would revive the Cylance brand and aggressively market our cybersecurity solutions - neither of these things happened. 

Channel partners have abandoned Cylance. The big resellers/partners consider Cylance a non-factor and they are not even part of the discussion. Senior Leadership has done nothing to address this. 

Employee morale is incredibly low. 

Senior Management was horrific under John Chen (old CEO). John still believed that the Blackberry brand is strong in the world - it may be in Canada but not elsewhere. When I asked random people they said either ""I though BB was out of business"" or ""..you guys make cell phones...I really liked mine...."" JC knows little to nothing about cybersecurity and constantly waffled in his decisions - he should have retired after saving the company from bankruptcy."
BlackBerry,1.0,"Dec 6, 2023",A Sinking Ship In Desperation Mode,Enterprise Account Executive,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",,Some amazing coworkers that worked hard and wanted to succeed in spite of the continuous obstacles presented. Innovative and unique technology that was unfortunately squandered by poor leadership decisions.,"Branding and market awareness are terrible to non-existent. Marketing dollars spent are a fraction of the competition and Blackberry is still basically known as ""the phone company"".

Delusional and inept senior leadership has created the worst sales culture I've ever encountered. Completely disconnected from the realities/difficulties on the ground and stuck in a 1990's-early 2000's mindset. New logos are all but non-existent here, and existing customers are and have been leaving in droves since Blackberry acquired Cylance in 2019. If you do not have a decent existing account base (and most territories at this point don't), your chances of being successful are slim to none. None of this, however, stops senior leadership from unrealistic expectations with ludicrous timelines.

Channel relationships have been long-abandoned and discarded. The big players have long ago abandoned Cylance (Blackberry) to where the company is a non-factor and not even part of the discussion. Leadership has done nothing to address this, and in fact, has worsened the problem by burning bridges of what remained in desperation for short-term wins that resulted in permanently fractured partnerships."
BlackBerry,2.0,"Oct 30, 2023",Not a horrible workplace but inability to deliver with toxic leadership enabled by HR,Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"Great colleagues, benefits not bad. Working for Blackberry can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on where you are in your career. Good if you have less experience. It's a software company with security in its name.","Blackberry is behind the curve in terms of technology and culture. When you're ready to move on, recruiters may raise doubts about your career choice of working for BlackBerry. Low pay, the executive leadership is a mess. Not able to deliver new software. High turnover of COOs in recent years. Executive leadership culture is the worst I have ever experienced. I witnessed one executive bashed another executive of minority background using inappropriate remark, and in other occasions there were remarks not respectful to women. In my own experience, HR sided with poor leadership in a way that to this day it's hard to comprehend. There was teachable moment that HR could have turned into rather than showing strong hands unnecessarily. The industry is moving towards a more humane culture. Their HR should catch up."

The weight of the sales team is carried by the renewals team because they struggle to sell to net new. By milking the renewals team as the cash cow they become very troublesome to their existing customer base.. The current sales leadership has a hard time using basic tools like Salesforce. You will get yelled at, you will be accused of insubordination if you wish to work from home, and no one has your back. It's the most toxic job I've ever held and hard to trust anyone in leadership positions. There was no opportunity for career advancement, I was stuck in the same position for over five years. Never once promoted. All I can say is that it is very chaotic, and you should stay away from this company if you value your mental health."

Endless toilet flush of Marketing executives each promising to sell and one even going as far as to say ""This product isn't great - but we can still sell it"" - great confidence booster. This company is smoke and mirrors - great website, great marketing, but clinging to an old brand and trying to flip a bad product onto its customers."

Salary is median level. Benefits are standard.","Other business unit (cybersecurity) is making large losses. The Company has publicly announced measures that could meant it splitting up or being acquired. A company struggling to ditch an image synonymous with failure and complacency in its former smartphone business. Very disjointed product portfolios - between its QNX branded products and its BlackBerry branded products. Websites are testimony to this. Very ‘engineering led’ with strong egos amongst its product and engineering leaders; marketing despite having the budgets, struggles to impose leadership and get recognized, despite lip service and some attempts to the contrary. CEO townhall meetings are excruciatingly depressing, with the cyber business being public ally lambasted in front of everyone. It’s clear sone of the old QNX stalwarts resented becoming part of BkackBerry. Lots of people with a Director title who are not really directors. Directors report to directors… Ottawa building is a hangar-like, soulless place, with grey high cubicles, lacking energy or creativity. Staffed by very in-the-weeds computer science/engineering types who develop real time operating systems and related software that lives deep in the heart of embedded systems computers. Apparently high calorie snacks and sparse fresh fruit makes it a good place… Cafeteria mediocre. No Friday celebrations; alcohol strictly forbidden anyways. Too much process where it’s outdated and not needed; not enough where there should be."

BlackBerry,1.0,"Jul 24, 2023",Never work here,Senior DevOps Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Portland, OR","Relatively easy job technically, some good team mates.","The frequent reorgs within the company have created an atmosphere of chaos and uncertainty. Paired with a lack of effective project management and clear direction, the environment has hindered productivity and made it difficult to focus on delivering quality work. Additionally, I have found that the company's support for individual employees' needs has been extremely lacking, which has affected morale and motivation, and led to many people quitting. Now is my time to do the same. The forcing of a return to the office has been a significant source of tension for me for a while now. When I joined Blackberry, it was explicitly under the understanding that remote work would be accommodated, which was a critical factor in my decision to join. The lack of consideration for this need and the insistence on returning to the office despite my concerns have been deeply disappointing and ultimately the primary reason for my resignation. Furthermore, I must express my dissatisfaction with the HR and Benefits teams at Blackberry. Over the years, I have encountered numerous issues with their level of support and professionalism. One particularly frustrating incident was when I discovered that the Kaiser insurance option, which I was promised and specifically sought out when I joined, was not initially available to me. It took months of fighting and advocating for my rights to finally secure the insurance option I was offered in my employment contract. This was ridiculous. This experience, along with many others over the years, has left me feeling unsupported and very frustrated with the lack of transparency and accountability within the company's HR and benefits departments. Throughout my time at Blackberry, I have often felt like nothing more than a number to the corporate executives. The anxiety and stress I have endured due to their inability to effectively run the company have been overwhelming. It has become increasingly evident that the organization is facing significant struggles and is on the verge of decline. Unfortunately, the corporate culture and leadership have failed to address these challenges adequately, resulting in a toxic work environment that undermines the potential for success. I can only hope that people can leave on their own terms before the company forces them to. As a disabled queer, trans non-binary, and autistic person, I expected the bare minimum from Blackberry in terms of inclusivity and provide a supportive environment in all aspects of my employment. Even that was too much of an ask, as the company has fallen short in nearly every aspect. There is a significant lack of understanding, support, and inclusivity for individuals like myself, as well as more broadly. Blackberry has the potential to do so much better, but it appears unwilling to make the necessary changes."

They did not deserve what happened to them. I am fortunate to have already moved on before the company was sold,Company CEO sold to BlackBerry for half of what it was worth. Screwed employees out of common stock options they earned and worked years for.
BlackBerry,2.0,"Mar 8, 2023",Great Products - Great People - that no one has heard of ...,Sales Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","New York, NY",BlackBerry has some great people and great technology. Benefits are adequate to good. Product portfolio is good. Minimal travel. 401K Match. Good Work life balance.,"BlackBerry has an market awareness problem. The legacy name is a hindrance in moving forward. Everyone has heard of the company for the wrong reasons. Corporate and public awareness is very weak. BlackBerry will always be known as the CELL-PHONE Company whose best days have gone bye. The purchase of Good Technology and Cylance saved the company. However, managerial decisions to kill off these brand names hurt the former brands. BlackBerry still owns products that should have been sold off or EOL'ed. Sales commissions are mostly unachievable. In general, there is no incentive to keep current accounts - as there is typically no Sales Commission on keeping an account (Renewals). High turn over. Company has no interest in maintaining employees. Stock Options to employees are extremely rare. Company has been on a ""no-spend"" budget for years. Company looks for every reason not to pay out commissions. Company doesn't know how or have the ability or willingness to market itself. Company does not believe in Sales Incentives - (Club) Most Regional & National Sales meetings are via zoom - This is a company that still has the mindset that they are the BB of old. Some one forgot to tell them that they are no longer on top of the food chain or relevant."

BlackBerry,4.0,"Jan 21, 2023",Job stability is questionable,Senior Architect,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","London, England","There are some great engineers and industry experts in the company, to work with. Some even are at the ISO/IEEE standard advisory boards, creating/maintaining standards, for Industrial use. The talent pool and slew of work assignments are attractive to work for.","There are not many engineering projects to actively contribute in the U.K. region esp. the automotive sector. Most of the work is getting done by North American teams and lack of own participation (job allocation) may prove monotonous at times. Also, technical resources are not reshuffled across departments, rather the job positions tend to abolish from the Org hierarchy. In short, job stability isn't assured and is not even based on performance."
