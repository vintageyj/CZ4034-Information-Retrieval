- Poor equipment budget. Current laptop has an old i5 processor with only 8 GB of RAM. Not enough to do my job when running Office 365, Teams, Webex, Docker, VSCode, and everything else.
- Very uncertain future. Intrado is in the process of dividing the company up and selling the pieces. 
- Very poor inter-department communication. There is too many migrations happening at once and things are starting to collide into each other which is blocking entire dev teams. 
- On Call. This is probably the worst aspect. Expect to get called late at least once or twice if you're on call for the week. Some weeks are better than others, but things seem to break too often."

The saboteur is the person who undermines your every move letting you how terrible you are to the others, and strongly associated to that is gatekeeper bully who misdirects you and with hold resources preventing you from becoming more proficient in your duties.

My direct supervisor is fantastic and my team of co-workers are great to work with. I enjoy my current role in the company and look forward to coming to work on a daily basis.,"I feel that Intrado Life & Safety does not try to retain talented individuals in a niche market where I believe employee retention is very important because ramp up times to be self sufficient in many of the roles require 6 months or more on the job. Also I feel the large pay bands that overlap positions leave little incentive to try to obtain promotions as most employees that I know of have received a 5% or less for a significant increase in job responsibilities with the promotion. The pay should be according to the job responsibilities, not a small percentage increase on what the employee was previously making. Many positions lack upward mobility/advancement and switching departments within the company is the only way to advance. I also think that this company at the current moment is not offering competitive salaries. I know that I could leave and have a higher offer by at least $20,000."

- you have to sign onto a phone line. it's like a call center where clients can call in to request website updates.
- you have to clock in your time. for each client request, you need to record it.
- a book of 60-70 clients.
- ops role but you do account management meetings with clients.

Intrado has good benefits overall. Working from home has rocked, even if it was for a bad reason, and talk of continuing at least a modified version is promising.","Due to RIFs and attrition there are less people doing the same amount of work in some areas and it can be frustrating and exhausting. Creates the feeling of not being able to take time off because someone else could be overwhelmed with the work load. I don't think the compensation is where it should be to compare/compete on a national scale for the ""entry"" level positions and it makes it harder for Intrado to hire quality people."

Lots of freedom as long as you get your work done. Industry leading time off (for now). Those with talent are promoted. Almost everyone outside of corporate West are great people that really care.,"I worked at Intrado for about 8 years. In that amount of time I struggle to come up with a single thing that has improved. Ever since West and Apollo took over they have slowly bled the company dry. 401k basically cut in half, PTO rebranded as vacation/sick so they don't have to pay it out when you quit or get laid off. Consistent layoffs to teams that are already extremely short staffed. There is a huge disconnect between folks working in the Longmont office and corporate. Corporate acts as overlords and we were all just along for the ride. Pay is laughably low considering being located in one of the most expensive counties in the country. It's a shame that West/Apollo has turned legacy Intrado into what it is today. People quitting in bunches and for good reason. Lots more hanging on, hoping that an eventual sale will make things better."

That is very clearly reflected in their culture. This is a company that will lie directly to your face about everything. It's currently going into a firesale, because the good 'ol boys have completely and utterly failed in trying to modernize any of their company. It's being parted out and sold for scrap like a stolen car. The management is also full of absolutely creepy men who try creep on younger women. The pay is garbage and the culture is somehow worse."

I am an avid overseas travel, and now I'm (literally!!) stuck at home because of lack of mobility, which has not been the case with previous companies for which I worked over the past 16 years. Being that this is a communications company, mobility is their second nature = this capacity should also be extended to their employees. In this day and age, it's probably forbidden to consider not to be able work from a laptop. I look forward to be able to either receive/trade my work desktop for a laptop so that I can resume my overseas travels while I continue doing my work, just as I have done for so many years."

At Intrado Digital Media, which recently rebranded as Notified, it's overwhelmingly, overflowingly encouraging and positive. 90 days in and I truly feel that I can be here at least 3 years (and even more, of course), primarily because of how I feel about the support of my supervisor, other leads and colleagues. There's positive vibes all around, and the work itself ... well, it's definitely for the editorially minded who hate typos and assorted mistakes in press releases. I also personally enjoy speaking with clients, and the volume of the calls is not like call centers, so the balance of editing and answering phones/making calls/sending emails is ideal.","For anyone coming from reporting or editing where the *byline* mattered, this is a different kind of shop.

Poor support. I know of one senior level manager who would walk around each morning and say something to all of his reports that he had something in common with (schools, churches, family members) and literally walk past other employees without saying hello.
Poor raises. Averaged 1-3%. 
Company required managers to find something to rate employees down on during yearly reviews. Even if employees were stellar in all of their responsibilities, they could not get an excellent review.
For some reason, the managers encouraged teams to work within themselves and not reach out to other employees with expertise that could be provided. Set up rivalries."

Intrado/West employees were treated well prior to the acquisition and bonus incentives were offered based on your contribution to the bottom line. Once Apollo took leadership the financial greed overshadowed the positive environment and poor business decisions were made that created a significant loss in clients. As clients began leaving the employees saw the writing on the wall and the talent left in droves.

West Technology Group,2.0,"Jul 19, 2021",Corporate,Technical Resource Specialist,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Mobile, AL",Consistent paycheck and Cool coworkers.,"Technicians get the most of the work and get the least pay. Company has been sold and has become completely corporate. They only look at numbers in paper and don’t look at the scope of work that is necessary on the technicians end. Technicians are micro managed while other teams who do less work and get paid more get excuses made for them. If you’re a good employee they continue to pile work on you while mediocre employees get a pass. They will use the “you’re so great at this” as an excuse and want you to take a compliment meanwhile they don’t compensate with money. Compliments do not pay bills, it’s not a compliment. It’s insulting."
