Can’t think of anything else that’s nice","The turnover rate especially for marketing team is extremely high. All the new people that joined barely stayed for a year and left. Company goes through restructuring very often. They were not able to higher senior manager to cover the ones that left for more than a year and expect remaining staff to cover the role without proper compensation. Executives & Senior Executives without managers are expected to do managerial duties, have managerial expectations set on them but they’re not willing to compensate fairly. Every time someone leaves from the team, instead of getting proper replacement so that the team work load is balance and well-managed, it is stressed on the remaining staff and often told to staff that this is a “learning opportunity”. Over work culture is celebrated. Staff that is willing to work till night, weekends, are the staff that they like & those that set boundaries for themselves are deemed as not performing to their expectations. Marketing team leader loves to send emails and whatsapp late into the night because that’s when she checks her email. Love to set meetings with staff without proper agenda or expectations laid out on what the meetings are for. 1-1 meetings are just to update workload instead of talking about employee development, goals etc. “Leader” thrives on being extremely busy and overwork, you see her running around from 1 meeting to another everyday and have to wait at her desk after office hours if you need to ask her anything urgent. A company filled with employees that are just there sitting and waiting for retirement and new younger staffs barely last more than 1 year. A high blame culture where something goes wrong or a mistake is made, then that person will be remembered and blame for that mistake forever. Senior managers love to gossip about the members of the team. HUGE clique culture, if you’re not part of their clique then trust that they will talk ill about you and you can kiss promotion goodbye because it depends on whether they like you or not. Loves to gossip and talk about the people that left and make them the problem even though nearly 6-7 staff from the team left within just the first half of 2023. And the ones that left don’t get replaced so the workload gets pass down even down to executive level functioning without a manager. Think twice before joining especially if you’re just thinking of joining due to its company name, FUJIFILM. It’s not a tech company even though they try so hard to be one but they can never function or even be on par as other companies due to backward thinking, messy management + toxic culture. Let’s not forget they love to be called a happy family. So think for yourself."
