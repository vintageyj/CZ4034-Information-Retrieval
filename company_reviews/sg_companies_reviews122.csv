Razer,1.0,"Sep 19, 2023",No...Just noo,Marketing,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Singapore,You love gaming and wanna make it your life? ..enjoy it while it last.,"I must say that this place broke my heart. Being an avid gamer and a fan of the brand, there are individuals here who will kill your soul and love for the work and the brand in general. If you are looking for a job here, just makesure you have nerves of steel as some people are clever at politicking their way around the system and even somehow making their way to the top.  Razer Gold B2C, the head looks down on others . You should only look at the turnover of staff under their purview to gauge how they operate. The mean and rude people in the company outweighs the kind and supportive ones, so prepared to either be yelled at and learn to live in a toxic environment. I just want to let Razer know that they have effectively killed my passion for the gaming industry.

I beg you, think twice."

Everyone is nice and work together to be #1 in the business. They provide lunch and snacks, lots of team bonding, and employee well being exercises. Lots of transparency from the top down, too. CEO openly shares business forecast.","Lacking work/life balance. Most employees have to work with Singapore, which results in late night meetings. This is not sustainable. They’re also numbers driven and always looking at P&L. There’s a big push to meet KPIs, which is necessary, but in some cases expectations are unreasonable."
Razer,1.0,"Aug 16, 2023",Very asian culture with all kinds of harasment,Senior Marketing Specialist,Current Employee,,"Got employee discount (but actually not big different from shopee flash deal), got health insurance coverred, got office and 100% need to work from there (do have ad-hoc option for wfh but depends on your manager)","Not transparant for most of the internal communication at all. A lot of work harasment like people manager shout or swear words just because of some idea conflicts. Non of the HR teams can help at all because the company CEO also the same. Request employees do 120% work but they turn off the aircon by 6:27pm everyday to reduce the budget, and principle is not allow work from home. They done restructure on 2022 and retrenched many managers from the team, and after one whole year still no replacement but just keep asking the rest of the team member supporting, no any salary raise and not to mention they even ask all to take non-paid leave by each month that time.

- Firedrill environment: ""when everything is important, nothing is important"" Drop everything and attend to the fire of the day.. The direction and priorities from leadership (if communicated) changes on a weekly basis with no north-star, concrete game plan established. 

- Lack of setting up employees to succeed: prepare to learn a lot on your own and through mistakes, as you will wing everything blindly. There is not one page of any training anywhere to be found (e.g. everything is local knowledge), good luck!

- Work-life balance: since Razer is based in Singapore, work can begin later (8AM-9:30AM, SoCal laid back start) and goes to 7PM-11PM PST 2-4 nights a week (not a maybe, a guarantee)."
