Good salary
Interesting clients and super helpful products with a great reputation
Reasonable, though not exactly generous, PTO","Business trajectory is highly uncertain, given the number of T1 retailers either going under or slashing spend. 
-Zebra execs may not want to admit it, but the company clearly spent recklessly during the pandemic and the bloat has never been more obvious than in recent months
-Work-life balance is something many employees have only ever heard of
-Jaw-dropping, disturbing, and infuriating amounts of favoritism and nepotism, especially when it comes to promotions and career advancement
-If you’re hired as a specialist, be prepared to remain one for a LONG time. Management promotions are far and few between, and the rare opptys that do become available often go to the hiring managers’ buddies. Sabotaging/undermining qualified employees to clear the way for friends is definitely not unheard of…
-Questionable accountability, as leaders of consistently underperforming teams rarely seem to face any consequences or executive intervention (again, could also speak to favoritism)
-Layoffs have left a wake of paranoia, grief and confusion that is still lingering
-Slipping morale - never seems to be any genuinely good news coming from C-level, only (slightly) silver-lined clouds
-Some teams (or entire divisions) are incredibly cliquey, especially post-acquisitions, and make it very difficult to fit in. My division was once a great, welcoming, fun, inclusive place to work — until we inherited a large number of employees from an acquisition. The acquired product quickly became a top revenue generator, and as a result, all employees who’d come from that acquisition were held in the highest regard (to the point of pampering). Eventually the blatant double standards, chauvinism, entitlement, favoritism, and other unprofessional behaviors while leadership literally sat back and watched turned the environment toxic"

It's worth noting that the salaries here tend to be below the current market standards for similar roles. This observation isn't unique to Zebra and is a challenge faced by many organizations in today's competitive job market.

The Product team is blindfolded as the information has to pass through this manager who is of no use. Absolute use less personexcept to celebrate parties,drink beer, jolly living and fun loving. Not even worth of setting proper goals an defending reportees, nor to talk in a meeting. A rosy picture on the compensation front but delays probation,or dis approves benefits, certification reimbursement, diversifies the bonus to other key pets like female Engineering managers.
