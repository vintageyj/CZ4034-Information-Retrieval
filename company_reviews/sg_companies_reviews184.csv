Good amount of time off after 5 years.,"There’s little opportunity for advancement. Managers don’t promote advancement. Xerox heavily leans on temp contract workers during a time when it’s a employee market, meaning quality will be lacking. This year Xerox didn’t provide a good method for tracking vacation time. Poor communication. Xerox pay is poor. I was “promoted” to site manager, a hand shake promotion. Meaning given the extra responsibility with no official promotion. I’ve stayed at the same level. They did nothing for my coworker for her 30th work anniversary except for a pin. 30 years, nothing. In 8 years they’ve only removed benefits, not added any. They’ve also put managers on several accounts. Meaning I have 2 managers who I haven’t actually seen in several weeks. If things seem to be going ok, they focus on accounts that are falling apart. My operation manager’s only knowledge about how my account is doing is just what I tell him. There used to be a manager on site most of the time. This keeps people on task better. Also, I could leave this company now and make more money in a lesser position with a lot of other print companies."

Overwhelming Training: The extensive and overwhelming online training, particularly on outdated printers, may not align with the company's future direction.

Xerox,1.0,"Dec 13, 2023",Bad News,Process Specialist,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Webster, NY","I guess there's job security, considering how many people voluntary leave this position so quickly.","The pay is mediocre, the schedule is absolutely atrocious - it is rotating day/night schedule, which rotates EVERY WEEK, literally the worst frequency for such a drastic rotation. Additionally, despite working 48 hours per week every week, management was able to manipulate the schedule in such a way where half the weeks worked would yield no overtime (half of the weeks would be 48 hours, the other half 36). They absolutely knew what they were doing. It's even worse considering how high the profit margins are (or at least were) on this product. Obviously, they don't care at all about their employees in the slightest.

Then there's many employees themselves. When I was there, the toner specialists were almost completely divided into two groups (with rare exception) - kids just getting out of college with no prior full time work experience, and old disgruntled laid off Kodak employees. The former group was what I was part of, and consisted of a lot of good people. The latter was much more problematic. While some of the older workers were fine, many were unbelievably nasty. Racism, homophobia, and sexism ran rampant to a degree that I have never seen at any other job. I worked at L3Harris after this - I am not exaggerating when I say that many of these guys would've been walked out the door within weeks of being hired there. But the Xerox toner plant not only tolerated it - they promoted many of these guys. When people say that Xerox hasn't adapted to the 21st century, they mean it in every possible way."

I’ve had stellar reviews my entire time with company, and served multiple roles beyond the scope of my job when the account struggled. Despite this, my last days with Xerox did not include a single thank you for my service throughout the years, and I was ushered out the door like the outgoing mail.
