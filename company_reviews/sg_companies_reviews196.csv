Cerner,1.0,"Jan 12, 2024",Worst employment experience EVER,Change Implementation Analyst,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Kansas City, MO",The opportunity to work from home was the best thing about this role.,"Don't report training issues or you will be fired. I agree with a previous comment that this is not a good place for minorities (in my opinion); specifically Black Americans. These people required me to repeat a training class that I'd already completed and passed 8 months prior because they didn't want to provide adequate mentor assistance (something they claimed would be available when requested). Their reason for me repeating? Because I had complained about the previous training session, although I wasn't the only person who had complained. However, I was the only employee required to repeat the session. I was even told (by a manager) that my comments might ""offend the mentors who had worked hard on the training material"". Then, to add insult to injury, I was terminated the day after I was told that I had done a good job on the completion of my second training session. Management is incompetent and gets offended when asked about job scenarios he/she doesn't understand, yet expects the less experienced employee to understand the same material. Mentors would either ignore requests for assistance or postpone it. I even had one mentor to ask if he could postpone assisting me so that he could help his friend with his resume. You may ask, ""Why didn't you report it?"" Remember....reporting issues will only get you fired... It's already been proven..."
Cerner,4.0,"Feb 4, 2024",Great People/Hard to advance career,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,,I worked at Cerner for almost 8 years in various roles. The best part of working here was the people I worked with. I loved my coworkers and have even stayed close with them years after leaving the company.,"The pay is notoriously stingy, especially for entry-level positions. If you happen to get hired on in one of those positions be prepared to one of the lowest paid associates if you end up moving to a different department. I was in a senior position after working there for 5 years and I was mentoring new associates who were making more than I was who were just hired on. Could be different now that Oracle owns Cerner."
