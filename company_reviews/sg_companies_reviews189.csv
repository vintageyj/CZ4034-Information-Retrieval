Unisys,3.0,"Feb 25, 2024",Typical soulless multinational company with lower pay than the competition,Senior Service Desk Agent,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Budapest,"- Full Home Office if you live more than Xkm away from the office
- Company sponsored certifications such as ITIL V4 Foundation and Comptia A+ after a year with the company
- Private healthcare after 1 year with the company
- You might get a role in your team which is not monitored closely (or at all) and you get away with doing the bare minimum (due to bad management)","- Much lower salary compared to the competition in Budapest
- Raises are only a point of discussion if you are trying to leave the company, otherwise don't even dream
- Workload can be a lot depending on the account you are supporting
- No feedback = Good feedback
- Seniors with several years of experience earn the same or (in my case) less, than people who join the company today
- Useless internal trainings that they push a lot
- Typical pointless Workday goal setting every once in a while
- You only get different positions if you befriend your current leaders, or threaten to leave after being with them for a couple of years"

Recognition is pathetic to the point of absurd hilarity, often involving spam e-cards of no monetary value whatsoever!

Expect to be a jack-of-all-trades, to ""wing-it"" until you can convince yourself you're a subject matter expert enough to convince your clients.

Employee benefits quite literally consist of one single item; which is a solid EPA partner; ironically the only reason you really need the EPA is for them to counsel you on the trauma of your employment.

The company needs a massive thought-overhaul, and as it's refusing to do it voluntarily, it will happen through external forces (such as major partners looking elsewhere)"
