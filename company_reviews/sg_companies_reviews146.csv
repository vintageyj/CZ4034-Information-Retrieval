Sage,2.0,"Mar 7, 2024","Soul sucking, painful, and toxic",Sales Manager,Former Employee,,The medical and well care benefits were the most positive aspect at Sage.,"I am sad to share how terrible my experience was at Sage. It was a toxic, pressure cooker with managers who were narcissistic, manipulative, and volatile. I did not want to write such a negative review but I have to in order to have others considering employment here to hopefully avoid the pain. There was so much emphasis on DEI but numerous times when there was blatant ageism. I can't emphasize it enough that you will be discriminated against if you are on the older side. Sage changed the comp plan where we could only earn commissions twice a year and had quotas that were almost impossible to attain. It's such a shame to share these details because there are some very nice people who work there. I don't miss the verbal abuse, the manipulations, unachievable goals, and unrealistic expectations. I feel sorry for those who have to still suffer there. We all deserve better. It didn't have to be so terrible with such shameful behavior at times. Sarah McCune would be so disappointed if she knew how her company is behind the curtains."
Sage,2.0,"Feb 7, 2024",Good Place to work but things seem questionable now,Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Newcastle upon Tyne, England","Benefits overall are good

Interesting work for developers using latest tech

Good processes in place

A lot of developers are passionate about creating innovative solutions","There have been a number of major missteps by senior leadership including:

Team agreements - this one is set by senior leadership and teams are told to comply not agree. So much so it's used as part of the review process (how a team agreement can determine how well someone has done is beyond me). I agree that time in the office and collaboration is a good thing, but the amount of time spent should be decided by the teams themselves not senior management who want bums on seats

""High performance culture"" - this one cracks me up personally. The CEO is giving all hands meetings talking about this while there are audio and video issues in said meetings. There is also a lot of middle to higher management who seem to not be doing a lot of work and instead impose themselves on others (directors etc).

We have now been informed of potential redundancies and restructuring etc, which kind of makes the above 2 now make sense. 

I personally think redundancies are counter active to a high performance culture. If you want the products Sage create to improve and involve you have to keep your high performers and keep them happy. You seem to be doing the opposite of that at the moment"
Sage,3.0,"Feb 28, 2024",Expect constant change and no delivery on goals,Product Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Newcastle upon Tyne, England","Good salary, good annual bonus, access to great benefits.","Constantly shifting priorities, senior leadership's heads turned by shiny new toys every 6 months, causing chaos for people trying to deliver software. This isn't in relation to the changing landscape of accounting, it's just bad planning and lack of foresight.

No product leadership - Chief Product Officer appears once a year and then vanishes until the next financial year kicks off. I have no idea what his views are on anything, have no sense of his strategy for the organisation and makes no attempt to foster any sense of cohesion as a product function.

As people begin to return to the office, facilities are starting to feel the strain. Impossible to get a seat at lunch if you turn up at 12:01, I've seen people eating lunch stood with food propped on a windowsill and others eating in the ""break out"" call pods meant for having private Teams calls.

Many colleagues feeling the same sense of disconnection, misery and isolation. Sage is currently promoting ""high performance mentality"" but making no fundamental changes to the core problems that are causing low performance."
Sage,3.0,"Feb 19, 2024",Great culture but subpar pay,Account Executive,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Lawrenceville, GA","I appreciate the culture at Sage—it fosters a fantastic work/life balance, and the flexibility in schedules is a significant plus. The inclusion of community service paid time off adds an extra layer of balance, making it an overall enriching experience.","The compensation falls on the lower side of the standard pay scale for this role. Frequent budget cuts, particularly targeting the marketing budget, can impact the ability to maintain a robust pipeline. Additionally, there is a lack of well-established standard operating processes within the organization."
Sage,1.0,"Feb 27, 2024",Failing leadership,Inside Sales,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Manchester, England",Some of my colleagues & health cover.,"Company direction is taking a nose-dive & dragging culture to an all time low as all executives care about is profit nowadays. The good people are leaving & now the best exec we had has left the business - the last person we had to look up to. Enter mediocrity & a senior leadership team that cares nothing for the people or the culture. The HR team don’t care & help sweep reports of misconduct by SLT under the carpet & engrain the failing culture. Product don’t listen to customers or sales & they churn out features that don’t work or lacks innovation. I’ve done OK at Sage, so I hold no grudges, but know I need to leave as the company & the product are running towards a hard fail & zero faith left in current exec team to turn this around. Very disappointing."
Sage,3.0,"Feb 26, 2024","Short stint, not for the long term",Marketing Executive,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","London, England","Great culture between colleagues, lots of talented and passionate people, respectable bonus and share scheme, some good perks.","Pay is always lacking, you will feel as if you’re always paid slightly less than the work you’re doing deserves. Be prepared for random layoffs of whole teams as leadership arbitrarily restructure every 9 months. Currently the company is massively understaffed by design, whist we are told to be ‘high performance’ aka do the work of the teams we just fired for no extra pay or title. There is a real issue within certain teams of unwillingness to help and some heads of departments are actively detrimental to the roles of people who report into them.
Best to do 1-2 years to get the experience and hop to another company."
Sage,5.0,"Mar 1, 2024",Really positive environment,Copywriter,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Manchester, England","I'm lucky to work in a really positive team, with a focus on self development and constructive criticism. Everyone is working towards the same goal and when i hear of more toxic work environments I appreciate working somewhere that understands we are human, and work is only a part of our lives, not all of it. I recently utilised the work away scheme which is a major perk for me.","It was disheartening to see that the gender pay gap has grown in recent years in the latest report. It seems nothing is being done to rectify that. 
On a smaller note, although it is the same in most modern offices, is that they're too cold (usually designed for men who are naturally hotter) I love my office days to collaborate with the team (although love the hybrid best of both worlds setup) but sometimes I'm cold to the point of distraction."
Sage,4.0,"Sep 22, 2023","The work remains good, but what was a positive, people-focused culture is evapourating",Associate Developer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Newcastle upon Tyne, England","My team are great! Since joining I've worked with some absolutely great people, who are properly supportive, know their stuff, always have time to jump on a call and talk over a problem. I've also been part of super exciting projects, with what feels like very new tech and solutions. I've taken up more and more responsibility and feel I've really grown a lot in my short time here so far.","The culture isn't what it used to be... I used to find communication from the higher ups regular, honest and transparent. Now it's super mirky. I feel big decisions and changes come out of nowhere. It's not a massive deal, but it's definitely changed the feel/culture. I don't think I trust the EVPs, VPs and Cs anymore. Best example of this is progression. People keep asking when the hiring freeze will be lifted, and the response is always along the lines of ""there is no freeze on hiring/progression and never has been"". This is the party line that people are being told to say, but the reality is that my team lead (and many others across the company) have been pushing for progressions for over a year and keep getting palmed off. So, the situation is that either the Directors, EVPs and other high ups who sit above my team lead simply don't actually have the clout to push a progression through (which would be worrying at that level), or we're just being straight up lied to."
Sage,5.0,"Mar 4, 2024",Exceptional Work Environment and Supportive Management at Sage!,Site Reliability Engineer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Newcastle upon Tyne, England","I am writing to express my heartfelt appreciation for the incredible work culture and management support at Sage. As a recent graduate SRE, my experience with Sage has been nothing short of remarkable, and I feel compelled to share the positive impact it has had on my professional journey.

First and foremost, Sage has introduced me to a work-life balance that I never knew was possible. The emphasis on maintaining a healthy equilibrium between work and personal life has greatly contributed to my overall well-being. This has not only enhanced my job satisfaction but has also allowed me to bring my best self to the workplace each day.

The management at Sage deserves commendation for their exceptional leadership and unwavering support. The team's commitment to fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment is truly inspiring. I have found the management to be approachable, understanding, and always ready to assist. Their proactive stance in ensuring that every team member is engaged and motivated is a testament to their dedication to employee growth and satisfaction.

One aspect that sets Sage apart is the dynamic and stimulating work environment. I appreciate how the management actively works to prevent monotony and ensures that no day is like the other. This commitment to variety and challenge has fuelled my motivation to continuously learn and grow within the company.

Moreover, the opportunities for professional development and learning are abundant at Sage. The encouragement to take on new challenges, coupled with the ample resources provided for skill enhancement, has been instrumental in my personal and career growth.

In conclusion, I am genuinely grateful to be a part of the Sage family. The positive atmosphere, the supportive management, and the focus on employee well-being have made my transition into the professional world seamless and enjoyable. I look forward to contributing my best to Sage's success while continuing to grow both personally and professionally.

Thank you for providing an exceptional workplace that fosters growth, collaboration, and well-being.","No cons, all positive, great job team!."
Sage,2.0,"Oct 17, 2023",Not as good as it used to be,Senior Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","Newcastle upon Tyne, England","Good benefits, decent pay, decent bonus if your face fits and your product sells. Office canteen is ok and reasonably priced.","The whims of management can be quite demotivational at times. They were fantastic over lockdown, but the mandated return to office is silly when we've recruited colleagues who live a long way from the offices and were recruited on the basis that they didn't need to go into an office. Now they're told they must, so we're losing good people. There's many teams which have only one person in a particular office and there's immense pressure for them to go into the office and sit on their own. Why? Management decisions are rarely communicated well. We get extensive communications on irrelevant matters, but don't get to hear about decisions that actually impact us until after they've been implemented. The back-filling of empty roles has both been frozen for most teams. This means that existing colleagues are having to take up the load which is causing more people to want to leave. There's also heavy restrictions on progressions which means that external companies are taking our good colleagues easily. The new head office lacks soul. North Park was much better and it's a shame we didn't upgrade it. Starbucks run the coffee shop when we used to have a small, high quality independent coffee shop in the office. Sage used to be the champion of small businesses! We used to be flexible on working compressed hours and a number of colleagues went onto this arrangement. Newer colleagues aren't being allowed to do compressed hours and this is just causing resentment."
Sage,2.0,"Dec 19, 2023","Great colleagues, bad management",Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,,I really had a good colleagues in the team I was in. I really enjoyed working with them and they are great people. I also enjoyed days such as Sage Foundation. Sage also has strong financial results.,"The management was not great because they cared about results and not their employees. Highly stressful role with no reward such as career progression. Particularly, crazy goals set by managers that were unattainable because I had my own work to do that I was hired for as well as goals not related to my job in order to justify my promotion. Even when these goals I believed I met after high stress, they were argued by my manager I did not meet them. I moved on from the company to be at the level I knew I was at and I've not been happier. 
I didn't enjoy working here, it was full of stress and a toxic environment by managers and higher ups. I didn't feel the company kept to their own culture and values and I felt it was more a façade. I didn't have time for training too. I heard from different teams being worried of terminations because of their skills being on the more outdated side which they used to develop their product whilst their same product was being re-made in the new tech stack with a new team instead of retraining the old team. I found management to be very backstab."
Sage,3.0,"Nov 14, 2023","Amazing if you're in the flagship products, lost at sea otherwise",Product Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Winnersh, England","- Excellent benefits coverage (from what I've heard, always above competitors) - Finally a clearer view of invested products and the strategy of ""selling Sage"" to customers for the future - Invested product areas getting significant support which is a big change from its history* - Interesting transformations into AI/ML and other technology trends","- Enforced ""Return to office"" agreements, that are also reviewed with your EOY performance/Objectives - *Highly dependent on product area as to business investment and support. There are 3 flagship products across Sage from my view, if you're not part of these products or integrating into these, there is little or no investment interest - Large focus on Newcastle HQ and London still, leaving other offices in dark corners (but its getting better..) - Not really sure how Sage will be the ""market leader"" of the technology trends but they have ambition for it - Still seeing silo'd product development of technology platforms eg. AI/ML with no Sage product buy-ins or roadmap integrations? - Management tends to keep close to reliable Sage people who fit the model and won't disrupt past a point"

Sage,5.0,"Feb 6, 2024",Apprentice at Sage Manchester,Account Manager,Current Employee,,"I’ve loved working at Sage since I first started. I’ve felt so welcomed and supported. From the onboarding mentor ,Sarah, to my manager ,Jeff, I have felt guided and helped.  

Being from a background which did not have anything to do without accountancy,  I was scared of being thrown in the deep end within the sales roll. My assumptions were proven false with the 121 help and onboarding process provided by the company.

Due to the unwavering support I’ve become confident on all the products provided here at Sage and also gained a significant amount of knowledge on Accountancy practises. I truly feel as though my career in sales would not have been able to flourish without this wonderful opportunity. 

I’d encourage everyone to consider working at Sage. The positivity of the company and the support of everyone within it goes unmatched.",I dont have anything negative to say.
Sage,2.0,"Feb 21, 2024",A once-great place to work ruined by leadership and old-school thinking,Line Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Newcastle upon Tyne, England","- Hybrid work (used to be more flexible with compressed hours, remote work etc but they've done a 180 on this - disappointing given so many were hired on a remote basis)
- Great colleagues
- Interesting work at times
- Commitment to volunteering/ESG nice to see","- Expected to commute to office twice-three times a week even if it means 2+ hours commuting each way - tired of hearing about how this is in the name of 'collaboration and culture' when the office is too full to be with your own team, parking is a total nightmare when you do go in, and we all know the real reason is the lease on the buildings Sage has stubbornly committed to. Everyone collaborated just fine during lockdown and ignoring the statistics around the benefits of remote work (Steve Hare has done so multiple times) is tone-deaf and comes across as an old-school mentality digging its heels in. 
- Round after round of redundancies - how can we feel happy at work when we might be next on the chopping block? Inexplicable rounds of redundancies even when company is enjoying significant profit. Colleagues with 10 years of dedication and working out of hours kicked out without a second thought. Feels greedy.
- Losing loads of amazing talent due to various things, including: inflexibility around remote work, tone-deaf C-suite, a lack of clear vision (company seems to be trying to be everything to everyone with too many activations across too many regions and products at once).
- Lack of empathetic leadership and next to no training opportunities available to employees including new managers - Sage Learning does not cut the mustard I'm afraid.
- HR are not there to help; they're there to parrot what C-suite say/want. 
- Mental health not a priority, any pleas for support or empathy on this front go ignored or denied with a coldness that is shocking in this day and age. This goes for senior management and HR."

Sage,2.0,"Oct 4, 2023",Be wary about joining Sage.,Software Development Team Lead,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"Upper Management are mostly clueless and have no real direction. The rest of us just have to pick up the pieces. Colleagues are really good to work with, and the work/technology can be interesting. If you can showcase your skill then advancement can be really easy, but it all depends on the quality of your manager.","Remote work was sold to us as necessary for the business with no proper justification. We're an international company, a lot of the people we communicate with are remote as we aren't at the same office. We sit there like a call centre, headsets and webcams on, not doing any real work because of the distractions in the office. Sage don't care about the travel/childcare costs incurred to us, it's not their problem. There's only two justifications I can see for moving to hybrid work, when the directors visit the office (rarely) they like it to be full so that they can film it every so often, and that they've had pressure from the canteen to get more customers. Upper management also act like cowards, changing things like hybrid working through internal twitter-like posts, instead of discussing it with us properly. This kind of behaviour has given many workers a negative outlook of Sage. Sage don't care about you, they like to shout about being human-focused but they're really not."

Everyone is generally very lovely, talented, and eager to help each other out.","Experience can be dependent on manager. Over dependence on at times cryptic procedure versus solving issues in a timely manner, though this is improving. The only real con is a recent slide back on flexible work policy. There has been a mandated return to the office two days a week. This makes sense for some functions, but not others. My team for example is spread across multiple continents, as are the teams we work with on a daily basis. I am commuting to the office to join the same Teams calls I did at home. The reason given was that teams that came into the office were more productive than others, citing studies conducted. No details of these studies were provided. It was also referred to as a “Team Agreement” but there was no consultation with any team I am aware of and everyone I know was surprised by this. Explanation was very patronising and no consideration given to personal circumstances. Morale amongst team mates is at an all time low and it would not surprise me if some leave in the near future specifically because of the mandated return to office. Very little in the way of facilities in the office, or events, to make up for this."

•Leaders are passionate about doing the right thing for their colleagues and their areas of business
•Have seen every issue raised to HR taken very seriously, with outcomes consistently made that align to company's values","•Sage has little to no change management skills. Every week there is an uncommunicated change that has been rolled out by teams that rarely understand the issues, the requirements, and avoid working with stakeholders to navigate
•Divide between UK based HQ and the rest of the world is huge. Central group team seem to tell rather than communicate, they rarely seek to improve foundational issues that are simple to fix - including issues that create legal risk
•Friendly culture and leaders who are passionate about their own areas create a challenge with effective communication. Company struggles to ask for or action on feedback that isn't spun in an overly positive manner, including when leadership operates with their own intentions in mind that may conflict with Sage's values
•Many leaders lack maturity resulting in silos and micro cultures. These can include keeping undesirable behaviors hidden from HR until they become a larger issue
•Some leaders have brilliant minds but do not always display our values, the company does not invest in leadership development that tackles these issues, prefer instead to focus on high level hot topics"

They are on the wrong side of the law and HR are aware of the behaviour and encourage it. There is no emotional intelligence and there is open discrimination on a daily basis. If you want to keep your mental health, do not work here. This is an employer which will lie and do not abide by the law. They will hack your personal devices and monitor your private phone calls. They will also leak your data to other employees, they have even leaked customer's information without any remorse. Open homophobia, racism and sexism is displayed daily. There needs to be new leadership and HR brought into the organisation or I do not believe this company will stand the test of time. The continuous grievances and unethical practices will bring this company down. You are losing good talent and years of experience due to HR not doing their roles properly and covering up illegal and unethical behaviour. NOT A NICE PLACE TO WORK. DO NOT APPLY HERE! The worst company to work for and they will leave you scarred for life. Be less worried about share prices and more worried about treating your staff right and being better human beings. STOP forcing your staff to write fake positive reviews to make yourself look better. Change your behaviour and DO THE RIGHT THING."

Flexible working requests have been cancelled, so now it's unfair with some colleagues on compressed/part-time hours to suit their home life, and others being rejected compressed hours with less consideration of individual needs. Hybrid working has meant colleagues are mandated to come into the office on a set day/s each week, again with no consideration of how individuals and teams were working pre-pandemic and impact that travel has on home life, costs and environment. Sage are very proud of their environmental impact, but don't factor in all the emissions they are producing by forcing colleagues to come in as they don't count these as company emissions. Been very tight on spend for over a year now, meaning we don't have budget for in person kick offs/ team building events, has a knock on impact on morale. New leadership in this department specifically has brought a very different vibe that seems much less people focused."

Sage,2.0,"Jan 22, 2024",A good company to work for if you have no ambition in sales!,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Winnersh, England","- You will have a good work/life balance and will not be required to work overtime. The environment is 'okay' and is not extremely stressful and high pressure like how some sales roles are.
- Most people within the company are friendly and are easy to talk to and work with.
- Sage are a well recognised company.","- Both the base salary and the commission is well below industry average. You will earn at least 20-25% working a similar role at a competitor of Sage.
- Career progression and promotions are non existent. The only promotion that is possible as an SDR is to become an Account Executive however the chance of this happening is next to none! When there is a vacancy as an Account Executive they do not even make the SDR's aware and the job is posted online and they will look to hire externally.
- Some of the senior managers at Sage Intacct are extremely rude. The Head of Sales / Account Executive Manager for Sage Intacct does not know any names of any SDR's across the business and will actively try and avoid us around the office. There has been times where he has ignored a 'good morning' and has actively avoided any form of interaction. This is extremely demotivating when this is the person we all try to impress and build a relationship with.
- The SDR's are treated as the bottom of the barrel within the business and are not cared about.
- The company culture and morale of the team had drastically decreased over the years. 
- There is never any events or any form of team building activities.
- Targets and KPI's constantly increase and become less attainable. It feels the senior management do not want us to earn commission.
- I could not fault my direct line manager at Sage as they always had a good relationship with the team and were willing to listen to our concerns. However, I feel that they do not have any power or any influence in the senior leadership teams decisions. 
- The staff turnover in the business is appalling. Very few SDR's would stay at the business for over 18 months and this doesn't seem to be any concern for the Senior Managers."

But, getting them from the drawing board to actual fruition was a slow and tedious business. When I was promoted to a Manager, there was no training at all and I didn't know the systems. My fellow Managers were wonderfully helpful, but it still would have been great to have some sort of training.
