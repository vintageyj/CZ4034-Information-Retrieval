So far, they are great. Product and engineering leadership especially.",The company is not public anymore and we are owned by private equity. We are in a declining market so it’s difficult to see how we get back on a growth trajectory. Benefits are weak compared to most other companies.

Avaya,4.0,"Nov 14, 2023","Challenging work, great people, questionable senior leaders",Service Delivery Manager,Former Employee,,"The work was challenging, which I enjoyed. Most of the people who work there are wonderful and it was a joy to work with them. While the customers had high expectations, they were also fantastic partners and many were loyal to Avaya.",Two bankruptcies in the 23 year history of the company indicates that senior leaders don't know how to properly use the Avaya brand and resources. No pay raises or bonuses for most of the employees for several years in a row. Recent massive layoffs to course correct after the latest bankruptcy significantly decreased morale.

Good place for an entry level to get real world work experience on the resume.,"Extremely disappointed with CEO Alan Masarek - started out strong with what turned out to be empty promises; ""we will be doing less with less"". Massive cuts at the worker level but no product rationalization so we are left to do the same work with far fewer employees. Alan is no different than any other corporate leader; he is bringing in more and more execs at the expense of the real workers and taking on pet projects. Laying off US workers with experience and corporate knowledge and attempting to hire in low cost regions. The real worker bees of the company are overworked and exhausted. ""Destination place to work"".... that is laughable. To be a DPTW first restore work-life balance, then add the fluff like pizza party or ice cream social."

Avaya,2.0,"Jan 10, 2024",Commissions are optional,Account Manager,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","New York, NY",Great deck of accounts where Avaya is very sticky.,"Getting paid commissions is a challenge. You have to fight to get paid on large deals and many times, will receive greatly reduced commission or no commission at all. Too many hands in the sales reps pockets. If Avaya spent as much time supporting their clients as they do managing the commission's budget, they would be unstoppable. Sales reps have little to no recourse once this happens."
Avaya,1.0,"Oct 9, 2023",Bad and getting worse,Senior Technical Consultant,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","Dallas, TX",The only real bright spot at Avaya are your co-workers. Always has been this way. For whatever reason they seem to get really great and capable people. No so with management. Some of the first line managers are good. Others are complete automatons. It's a mixed bag. Best case is an engineer who is now a manager. They're generally okay.,"Current CEO is a scumbag. We've had plenty of bad CEOs before this but Alan is the worst of them all. Countless broken promises. New edict: if you're within 40 miles of an office, he is now requiring commuting 5 days a week, no exceptions. Regardless of whether you've been virtual office or not for decades previously. Salaries are stagnant. They rarely do matching 401k contributions (they decide whether to or not for each period - ""sorry, better luck next year""), and the pay rises have been below industry standard for years, with no sign of changes. The product portfolio (usually a strength) has never been weaker. They were late to cloud and the offers are immature beyond belief."

Working at Avaya is like having an abusive boyfriend - you know you should leave, they keep promising to change, and then they beat you up again. Senior leadership is extremely unpredictable, changes strategy at the drop of a hat, and then blames employees and lays a bunch of people off when their decisions have led them into bankruptcy...twice."

I am happy to see that Avaya is finally addressing the lack of a cloud contact center and I hope they are successful.","Conflicting messages on DPTW. The CEO made a lot of noise on turning Avaya into a Destination Place To Work, but at the same time was taking steps to slash the workforce. I found that to be disingenuous as most employees were constantly looking over their shoulders, afraid of the next round layoffs. That has left most employees with a trust issue with the CEO.

Very old workforce with no younger people or cross-training or innovation. CEOs and upper management have no clue how to keep up with competitors or manage company finances/debt. They've gone into bankruptcy twice while upper execs walk away with golden parachutes. Multiple promotions with the promise of a raise, but no actual raise after 3 years of verbal promises. Bosses and leadership are very out of touch with reality. They expect employees to pull off insane projects with zero resources and absolutely no regard for the work that actually has to be done, so expecting perfect execution inside of a month for a 6-month project that requires 2-3x the planned budget. Was laid off the day after labor day with 1 month's pay as payment for 8 years of service. They don't care at all about employees or their development or happiness."

You are measured based on the performance of your team. I was highly regarded in this role, but my passion was aroused most when I worked within project teams and planned for the future.

Not micromanaged","Company and revolving leadership are all obsessed with cost-cutting 
Transition to Cloud and Subscription models are not successful
Old-school (1980s) mentality about work 
Company culture is toxic and most employees are ready to retire
Not agile in the least 
No innovation - always playing catch up to competitors

Other employee personalities are a major obstacle - pessimism about change abounds"
