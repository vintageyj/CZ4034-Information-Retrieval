Young people are manipulated into drinking.

2. People frequently join and leave in the upper management. If they think you don't belong to Informatica then it won't matter if you are good at what you do. They're kind of kim jong type of people.

3. Senior people are interested in knowing you if you are SINGLE. Why?...maybe more work will be put on your shoulders. Or for something else?

Informatica,1.0,"Dec 13, 2023",Horrible ,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"Pay was good, but the stock was not performing well.","I recently had the unfortunate experience of being laid off from Informatica, and I must say it was nothing short of a nightmare. The entire ordeal left me with a bitter taste in my mouth, highlighting the company's abysmal handling of employee matters, an out-of-touch CEO, and an overall toxic corporate culture.

Let's start with the layoff process. The way it was executed demonstrated a complete lack of empathy and professionalism. Employees were treated like mere numbers on a spreadsheet rather than individuals with families, livelihoods, and aspirations. The callousness displayed during this time was shocking, leaving many talented and dedicated professionals blindsided and without a clear understanding of why their contributions were deemed expendable."
Informatica,2.0,"Dec 3, 2023",A Case Study in Mismanagement,Principal Consultant,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","New York, NY",Competitive salary and benefits. Wonderful co-workers below the Director levels. Opportunity to work with every type of technology out there.,"The company failed to meet its potential since going private and then public again. The current CEO has not had much success. Great person but he’s changed. The CFO brought in had a reputation for cutting to raise the stock price and is doing the same here. Both the CFO and CEO have their million shares, so they see the cuts in a positive light as the stock rises. They’re just disconnected. Can’t blame ‘em. Blinded by money. As others have said, the cuts weren’t based on performance. That makes it worse for employees, with no one secure in their job. The technical debt is too high with the legacy software and the plans for on-prem to cloud for many products simply aren’t there."
Informatica,1.0,"Feb 27, 2024",Legacy Products and No Innovation,Product Manager,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Austin, TX",No pros that i can think of,"Many project managers lack foresight and struggle to envision beyond the outdated PowerCenter technology they're familiar with. The cloud product merely mimics PowerCenter and fails to accommodate new use cases, displaying a lack of innovation. While a few new products have been developed, they seem more geared towards presentations and briefings rather than actual market viability. The hype surrounding generative AI innovations appears empty and without substance."

Informatica,1.0,"Nov 4, 2023","Mass Layoffs- without prior notice , painful and unsettling experience",Solutions Architect,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","San Francisco, CA",Company Wide Mass layoff to achieve goal Lack of empathy for employee's Lack of Transparency Lack of Trust Lack of Support Below industry average payment,"In 2023, Informatica underwent two rounds of layoffs, a decision seemingly driven by the aim to boost the company's stock price. The experience of these layoffs was deeply distressing, particularly for those impacted in the R&D development team. Layoffs, when conducted fairly and transparently, can be understandable in certain scenarios—such as performance-based reasons or during mergers and acquisitions—provided employees are given ample notice. However, the manner in which these layoffs were executed warrants further discussion, as it left employees in both the United States and India in a state of shock and anxiety. The layoffs occurred twice in 2023, first at the beginning of the year and again in November. The suddenness of these actions, devoid of any prior information or clues, took employees by surprise, with emails sent just minutes after company-wide announcements, determining their employment fate. This abruptness caused widespread panic among the workforce, leaving individuals scrambling to understand their next steps. Employees who received layoff emails found their computer access revoked and their workstations wiped clean. Managers were directed not to take calls from affected employees. In the aftermath, the company's offices remained closed for 15 days, further unsettling the workforce. The repercussions of these abrupt layoffs were far-reaching, affecting individuals with varying tenures, from newcomers to those with decades of service ex: 24 years of experience within the company. Navigating the job market during the holiday season added an additional layer of hardship to those already reeling from the sudden upheaval. Furthermore, within the organization, reports of favoritism and group dynamics have cast a shadow over trust and fairness, particularly within the R&D team and leadership. Allegations of bias based on race or region have added to the distressing narrative. Witnessing colleagues lose their jobs in an instant, seeing their struggles during the holiday season to secure new employment, has been a painful and unsettling experience. Many affected individuals are immigrants, facing timelines and legal constraints in their job search. These developments have shaken the foundation of trust within the organization, eroding confidence in the leadership's vision, which appears to prioritize swift full-time employee terminations without adequate notice. It gives rise to second thoughts about recommending Informatica as a workplace. In closing, the lack of advance notification for these layoffs has compounded the distress. Employees who dedicated their time and effort to the company deserved a more considerate and empathetic approach during these challenging times. As a result, I hesitate to endorse working at Informatica, especially within the R&D team."

Informatica,1.0,"Apr 14, 2023",Marketing is a Mess,Marketing,Former Employee,,"Good pay, bonuses and benefits.","-Work itself: You will be overloaded and burnt out quickly. No one can keep up and have a life at the same time. Not to mention, you will be expected to do junior-level work. This will actually take up most of your time and will leave little time for the fulfilling parts. And, when you do actually get to the fulfilling parts, it will be so rushed that chances of success will diminish. -Management: Management is under such pressure that you should be prepared to be micro-managed at every turn. But, also they aren't there to help and support you when you actually need it. -Training: Neither I nor my colleague received any training. We face constant pressure from management to excel in all aspects without any formal guidance. They don't tell you how to do anything operational and expect you to just figure it out and if your mess up because you're just trying to figure it out managers/leadership will be mad. -Communication: Communication is poor and your priorities are constantly changing but, too often I'm not told that direction has changed and then reprimanded if I'm not ""on top of it.""

Informatica,4.0,"Aug 7, 2022","Great Technology and Work Culture, Lower Pay and Less Value for Coding Skills",Consultant,Current Employee,,"I think being at a Cloud Forward company is great as I get to learn cutting edge tools that are cloud native. Work environment is also good, I find my coworkers to be very supportive and there is value put towards learning. 

It has also been exciting being part of a company that just went public.",There haven't been enough cloud native projects to use skills and customers seem to be stuck on premises. I have been finding more and more coworkers leaving because they are getting better pay elsewhere. I have also unfortunately found that we are trying to do data engineering without using any code which isn't a great long term solution for the developers who lose their coding skills.

Informatica,4.0,"Jun 9, 2022","Good culture, broad product vision, but engineering alow to execute.",Solutions Consultant,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","New York, NY","Good people & mature internal processes. Long term product plans are solid - re-engineer existing Governance, Data & App Integration, and MDM products into a single, integrated, fully cloud ready platform.","It feels like they’re 2 (more?) years behind where they should be in their transition to the cloud. Some of this can be attributed their history of acquisitions, requiring engineering effort to integrate. But a reliance on legacy successes may have made them complacent. Not uncommon for companies with three decades of heritage - the innovator’s dilemma."
Informatica,5.0,"Sep 30, 2022",A company that values its employees and the work is good too,Consultant,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",,"Benefits
* Good pay (it was miles ahead of other ranges when I was job searching). This may be a con for you but there is an incentive bonus for hitting a certain percentage of billable time. I personally like that if I put the work in I get more money.
* Can work fully remote
* As of the end of 2022 still not much travel required, but that may change
* Stock options
* Flexible Time Off - the benefit of this is you never have to worry about running out of sick days and you get to access vacation time immediately

Culture
* The culture is fairly progressive
* I like my manager
* Generally everyone I meet is pleasant to work with and competent

Growth opportunities
* You can specialize in what you want. There are many products offered that have a different skillsets and challenges to go with them. You can mix and match. Learning new products is encouraged.
* IPS (consultants) Management that I've interacted with has a view of maximizing growth and helping employees build their brand. 
* Networking and grabbing (virtual) coffee is encouraged.

The work
* The fact that you can focus on what product you want and get to work with many different clients keeps the work fresh and exciting.","* Flexible Time Off - there are restrictions around it. Only a certain percentage of the team can be approved for vacation at the same time, which makes the holidays a little tricky. To offset this sometimes the company grants time off to everyone between Xmas and New Years. Also there is a soft cap at 3 weeks. Any time off beyond that needs additional approval.
*Healthcare is just pretty standard, but it has options. Though I came from a company with a very generous healthcare benefit so I may be biased.

Culture
*There is a lot of talking in corporate buzzwords at the C-suite level. It's just not my thing.
*Sometimes different teams seem siloed in their individual focuses, which may don't always work seamlessly together.

The work
* There is a focus on hitting your allocated hours which can sometimes get in the way of just doing your job."

Informatica,1.0,"Feb 25, 2022",Micro managers R US (and we've got spreadsheets to prove it!),Developer,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"It's a funny company, Informatica. They like to make money. Lots of money. Which is good for the board members, managers, and favorites. You like that? Go for it.
They talk about diversity. They are super-woke these days. If you like that, it's a great place for you!
Good place for beginners to get started. (Then get out.)","The biggest con? They do not keep money promises to employees. Not salary, not bonus, not stock, not perks. None of it. (Unless maybe if you are one of the favorites. And you will KNOW who the favorites are. It is obvious.) They'll make you think they will pay up. But they won't. And you will be shocked at how they get away with it. Cost of living?? Please.
In the last few years, they made plenty of money. LOTS of money. Yet did not pay full bonuses (always an excuse!) and pathetic (or no!) raises. There are PLENTY of companies out there who pay bonuses as promised and give decent raises. Informatica is NOT one you can trust in this dept. Oh but they will make you believe they really are not like that ... trust them. Good luck with that.
When they reopen the office, you'll see how ""diverse"" they really are. It is a company of EASILY 85%+ Indian people. Which is fine with me. I like Indian people and the culture. What I do NOT like is the pretense that this is diverse. It is not. Never has been. 
What else is funny? They are closet conservatives. Love that."

Unlimited vacation time but people take it unlike other places that switched to this policy and you look bad taking vacations.,Big portfolio of products so there is a lot to learn when you start here.
Informatica,1.0,"Apr 29, 2023",Toxic,Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Dallas, TX",Good overall benefits and pay. SKO is strong and Marketing tries to be helpful as much as possible.,My team (and manager) was quite toxic with a lot of favorites. Territories were practically all sucked dry so there was a little-to-no opportunity. You just need to be a little lucky to have a good manager and a decent territory.
