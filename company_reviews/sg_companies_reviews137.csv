SS&C,5.0,"Feb 14, 2024",Good,Business Analyst,Current Employee,"New York, NY",Overall is good. Kind of laid back,The work is a little bit boring
SS&C,1.0,"Feb 29, 2024",Not a good place to work,Senior Associate,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","New York, NY",Work from home remote and my co- workers,"No proper training, they just expect you to prepare financials by looking at prior year. They expect you to work long hours during busy season, they keep getting new clients but year end raise and bonus is very little compated to all the long hours you work. You do not get proper raise but they keep hiring new managers who are no help because they come from different industy but get paid much more. You are still on your own trying to figure things out."
SS&C,4.0,"Feb 16, 2024",Company Culture is top notch!,Data Migration Specialist,Current Employee,,"The company culture is amazing.  My business unit, Intralinks, treats their employees as valued members of the organization not to be taken for granted.  We are treated as adults and not children and as a remote worker, it's nice to know that I am trusted to get my work done even though no one is looking over my shoulder.  If something needs to change, management wants to know about it and they even give us ways to approach them without feeling threatened.  It's quite refreshing.","Cost of living increase isn't matching the rate of inflation which is making things a little challenging, but it's no reason to walk out."
SS&C,1.0,"Feb 27, 2024",Simply Aweful,Manager,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","New York, NY",They pay you on time 2x a month.,The pay is low compared to other companies. I have received very small bonus and there isnt open discussion on when bonuses are and even what the targets are. I've seen young staff get stacked up with a lot of work and sadly there is never any discussion from their directors on how to advance their careers. Never any discussion around what it takes to get promoted. Our team doesn't even get to celebrate in its own successes. Directors have poor attitude and as a result we get passed on by prospects for other service providers. Do not take a job here.

SS&C,4.0,"Nov 15, 2023",Lots of opportunities,Sales Director,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","New York, NY","Lots of opportunities for growth Very commercial organisation Friendly people Stock compensation if performance is high. Its a good company to work for, but it seems management is struggling a bit with the value/growth part of the company. We try to get growth pricing on WS, but then internally we are probably more a value set company. Always something going on in the company, On the front foot.","While cost efficiency is important, it looks a bit unprofessional with sub-par offices etc for client meetings."
SS&C,4.0,"Nov 1, 2023",Solid and Reliable,Senior Associate,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Los Angeles, CA","SS&C is a huge company and has a lot of stability. As long as you perform as you are supposed to, you will have job security. If you want to grow within the company, you will have to push hard to do so, but the opportunities are there. Great work from home policy. Solid benefits. Probably below average pay and the bonuses have been AWFUL since I started. I was promised 10-20% and I've barely gotten 5% for two years now. The work itself is interesting and I'm lucky to have an amazing manager and director who don't overwork us and make us feel valued. There's a nonjudgmental culture in my team which I really like as well. If I wanted to pursue a career in fund administration forever, I wouldn't even think of leaving.","For a technology company, they have awful technology. Their financial software is great, but their servers to host all the remote employees crash pretty regularly. I lose my bookmarks and access to email from time to time. It's frustrating to have to deal with finding everything again from scratch every couple of months."

FTO is good","Where to start? Bonus schedule seems to change annually. If promoted, has to be on annual merit cycle but no one can tell you what is your merit and what is your promotion amount (lumped together), they seem to let new associates just figure stuff out, so many new managers who are clueless to company policies but are too busy to have time to be trained, we used to be known for our customer service but it’s all about the bottom line now, CEO is ridiculously uncouth, work is going to India or to a bot, always a chance you’re next to be laid off bc your knowledge isn’t important but your age and salary will make you a target. Just don’t come here."

They don't seem to promote from within very much.

SS&C,2.0,"Jul 31, 2023",Management changed and understaffed.,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,"Jacksonville, FL",It's hybrid work environment and able to wear casual clothes in an office setting.,"When I first started, it was great. Management and team leads were subject matter experts and professional. Workload was steady which gave chances to learn new things. However, it didnt stay that way as management began to change and more was added to everyone's workload without additional employees. Things might have changed since I left. However, when the last year I was there it was not a healthy work environment. All of those who were subject matter experts of the department either left or changed departments. New management (specifically team leads) were not adequate. They didn't know much, thus created office hours so co-workers can help each other since they couldn't help. If they did help, it took a while for them to figure it out. Due to the pandemic and changes in processes/polices, the workload became heavier with small raises and bonuses. Instead of hiring the right number of people, they added more to your workload and if you didn't keep up with the new workload, you were now underperforming. In addition, they actually got someone fired over some bs. I was shocked that they and HR got away with how they treated her. Hopefully, the team leads received adequate training on leadership and respect and its a better working environment."
