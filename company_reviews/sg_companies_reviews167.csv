Wolters Kluwer,1.0,"Feb 14, 2024",DO NOT WORK HERE,Customer Service/Technical Support,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Wichita, KS",Nice coworkers but that is it.,"My mental health went down the drain working for this position because you are working 2 positions at the same time. Management had the bright idea of combining support I and support II positions into one single position. This means you take the interactions, document the cases, and close every single case. Cases that should go to more experienced team members are now your responsibility. You WILL have to be in contact with analysts and customers until the issue is resolved. Most managers have NO IDEA how to help you because they were hired from lateral positions in different companies, they just hold the title and go to meetings all day. This means, you WILL be trapped under a pile of unresolved cases because you are expected to close 15+ cases per day but an interaction can range from 5 minutes to 1+ hour. It’s like management wants you to fail. On top of this, during “tax season” you will have MANDATORY overtime. Your kids, spouse, family emergency… will have to wait because there is MANDATORY overtime. Your manager will have a word with you if you fail to comply to their terms. They 100% expect you to keep taking calls no matter what. They will lie and say they don’t micromanage and only “keep track to make sure you are getting the right help” but here is a list of the things they will track and record: Your calls, your chats, your status, your computer screen, your keyboard, your mouse clicks, your open cases, your closed cases, amount of time spent talking to customers, amount of time spent not talking to customers, amount time going to a personal break, and amount of time working on open cases. No micromanaging here though according to management.

You will be working over 40 hours nearly every week (including weekends). Every 2 weeks you will meet with your manager who will break down every thing and point out your deficiencies. 

Please do not work here and take care of your mental health. This job will squeeze the joy out of your life. Waking up to talk to rude customers is not a way to live.

Forget moving up here too. It will take years and if you’re not brown nosing, you have no chance."

ANd the worst part is that I have just as much experience in publishing as my ""Superior"" and significantly more experience in computers. The pay is sub-par and after the interview when I was offered the job I tried to negotiate a higher salary but was shut down immediately. The culture is very ""Lord of the flies"" in the respect thatthe only way to survive is to throw someone else under the bus. I chose not to do that to my co-workers and my boss was not happy.

It is a small company that is about to be smaller if they do not do something to make people less upset. You cannot take away freedoms and expect employees to work harder for you. You cannot yell at them like they are children and embarrass them in front of clients and expect them to be loyal and motivated.

Any billing issues will become your problem, and in my experience could take up to a year to resolve or even if it is the companies error. this takes so much time away from sales and is a constant stressor.
