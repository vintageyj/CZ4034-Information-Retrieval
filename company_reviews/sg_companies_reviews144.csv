World Wide Technology,1.0,"Feb 29, 2024",Getting worse by the day at NAIC1,Production Technician II,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,The people below leadership level are amazing.,"It's become just like any other warehouse job. Underpaid and overworked. They give you inadequate support and resources to do your job and you will have to improvise most of the time. This is highly technical work which you are expected to execute perfectly, but with little to no support. Managers will only promote their friends and family instead of people who are actually qualified. Leadership sits at their desks all day long and refuses to actually help. None of them could even help if they wanted because they all were hired from outside the company and don't know how to do anything job related. Favoritism is the foundation of leadership at NAIC1. They ship people they don't like to other buildings with at most 2 days' notice, so be prepared to adjust your childcare and educational schedule in the blink of an eye.

They police the floor and micromanage everyone out of the door. All of the tenured and talented employees have either quit or on the way out. The project manager is clueless and only comes around when it's time to complain about something. The last time I saw him, he walked around the floor upset that people weren't paying attention to him and we all got reprimanded for it.

We used to be treated like actual human beings. We are now treated like robots. Just parts of the dying machine. If you work here, just remember, you are replaceable and you mean nothing to this company."

World Wide Technology,1.0,"Feb 10, 2024",Very backwards company culture,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Maryland Heights, MO",Nice office space and good healthcare,"Pretty much everything else 
- pay was well below market rate. They say they benchmark against the market, but they give raises of 1-2% and when I left the company, I had been searching for a while and had gotten 5 different offers over the course of my year's job search and ALL of them were paying 25-35% higher than WWT. 
- very nepotistic, boys club mentality. High bonuses for execs of millions of dollars while refusing to give raises to the majority of employees that even keep up with the rate of inflation. 
- do not invest in resources. While I was working at WWT in the corporate Maryland heights office, the company won a large contract and didn't properly staff the warehouse to accommodate the shipments. Corporate execs then proceeded to shame the employees at the Maryland heights office to work their 8-5 desk job, then go work a shift at the warehouse in edwardsville from 6pm-11pm to pack boxes because they didn't hire enough workers. This was for no pay or benefit and they called it ""volunteering"" to fulfill a many-millions dollar contract that WWT was getting paid for. When people didn't sign up to ""volunteer,"" management accused people I worked with of not being team players. 
- the company spends money on very showy events like their Global Sales Meeting, where they fly out 1500 people from various sales/sales support positions to somewhere like Vegas to stay at a hotel like the Cosmo. Employees are forced to go, but then forced to SHARE ROOMS with coworkers. I knew people that had to share a hotel room with their bosses. No option was given to not attend the conference, and if you wanted to not share a room with a coworker/boss, WWT forced you to pay for your own accommodations. Very inappropriate and weird, especially since the bathrooms at the Cosmo have windows into the hotel room, so to shower, you had to coordinate a time with your roommate so they wouldn't be in the room while you showered and still would fear that they would walk into the hotel room and see you showering. The company spends money on things that don't matter while skimping on things like basic accommodations for a mandated work trip.

overall, this company does not have its priorities in line and needs to prioritize its employees rather than ONLY profit."

I have been to STL a few times and met many good workers in the warehouses. It's factory work for the most part, but they will be incredibly jealous of you for travel and pay after you start talking to them. It's a mixed bag. They heavily rely upon being black owned, yet in four years, I never saw the ""founder"" nor heard his name until BLM and Juneteenth came around. You would be surprised to know he existed at all, but they promote the heck out of it now. It doesn't really matter. WWT has a cult like following internally, until you begin to see the cracks in the foundation. Silicon Valley of STL, never quite worked out.

For a company that boasts revenue in the several billions, providing salary increases that are at least 6-10% (at the very least) is not asking for much. Unfortunately, no amount of culture initiatives or “perks” can outweigh the sheer stress and uncertainty your workers experience when they are struggling to make ends meet through no fault of their own.

Especially for the IT/Office side.,"Supply chain is lacking alot. Supervisors get their hands tied behind their back by managers. Executive management below the Jeree level doesn't make an effort on the floor, they barely walk around and really only know the best/worst workers by name/face. They don't really communicate with the other 95% of the work force. When they do walk the floor it's almost like they're subjecting themselves to something below them. Body language speaks alot about them. Not every NAIC/Program is equal. You can have awesome leadership in one area but terrible in another. Executive team should shadow their leaders more consistently to find where the supervisors/managers are lacking. The office/IT part of the company is treated differently than supply chain. I know this from GROW and communicating with them. Their leaders issues are nowhere near the leaders issues in supply chain and they always act shocked when we discuss that."

Normally it is just a flat 3% without wiggle room regardless of performance, though this seems to be improving somewhat. Only 1 year has been performance based so far, lets hope this is a trend. There are two companies at WWT. The warehouses/lab, and then the offices. They have -vastly- different cultures, with warehouse/lab being treated only as an expense not a value driver.

World Wide Technology,1.0,"Nov 26, 2023",The worse employer I have ever had the displeasure to work for!,Architect,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"When you don’t have to interface with management (managers, directors, VP’s, etc), great peers and colleagues.","Where do I start….I came to WWT because they had a minority owner in David Steward. I, for some reason, thought this would be a racially diverse company, from management to the engineering staff, with a plethora of opportunities to advance your career; however, I was completely wrong! There were things that were done to me over the course of 6-8 months of my tenure at WWT that were unbelievable. I was accused of aggressive behavior racially synonymous with a certain minority group. I was accused of unprofessional behavior by certain account teams and management despite their being no evidence to support these assertions. Management was unsupportive despite there being plenty of evidence to support my claims of what I was experiencing as racial microaggressions. Management loved the terms, “coach them up,” and “right seat on the bus,” which only applies to the majority. There’s so much I dealt with in my short tenure at WWT, and despite being technically “laid-off,” I declined the severance out of principle. I wanted nothing from a company that treats minorities in the way I, and others were treated. I was offered a couple options, #1 was totally disrespectful and not really an option, and #2 was resignation with severance, I chose neither. I’m extremely blessed to no longer be at WWT. The stress from this situation added 5 years to my life that I can’t get back. I’ll leave with this final note, I only experienced these issues within a certain group at WWT. I’m not sure how the rest of the company is/was, but under the conditions I described, I’m glad I didn’t stick around to find out. These are my opinions derived through my experiences with the company. The great thing is that I have all of this well documented. I started capturing it early on in the process as part of my own professional therapy session. I’m not sure what I’ll do with the information, but I will show it to my children as they need to know what to expect when they enter corporate America."

Moving up REGARDLESS of how great an Engineer or leader you are, is difficult. Meritocracy did not apply for some. WWT was not always like this; I was there long enough to see this ugly transformation. Sad because Jim and Dave are nice people BUT I cannot say the same for the managers.

World Wide Technology,2.0,"Dec 3, 2022",Beware of services-oriented employment,Professional Services Engineer,Current Employee,,The current health insurance plan is good.,"1) Frequent layoffs. WWT is hyper-focused on their ""Great places to work"" status, but only current employees are surveyed. Entire teams are often laid off without warning and without their ""great employer"" first attempting to relocate them elsewhere in the company or with regard to existing client contracts. This leads to a culture of uncertainty & fear, where workers are told to not to worry about the other cattle being loaded into trucks. 2) Services-oriented executive leadership is perpetually floundering. They simply don't know how to sell services, but when they do land a few deals they rapidly over-hire for those skillsets to meet anticipated future demand which never materializes, leading to a yo-yo-diet workforce. This feeds into layoffs as outlined in item #1. 3) They track every hour of your day with an internal tool requiring justification for everything. Viewed by some as micro-management is actually compensation for #2. 4) WWT thinks their ""values"" (the PATH) are unique in the industry, when in fact most large orgs have similar corporate mantras. What's unique is how hard WWT pushes these values in a cult-like manner, preached via weekly all-hands meetings and individual discussions with management centered around them. This is in addition to the billionaire chairman's ""prosperity theology"" ramblings, which may not be everyone's cup of tea."

World Wide Technology,2.0,"Aug 25, 2023","Siloed workaholic culture, constant change, lack of focus on execution, a risk to mental health",Solutions Architect,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,WWT gives the architects a lot of opportunities to get your hands involved. Lots of strategic discussions if you like that.,"Too many siloes. Everyone owns ""something"", until they have it ripped away by some other ""owner"". No one actually works together. You have no power to execute change with other people who might logically work with you. Management by checklist. Quarterly partner reviews are just a dog-and-pony show - there is no effort to fix things. Partner management is all about catering to a partner, not really integrating them. It's so easy to get trapped between competing demands on your role and no one will get with you to reconcile these changes. Manager X says, ""we don't do that, I'll fire you if I catch you doing that"". Manager Y says, ""it's your fault if this fails because you don't do that task."" Managers X and Y won't ever talk to each other - you have to figure out how to tread between the two poles. As long as the partner is helping fund your compensation and the check clears, they're fine with it. No one in leadership wants to hear about problems. The approach is to ""counsel"" you out of believing that. There's no culture of solving a problem or changing an established practice. There are too many layers of management for such a relatively small company - I influence millions of dollars of revenue and I'm 8? levels below the CEO (and it's always churning - no one ever knows who is actually in charge). I'm working 2 full-time jobs, it feels like, with little practical support to navigate between them. I'd like to look for a different role in the company, but I'd be blocked by my current boss and the vendor management. I don't even know who I'd escalate to. There's no HR group with an open door policy. I'm too well known outside WWT that when/if I started looking around, it'd be very public. There's no ""quiet"" job search in my role. My mental health has severely declined in this role. I'm tired of people saying (even jokingly) that I'm going to get fired when I try to take initiative to solve things that they don't care to solve."

There are teams that have not been managed properly (mainly due to customer demands and requirements) and could use experience from other program management. Like everywhere there are the teams of yes men and minimium effort workers that seem to get promoted which brings down moral. 
This is not the case for the company as a whole, but it is where you will find majority of the problem areas. Majority of the negative reviews come from those teams' employees."
