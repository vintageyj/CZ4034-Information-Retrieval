It's hard to get anything done, since a manager or department head is ready to call or jump in on messenger to lecture you about the ""proper"" ways of doing things here (even if you have followed the rules and you are trying to fix the problem and help those in the company who have generally been ignored)."

If you are a seasoned engineer, stay away, unless you just want a job with decent pay and if you don't have a personal life, it might work out for you too. Good old boys' system, they have a tendency of overworking Korean speaking employees, if you are not, you will be fine, just do your job and don't speak up, you will have a job. They validate my firm belief in competency breed incompetence, and this company is prime example of it. You will end up doing someone else's job and you won't even be recognized for it.

This is a global conglomerate so opportunities are definitely there whether you are in IT or Business. You have exposure to many projects and challenges and take full autonomy over those projects (read: long hours, high reward... if you're intrinsically motivated). The health benefits are great. Culture is all depending on which location you work out of. Training programs are easily accessible and widely encouraged.","This organization is not for the faint of heart. SDS is still struggling with the clash of ""Samsung-style"" Korean culture & American workforce culture. If you have zero empathy for other cultures and cannot adapt, you will not survive.

	No family-working balance.   Long hours 9-6, other companies are 9-5.  However, you can never leave at 6pm.  Your manager expects you to stay late every day.  Sometimes work till midnight, and no compensation day/hour.  
	Not flexible.  Too controlling manager style.  No chatting, no talking on the phone during office hour.   Office is so quite, you just need to work like a slave.  You cannot go lunch on your own schedule.  
	No trust between managers and employees.  My co-worker was asked to bring in a doctor’s note for one sick day.  Managers get nerves when people ask for sick days, because they don’t want people to go for interviews. 
	No chance of moving up in the corporate. Korean team drives the project; I did not get to design and contributing my ideas.

Everything here is based on fear, not enthusiasm.  Bosses will use fear against you by only complaining/putting you down/only talking about every thing bad, without saying one good word about you.

There is no team work. It is like the Americans and Koreans are fighting against one another. The Koreans don't want to hear the ideas of the Americans which makes no sense since it would help the business tremendously.

Too dependent on business from Samsung Electronics and that business continues to decline.
Management has the best intentions but is unable to build the right products with the right features the market needs."
Samsung SDS,1.0,"Feb 28, 2018",SDSRA - bad place for your career,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,"San Jose, CA","High quality problems to work on (but not enough quantity). Good work/life balance and good facilities (gym, nice office, nice cafe, etc). Good place to get 2 years of experience, but terrible place to stay longer than that",Low pay - 6% bonuses and 2% raises each year regardless of how well you do. Also no stock and no promotions except for a couple people who know which butts to kiss and how to kiss them. HR is completely out of touch with reality of keeping good people around in Silicon Valley. More than half the team left in the past year and more will leave soon because getting an offer somewhere else is guarantees to be higher pay
Samsung SDS,3.0,"Apr 26, 2015",business development,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,,"Worked with some of the smartest and brightest people in the IT services industry.  Also a huge focus on teamwork, and a dedication by everyone to do whatever it takes to get the work done.","Senior executives really don't have a deep understanding of the specific functional areas and lack the industry knowledge to drive business.  Samsung is an organization that develops and nurtures managers that are generalists and more focused on administration and management.  In order to succeed, it needs to invest more in bringing quality talent from within specific industry sectors, especially at the higher levels of the organization."
Samsung SDS,5.0,"Mar 28, 2018",good,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,,"best work environment and working condition. The building was equipped with full amenities like cafeteria, restaurant, shops, and gyms (in a separate building) and colleges were the best.","Busy times, you needed to work over night for weeks. Not very diversified in terms of employees. Uses its own word system which can by annoying sometimes."
Samsung SDS,1.0,"Aug 19, 2017",ROCK Star Employees WORST NIGHTMARE,Human Resources Representative,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Ridgefield Park, NJ",Prestigious Name / Brand and food.,Stiff Culture | Low morale | Employee high turn over - 80-90% of the time Contractual Positions. ZERO growth. System is Old School / Primitive for being in the I.T. Industry - Ridiculous
Samsung SDS,3.0,"Feb 13, 2019",Limited Opportunities Unless Native Korean,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"The physical amenities of the campus are very nice. Lovely space, good cafeteria (though trending downward), good gym, plenty of nooks to work privately. Opportunities to travel domestically and to Korea. 

Colleagues are friendly. Work-life balance (compared to the other offices in Seoul) is good, but be prepared to drop your life/cancel your vacation/work for 48 hours straight if an executive comes to town at the last minute.  

The Samsung name opens a lot of doors and looks very good on the resume.","There are exceptionally limited opportunities to move up or succeed unless you are a native born Korea. It's unclear who has it worse, Korean Americans or non-Koreans in terms of being taken seriously, getting put on good projects, or even just your colleagues in Korea being willing to work with you.  Pay for expensive areas to live like Silicon Valley and Seattle is very low. 

Annual reorganizations completely ruin any long-term planning for team. Extreme focus on P&L can make investment efforts that will pay off in a couple years but require initial work to gain traction are killed before they are given a chance. 

HQ is very opaque and it is hard for regional offices to understand strategy and direction for the year. Additionally, the Seoul Office has the final say in absolutely everything. If a product is developed in Samsung SDS America, HQ will take over the project/source code from the regional office. This leaves the individuals in the regional offices demotivated in their work. All initiatives must have a sponsor in the Korean office as well, even if it is a regional initiative.  But if you're not from the Korean office (ie you have prior personal connections) you can't even find who is the right person to talk to about sponsoring."
Samsung SDS,4.0,"Sep 12, 2015","Cutting edge technology, rapidly growing team",Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","San Jose, CA","Cutting edge technology, such as Spark distributed computing framework and Scala programming language. Co-workers are good at their fields. Potential access to interesting data.","HQ is in Korea, so you may get the occasional email with snippets in Korean that you don't understand (day-to-day work is completely in English). Like with any rapidly growing team, projects change, so you have to be flexible."
