-ethereal targets and expectations that don't line up between roles creating a mostly tribal merit system
-beyond the murk of their evaluation framework, the actual targets in metabase are seemingly idyllic: expected to resolve 4-5 tickets daily with an average MTTR of 3-5 days, meaning you are juggling around 20-25 tickets daily
-bloated frankenstein-like onboarding, KB structure falling apart with botched attempts at making it all more accessible using distractive surface-level solutions that do more harm than good
-consequently spirals into underprepared onboarding, leading to misaligned targets tracked meticulously through Metabase
-the company's decent attempt at creating a welcoming work culture ends up sabotaged by the aforementioned cons, creating an uneasy and tense atmosphere that is difficult to adjust to
-be prepared to be silently let go after the three months of onboarding, with team members asking why you quit; this is how the company has dodged the layoff sensationalization. managemement will evade discussing this with you and instead initially gaslight you into believing any mistakes made in training are expected while later leveraging it against you.

Datadog,2.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Glossy on the surface, not so great underneath",Senior Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","New York, NY","* Aggressive pay rates that aimed to compete with top-talent companies (Google and Facebook were routinely called out)
* Stable company that appears to be able to weather turbulent market conditions without massive layoffs","* Leadership was very divorced from day-to-day work of employees, which translated to a lot of needless frustration and crunch on behalf of bottom-level workers
* Company culture around DEI was shockingly poor (especially wrt. women's issues), and top-level leadership was flippant at best about these problems
* While they theoretically support remote work, in practice their benefits, IT, and HR teams are entirely focused on the main HQ locations, meaning remote employees are often left floundering on their own for even basic issues
* Crunch time was a constant expectation, especially for those lower in the hierarchy: on-call shifts of 3-weeks out of 4 was the norm, and most engineers are expected to contribute extra hours towards interviews (often multiple per week)"
Datadog,4.0,"Dec 29, 2023","Great company and product, management could be better",Commercial Account Executive,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Boston, MA","Datadog has arguably the best platform in the market, which ultimately makes selling a lot easier. It takes quite some time to fully understand the product and how to sell it, especially if you don't have experience in the observability/cloud space. However, if you are willing to in the work, you will learn A LOT of things that can be applied to in the tech industry. 

I think the onboarding training is also really good, and during that first week you will be drinking water from a fire hose for sure. While it seems overwhelming, everything will make sense later on. You will be learning something new in this role for sure. The co-workers are also great, with some becoming actual friends, benefits are also good. And some work events are very fun.","For sales specifically, for the US Territory, expectations can sometimes be very unrealistic. There also seems to be a short amount of time/toleration for reps in many teams. 

Not every team is like that, but I would say that there a few ""bad apple"" managers stain the reputation of the company."

Account distribution was anything but equal, and favoritism was a bit ridiculous.

I also felt like we were treated like children regarding work hours, where in the office we were ""allowed to make calls,"" working remotely, etc. The VP of Sales from Boston is incredibly controlling about things that really don't matter, and it trickles down and kills the culture.

They ask you to push their events but will also get upset that you didn’t hit your daily KPIs within your accounts. Leadership is just a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off running around.

Datadog,5.0,"Jun 8, 2023",My Time at Datadog,Mid Market Account Executive,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Denver, CO","I joined Datadog directly out of college 3-years ago as an entry-level BDR/SDR. My long-term goals were clear to me & Datadog has provided everything I was looking for as a young rep in tech sales. 

I am constantly surrounded by some of the brightest minds in the industry, and am able to receive hands-on training directly from the source. 

I've had the opportunity to work deals with exciting logos early in my career. 

The enablement is world-class. On both Product & the Technology Sector as a whole. 

I am compensated handsomely for the hard-work I put in. (Also DDOG Employee Stock hold a ton of value) 

The environment is fast-moving & competitive. Meaning, you perform well, and you can advance your professional roadmap quickly. (I'm on my 4th promo in 3 years)","The Cons of being an AE/Salesperson at Datadog depends on an individuals desires & goals within their new role. 

For example - If someone is looking for a role with the majority of their salary coming from base pay, New Business Sales at DD (and most tech companies) is not a perfect fit. 

If someone is looking for a role with a heavy amount of inbound pipeline, the Account Executive seat at DD is not a perfect fit. 

If someone isn't driven to reach promotion in a competitive environment, and would like a more steady 9-5 role, the Account Executive seat at DD is not a perfect fit. 

All in all - it's an environment & role fit for people driven to make significant strides in professional development, work complex deals, and receive compensation that reflects their input."

They are making employees go to the office, even though people contract COVID there on a regular basis. Senior leadership is extremely dismissive of health-related concerns; they only care about getting butts in seats to justify their lease in the New York Times building. The CEO recently referred to people who work from home as ""pseudo-humans"" during an all-hands meeting.

The product has an excellent market fit, but leadership is incapable of creating scalable processes. There is constant chaos as teams struggle to work together on half-baked ideas.

I suspect the following to be key factors: low pay raises, limited internal promotions, RTO, and a strict fixation on KPI's/metrics coupled a growing pressure from upper management for high performers to maintain unsustainable workloads to offset those departures (while making up for the low performance of others). There are likely even more factors and explanations for this that lower level engineers are shielded from ever hearing about, save for unfounded rumors - To the above, all this has been feedback I have openly shared with my managers, and frustrations that I also have. The response I get is often one of acknowledgement of these conditions, and a promise that there are initiatives and plans in place to make improvements in the long-term. However, change rarely comes. Teams consistently operate undermanned as there does not appear to be a good process in place for capping PTO requests and development days, target metrics and KPIs are not adapted to account for the volume and complexity of different product areas a support engineer is assigned to specialize in and support, discrepancies in the amount of assigned work between high and low performing individuals in a team, only continue to grow.

Datadog,5.0,"Oct 11, 2023",Growing company with a great culture,Sales Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,It is rare to find a fast growing company that has focused so heavily on maintaining their culture.

Management truly cares about employees and actively review employee surveys to build plans to improve any items that were noted as needing improvement.

From the top down there are deeply rooted toxic mentalities that pervade across 2nd and 1st line leaders, akin to things you'd see at a used car dealership. Most lack emotional intelligence as the only people who can be promoted are those who sold a ton, instead of those who have the ability to lead others or deep product/customer understanding (more on that in a bit). They develop their favorite reps and then collaborate with other leaders on how to ""manage reps out of the business"" that aren't meeting that same standard. - Account distribution is essentially a nuclear wasteland of accounts that have been burned through for 5 years and 8-10 reps non-stop (not hyperbole). The small minority of great accounts are given to reps who have demonstrated some success (often through lucky timing) and then it snowballs from there; the rich get richer. If you do close a deal, you have to wait until the second month bill is paid, which typically takes 3 months from closed won - good luck forecasting your bills. - Unachievable quotas (ARR matching some Mid-Market and Enterprise roles at other SaaS companies) and the distribution problems in my previous point lead to around 5-9% of reps hitting their attainment for the year - quite a marked difference from the 40-50% communicated in interviews. Lead-gen and SDR influence are like the icing on the cake, except your manager decided that only one of your teammates gets the cake, and that you also have split the icing with everyone else on the team. - The culture is *Grind* There are 3 days required in office each week, 8:00ish to 5:30ish on those days, with no exception. PTO is unlimited, but if you try to take too much or schedule a personal appointment on an in-office day, your manager almost assuredly will be talking poorly about you behind your back. If you like the feeling of constantly looking over your shoulder - even when you're working hard - then this job is for YOU! - Professional growth is non-existent. They would rather churn out a wake of young sales professionals to meet their margins than actively support and develop the people who could make a lasting impact. If you lack emotional intelligence and are content to be used as a club by leadership to beat customers into submission, you might have a long and storied career in this vertical. If not, your days are likely numbered. - Most importantly, they lie. They lie about attainment, leads, career progression, and commission. They weasel their way with a tight corporate legal and HR team and find ways to wring you dry, mind, body, and soul - all while you make almost no money beyond their below-market base pay. You are even lower in their eyes than just a number, you are cannon fodder to be blasted at potential ""customers"" who just want to be left alone after years of constant harassment."

Favoritism is an understatement here. It is the classic ""Best sellers make the best leaders"" (They don't) and if you do not fit the mold of your manager, you will be shunned like an ugly duckling. Leadership is the main problem here. With a massive ""selling bro"" as the director, anyone who was not in a frat, didn't play lacrosse or doesn't enjoy drinking with their coworkers till 4 AM on a Wednesday will be looked at as a ""loser"". Middle management tries to provide an open door policy, but slip up and say anything negative and you can expect to be forced to quit via an unachievable PIP or fired on the spot. When in the interviewing process, ask the managers how many people have been on and off their team over the past calendar year. Ask how many reps an account goes through before being closed out. Ask the director how they train/empower their leaders. Ask how many reps have quit the job without any other jobs lined up (The number is staggering)."

AEs and SDRs are so far from hitting quota quarter over quarter, with less than 5% reaching quota while I was there. I’ve heard that only 3 AEs in the Denver office (out of 75~ AEs) hit quota in Q3 of 2023. You’ll be assigned 80 accounts and are encouraged that you’ll find a way to break into the accounts but they’re incredibly dry accounts with no interest in even having a conversation, plus you are now the 5th or 6th AE to reach out to them. In order to get a decent account in your name, you have to be one of the “popular” AEs who hangs out with management outside of work. You’re forced to go into the office 3-4 days a week, having to pay for parking each day. When you’re in the office the environment is toxic, dull, filled with negative energy, management won’t even talk to you or your team when passing in the office - literally they act like you don't exist. Promotions are very far and few between - the top rep in Denver is at his yearly quota, and was told he would qualify in July, and now as we approach November still has not been promoted. Turnover is very high, and new hires are noticing this within their 2nd month. Prior to leaving, other AEs were talking about leaving and have left and since leaving several AEs have reached out to me asking if the grass really is greener outside of the Datadog office walls, to which I can confidently say it is. There are “quarterly sales reviews” where management travels into Denver, all AEs and Managers are scheduled to sit in the cafeteria together while people get picked and told the day of to present their previous quarter sales metrics in front of 100+ people. Giving people constant anxiety for the entire day that they’re going to get called on to present. They then get grilled in front of 100+ people. It has been described as “hazing” throughout the Denver office’s sales team. Not only is this day unproductive, but embarrassing for all parties involved - especially senior managers and directors whose narcissism and ego lead them to have to comment on each and every line of a reps QSR. Don’t get sucked into drinking the Datadog kool-aid. You’ll make a very minimum base salary to be a glorified SDR with an AE title, with making commission during your first quarter of ramp and then after that you’ll make minimal commission because quota is not attainable. You’ll either be in a popular clique where the day to day might be “okay” where you don’t mind coming into the office from a social aspect or you’ll be on the outside of the cliques and counting down the hours until you can leave the office at 5:30 PM (at the earliest). If you’re interested in a “company culture” that forces happy hours and gives you free snacks, give this place a shot. If you’re interested in a “company culture” where management cares about their employees, quota is attainable, you’re seeing yourself develop and grow professionally, you have the ability to control your book of business and make money, then Datadog is not for you. Stay away."

Datadog,2.0,"Aug 17, 2023",Avoid The Technical Support position,Solutions Engineer,Current Employee,,Datadog is a good company in terms of product.,"Management at certain organizations doesn't quite know what they're doing; the Datadog culture is dying because of senior leadership changes. In stead of promoting tenured people, they hire new people with significant higher salaries and cap the raise ( which is minimal). Salaries for the support role is lower than industry standards too and yet they are very cut-throat about performances and metrics. There's little internal mobility although they promise it. Once you get here it's stuck. With the technical support roles, they don't take measures to set customer experiences despite promising it for a very long time. I'm afraid Datadog has become the typical corporate trap in every single aspect."

I was not a “favorite” and continuously worked tirelessly to appease the Commerical Sales Managers to earn a promotion.

Datadog,1.0,"Oct 23, 2023",Do your research before starting a Commercial AE job here,Commercial Account Executive,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Denver, CO",- In depth training of Command of the message & MEDDICC (applicable for all future sales roles and essential to your success at Datadog) - The ability to stand behind a very strong product suite throughout sales cycles is a major plus - No layoffs due to a very smart CEO/C-Suite spending money in the right areas - Most people on the floor are great human beings,"- This is the most stressful job I've ever had. Although there are a few positive aspects to mention above, these pale in comparison to the negatives. If you're considering a role at a supposedly ""stable"" tech company, I strongly advise you to read the negative reviews closely to understand what you're getting yourself into. During the interview process, they might claim that 30-40% of reps hit quota, but this is far from the truth. In reality, only about 5-7% (and that's being generous) of sales reps consistently hit their quotas, and many of them rely on opportunities closed in the past to achieve this. - When you're grinding from 7 am to 6 pm and hitting quota, your managers and leadership will love you. However, if you're working those same hours but falling short, you'll notice a significant change in the way you're treated from top to bottom. The VP of Sales will give locker room pump up speeches about how, “you can do big things here and make a ton of money”. While that happens for a few individuals every quarter, 97% of reps struggle day in and day out. - When sales reps regularly make jokes about suicide in the office, that usually means there's a bigger problem within the org as a whole. (Don’t try to justify this and say this happens everywhere, it really doesn’t.) - If you have a doctor's appointment or car troubles one of the three days you’re supposed to be in the office, expect to hear about it from your manager. That’s just not okay apparently. - When a high performing AE leaves the company, people talk about it for a day or so and then it’s old news. The next ""hungry"" sales rep steps in, eager to prove themselves until they too eventually burn out. It's an ongoing cycle that repeats itself time and time again. - Unfortunately, it's unlikely that anything will change within Datadog's commercial sales org. From a revenue perspective, it works. They are willing to sacrifice their employees mental wellbeing in order to please investors long term."

During the post-pandemic period, a significant influx of managers, ranging from EM1 to VP levels, joined the company. It's become apparent that each of these managers is primarily driven by their career advancement ambitions. They chose to join Datadog and brought in numerous new hires, seemingly as a means to bolster their own standing within the company. Engineers, for the most part, tolerated this situation as it didn't directly impact their day-to-day work. However, with the recent decline in the market, the C-suite has started to scrutinize these empire-building endeavors, seeking concrete evidence of their achievements. Moreover, they've reduced the available headcount for these managers, which has prompted them to set unrealistic deadlines and closely scrutinize their own engineering teams. Consequently, we've witnessed a wave of engineer layoffs, and those who remain are under immense pressure to produce results, even though the managers seem uncertain about the specific goals they want to achieve. It appears that these managers are primarily concerned with protecting their own positions, even if it means sacrificing the well-being of our services, team morale, and the actual work being done. Regrettably, the atmosphere within the company, especially within the NYC office, has become quite hostile due to management's insistence on framing every engineer's existence as a zero-sum game. To pave the way for a more promising future, it's imperative that management undergoes a restructuring process that emphasizes technical expertise. We can only hope that this review reaches the ears of Datadog's HR department and is subsequently brought to the attention of Olivier and Alq, so they can take corrective action with regards to our current management team. Datadog should consider a reevaluation of its leadership, similar to the approach taken by Meta, in order to rid the company of empire builders who are now resorting to engineer layoffs."

Salary is great. They try VERY hard to be seen as a good company to work at.,"This is just my situation. But it is a doozy. I was contacted by one of their recruiters, looking to hire for the position since the person who had that position got promoted. Interview was fine, expect for one Sr level person who the recruiter warned me was an odd person. Little did I know how odd. I got the position, and took the job. The immediate team and manager were fantastic, but there was some cult-ish and strange sense that I could not shake. Almost 2 years into the position, it became very clear just how thin skinned the Sr level manager really was. If management even gets a hint of a worker who has a mind of their own, be prepared for surveillance. I was contacted by a Sr person in the HR (people ops! Naturally!) dept telling me to take my TikTok account down because it seemed like I was speaking negatively of the company. Meanwhile, the Sr person who had just become my manager recently was actively looking at ways to get rid of me. Eventually it came to a place where there was just no way to be at the company and maintain my sanity. But it is amazing the lengths at which HR will go to bat for bad leadership and make excuses. I heard from other employees during my tenure how bad things could be, and I am sad to learn that no one exaggerated just how bad things can be. The CEO and his co founder are pretty aloof for all their talk of how much they consider themselves part of the team. Which is fine, they’re both worth multiple billions. But they’re pretense that they are just like us - that’s not an honest picture. For all their talk of being a very modern company, sadly Datadog is just as “corporate” as 100+ year companies."
