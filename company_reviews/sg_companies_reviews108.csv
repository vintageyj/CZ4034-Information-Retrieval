Too many moonshot investments that never pay off while the management remains ever optimistic about the next big idea without any practical plans for how to actually make something work in practice even if it were a great idea/solution.

Favouritizm is at its extreme in a PPT driven leadership culture, all the while, the people who keep the company going are never listened to.

Little to no opportunity for advancement if you enter as an engineer and not a manager. Constant executive turnover. You won't know the names of anyone except the CEO. HR executive turnover constantly leads to new ""initiatives"" which manifest as delaying and rescheduling bonuses and raises. Teams are heavily siloed. You won't know who to talk to about another product. Engineer-to-engineer collaboration isn't encouraged between teams. Salaries are well below industry average.
