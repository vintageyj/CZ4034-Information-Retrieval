SMB ERP space is the only growing area in 2023 - onward.","-CEO is following orders since the Koch acquisition. Shed top talent and leaders during the 2022-2024 lay-offs. 
-No R&D and differentiation to the products.
It took 3 years to showcase RPA/ML inside their ERP strategy with their OS platform which is not utilized by the majority of customers. 
-New leadership is needed to spark any change and impact. IFS and Epicor are steadily going to surpass Infor by 2025-2026 for these reasons.
-Certain titles at Infor were a revolving chair and the re-orgs were occurring a few times a year.
-I heard from the top that we had years of declining pipeline growth. That's alarming."
