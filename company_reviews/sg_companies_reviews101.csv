NCR,4.0,"Feb 8, 2024",Good teams trying to save aging tech,SMB Account Manager,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,"NCR is a great place to get corporate experience. Working in SMB Hospitality, the teams really cared about restaurants and did their best. Managers were open to feedback and very supportive. Restaurant technology is a fun industry.","The biggest challenge for the NCR SMB Hospitality is aging technology. NCR Aloha was the clear market leader a decade ago but the resources were not invested to keep it current. This is resulting in much of the SMB market going to Toast.

Also, the support and billing were moved overseas. These people are nice but often aren't properly trained. This leads to very angry customers over long support holds and duplicate billing. They are trying to make NCR Silver (Aloha Cloud) the future but it needs much more investment to catch up with competitors (like Toast & Square).

All that being said, I enjoyed my time at NCR because of the people. There is still a place for NCR in larger chains. If you only have restaurant experience and want to get a corporate business job, this is a great place to start."
NCR,1.0,"Mar 7, 2024",Terrible,Customer Service Technician,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Manchester, NH","Training is pretty decent for entry level. If you have to work here, volunteer for as much training as you can, and then leave. 

That's about it.","The hours in my area were variable. Sometimes you started at 730am, and this would ruin until 530pm. Yes, the standard day is 10 hours, but you only get paid for 8. First and last 30 minutes of travel are unpaid, and there's a mandatory 1 hour (unpaid) lunch that you have to take. They're obviously hoping you just work through it, which happens to most techs I've met. Pretty scummy behavior, but it gets worse.

When I submitted my 2 weeks notice, I asked my boss if NCR paid out unused PTO he said that they did. He said that so I wouldn't ask for some of the time of my 2 weeks notice off, because I'm my state they do NOT do that.

On my last day, I submitted my last expense report on my company card. I thought everything was settled. They never contacted me at all after that. They never paid the last set of expenses despite my documentation, and just let my AMEX go to collections. Their turnover is also crazy. My brother had 4 managers in 2.5 years, because again, terrible place."
NCR,2.0,"Feb 5, 2024","Sales-Focused, not Execution Focused",Account Support Manager,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","Raleigh, NC",Many great coworkers and friends I’ve made over the years. First line management is also generally pretty good and grounded.,"This company is run by people who are career salesmen. And sales is all that they care about. This is reflected in almost all levels of the culture. Sales teams are often (and exclusively even) given the best perks and benefits, and are almost always the only ones being recognized by executive leadership on the all-hands calls. 

Meanwhile NCR invests laughably little (about 3%) into innovating the vast array of legacy products it constantly misrepresents as being cutting edge, and the actual newer products are also often years ahead of being working and viable solutions, but are sold anyways.

Execution and delivering on promises to customers is a distant second priority. That is until this rush to the sale’s finish line mantra complicates another sales opportunity, and leadership will then throw all hands on deck to (temporarily) fix said problem to keep the customer on the sales hook.

You will constantly hear executive leadership saying “the customers are first”. It’s all nonsense. What they really mean is “the sales pipeline is first”. And these aren’t just my words, at least three high level customer contacts (c-suite and director) have told me this same thing over the years."

They are some truly awesome people in Omaha that you trauma bond with.,"The leadership within Omaha leaves much to be desired. It’s very top down and many people have left the company because of one leader in particular, yet nothing will change because the leadership group goes way back prior to D3. They have very unrealistic expectations of Product Owners, and don’t clearly communicate those expectations until it’s a problem. I left because the work life balance was not good, the leadership said you should be a full SME within 3-6 months, but would change the span of ownership every over month. It was very hectic and if they felt you weren’t keeping up or asked too many questions, you were labeled as incompetent by one leader and she made sure you were aware of it. 
This leader also disregarded any type of Covid restriction the company put in place because she was vocally anti-vax."
NCR,5.0,"Feb 19, 2024",Good Experience,Systems Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Atlanta, GA",Lots of experience around. Many people have worked at the company for decades.

A specific person on the management team made sexually abusive remarks and was not fired or reprimanded at all. Management was covering up for this person and nothing ever happened. I felt as I was forced to quit I couldn't even listen to the sound of his voice when we called meetings. What kind of business are they running?

We all did our best despite the workload becoming more and more as people get let go and no backfill. 

There is quite the building of comradery as we suffer together.","This company sets you up for failure. It is sink or swim here, and it is most common for people to be drowning. Terrible communication, zero training, and no documentation.

I stupidly worked extremely long hours because it was urgent. Nothing is ever urgent when everything is urgent.

I had very inadequate managers, project managers, and coworkers. Most of my team was abroad. They were absolutely incompetent and liars. There were a few star developers sprinkled in. Many had no idea what they were doing and constantly pushed out bad code. They didn't like when I pointed out their problems. It meant they had eyes on them. I've experienced them lying about them doing work. They couldn't possibly do work if their lab wasn't up and connected.

I feel bad for the good ones who worked long hours and weekends."
NCR,4.0,"Oct 30, 2023",NCR,Executive Director,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Atlanta, GA","Working at NCR Corporation in the Professional Services department provides a unique blend of positive experiences and challenges. The company offers a dynamic work environment, encouraging personal and professional growth, and fostering a culture of collaboration. Employees often find themselves surrounded by talented colleagues, enabling knowledge sharing and skill development. NCR's Professional Services division is an exciting place for those who enjoy a fast-paced and ever-evolving industry. The projects are engaging and the opportunities to work with a diverse clientele are enriching.","However, some may find that the company's organizational structure can be somewhat disorganized. The fast-paced nature of the work often requires adaptability and a certain level of self-direction. Yet, it can sometimes pose challenges for those who thrive in more structured environments. This aspect might not suit everyone, but for those who appreciate flexibility and can navigate amidst ambiguity, NCR Corporation remains an excellent place to learn and grow in the realm of professional services."
NCR,3.0,"Feb 29, 2024",Company Review,Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,Work life balance is good,Salary does not match market
NCR,1.0,"Jan 8, 2024",Great Pay but miserable life.  ,Sales Representative,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,Work from home. Base pay and commissions are good. Benefits are solid.,You'll be getting texts and calls from their unhappy customers after 5 p.m. and on weekends. Worst company I've ever worked for in regards to management. In just 3 years I've gone through 3 VP's of Sales and 3 Sales Managers. Over 200% turnover on my team of 20 people and to date nobody is still employed that I worked with. I was literally the Last of the Mohicans. NCR does not have their stuff together and the recently just outsourced (1.5 years ago) all of their internal processes and sales support to other countries like Siberia. It takes over a week to get quotes approved and management has no idea what their doing. Stay away from NCR unless you really like having extra doses of stress.

They train you fully and give you all the tools/equipment you will need. Very good union contract which guarantees you generous sick days, vacation time, overtime, and many other quality-of-life perks.","The base pay, while certainly not bad, isnt great either. With overtime you will make a lot but when overtime is slow you wont make as much. Also, if you are in a non-unionized area you will have very little say over how many hours you work each day and will have no contract protections. Also, if not in the union areas there is ""pay for performance"" which basically means you get a 1% raise every few years because the metrics they use to measure your performance are totally rigged.

NCR,4.0,"Jun 5, 2023","Amazing Company, Employees, & Management...just one big flaw.",Business Development Representative (BDR),"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Saint Petersburg, FL",Work-life balance is great! Everyone you meet within the company is always willing to help you. CEO & CFO are phenomenal people. They truly care about their employees.,"Very little training and unrealistic quotas. Especially when the entire company isn't hitting their quota for the year. Will put employees into positions they don't want to be moved to, but have no choice if they want to keep their jobs with NO training at all and then will lay them off if they aren't performing the way they want within the first 4 months of being in that position. Even though, people in that same position for almost 1 year are getting by with no sales, either. Interesting."
NCR,3.0,"Sep 18, 2023",Overall Stable Work Environment with Difficult Path to Growth,Consultant,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Atlanta, GA","I have always been able to find new opportunities at NCR. Where I demonstrate initiative and interest, I have had success and plenty of managers and leaders willing to offer up a project. Despite a large, corporate, ""gossip"" environment, overall my work is quite drama free and focused on delivering results.","The process to raises, promotions, etc. has been a pretty nebulous one. Despite managers having a pretty clear framework to work off of, the company as a whole is discombobulated in its incentive structure. Hard work oftentimes does not get recognized and even more seldom is it truly rewarded."

NCR,3.0,"Jun 7, 2023",Okay place to start your career,Software Engineer II,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",Dallas-Fort Worth,"Has a mix of both newer and older tech, and is moving toward cloud technology. There is decent amount of opportunity for someone who is driven to excel. Work-life balance is basically what you make it. Laid back culture and some pretty good, dedicated people to work with. Solid engineering management who understand technology. Good place to start a career, but be careful not to get placed on dated technology for too long.","Bad at making sure their lower level engineers get promoted beyond L2 to more senior positions. Really have to make yourself known and keep yourself relevant in order for decent raises and promotions to even be likely. Bad corporate culture when higher ups are trying to justify layoffs. Hybrid work, on which the policy has shifted from 2 to 3 days per week in office for everyone, regardless of role. Company is dead-set on RTO even when it doesn't make sense. Pay is pretty sub-par for industry standard. They will tend to make you work beyond your station for years before a promotion, if it ever even comes. Dedicated QA has been virtually wiped out in favor of automated testing, and before automated testing was able to be properly implemented."
