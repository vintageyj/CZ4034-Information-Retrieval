Good if you want to learn the basics of Cybersecurity. Great if you want to be part of a global company, where everyone runs around like a chick with the head cut off. I loved Acronis from afar for several years. I was thrilled to become part of the team, and imagine how completely let down I felt, when I realized what Acronis really was. Excellent benefits and PTO Working remotely was wonderful. Best engineers you will find.","I really think there are too many to list, but I will try: -Please NOTE- Patrick is NOT the CEO and has not been for a bit. -Pay is very much below industry average. You are not paid near what your experience is worth. Lowest in the industry by far. -Upper management always fibs, and has no loyalty to their direct reports. -HR and upper level execs are in league, so if you ever need anything, or need to report something that is affecting you, nothing will be done, and you will be reprimanded for speaking up. -Company grew way too fast in the last year, making up role titles, and hiring people off the street to fill these roles, only for it all to end badly. They are trying to ""puff up"" to look good for a sale or going public. -You are forced to sign a new KPI/ Sales quota/ target attainment agreement each quarter. Sometimes twice a quarter. -Commissions are capped. -You do not get your ""bonus/ comm"" for weeks, sometimes months, after the end of a quarter. -Despite what has been circulated, Acronis is a Russian company, with Russian founders and owners, period. -New CEO, 3 days in, company wide layoff's. -Acronis blows money on things that are NOT needed and not profitable, instead of investing in Acronis and its employees. -Acronis' mission statement is NOT partner aligned or focused at all. -Acronis will not invest in a stateside support team, and this has caused a huge rift with partners. They can not get support on the line when they need it, as it is all across seas. The support team is lazy, and even when directed to call a partner, they will not. They continue to email and send video's and KB articles. Not a professional means of communication or assistance to partner's at all."

Their messaging and support often do not align and if you get caught in between the two parties you are screwed.

The 1am meetings followed by 7am meetings the following day seem a good place. This is a global company without regional division, which means you will be expected to work around the clock. You will have to sleep during the day to get any sleep at all. 

Executive management is concerned only with growth, even if at the expense of employee health, and without regard to feasibility. Despite being told ""no,"" sales will promise moon to earn and keep business (which is difficult sometimes), and you will be forced to work your knuckles to the bone to make it happen. When it fails, as you said it would, you will still take heat because leadership does not stand up for its employees. 

There is no clear vision, no process. Hope you enjoy spending 4-8 hours a week doing nothing but PowerPoint, because it seems to be the only way information is communicated. Documentation isn't kept, let alone read.

There is no such thing as work life balance here. You will be subject to meetings at every hour of the day. Say no? You're not a team player. 

Hiring practices are in utter disarray, as the criminally understaffed HR cannot get a job offer to a candidate in time for them to accept it. By the time one goes out, they've likely moved on.

The headquarters are just a smoke screen for the real culture behind the company. As for ""Cyber Protection"", good luck with that.

Acronis,5.0,"Mar 14, 2018",Marketing,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Burlington, MA","Acronis is a perfect place to take your career to the next level, gain global experience and learn the market. 
If you are looking to develop yourself and learn new things -  this is the best place.  It's so easy to make an impact and all the results are visible because everything is so transparent. Competence and excellence are recognized and rewarded.
 
It's not about who you know or what team you're working for — if you do amazing things here, it will be seen and acknowledged. It doesn't matter whom you report to, what level you are, or when you started here – if you are consistent, responsive, willing to help, and do your job well, you will thrive.
 
Personally, Acronis was a perfect match for my character. I like how management is not afraid to change things up and try new things. The company is moving fast and executives are never bored. Having the ability to make decisions and take responsibility for them was really refreshing compared to my previous companies.  Mistakes can be made in such a fast pace, so you have to be able to acknowledge, fix it and move on. 
There are no limits to what you can do here –   you are able to do what you can and want, which moves you closer to the edge of your capabilities and constantly pushes your boundaries. It is a great place to learn business strategy and participate in decision making that has material impact.","Because of the speed, there are frequent changes in org structure.

It doesn't happen overnight, but many of those who continue to work hard and deliver results are given more responsibilities and opportunities.
Each position has an individual contributor aspect (even at higher levels) which means you must be hands on and willing to do a lot of work yourself. Due to the size and nature of the company, most roles cover multiple areas of their department and business. This gives you more ownership of the work, career growth, and development. It also means you can see the impact of your work and know that you were the person who delivered (or helped) those results. 
Another plus is that Acronis is worldwide, which allows you to work with different people, cultures, and regions. 
In all, Acronis has given me so much over the last 3 + years - a career, a family, long lasting relationships, and unforgettable memories.","Acronis is not for everyone because it is a fast-paced environment with higher than average workloads and responsibilities. There also have been some changes in management that have caused a little turbulence throughout the years here. But if you can manage the changes, fast pace and heavy workload, Acronis will benefit you so much. 
The work can be challenging and stressful, but nothing worthwhile is ever easy :-)"

The software is also incredible. The product should be so easy to sell!","The CEO has spent way too much money on F1 marketing to keep up with other Russian software companies - and the employees are paying for it. The pay is below average salaries in the area. A handful of managers and VP level people have been let go and we no longer have company get-togethers to foster those ""team building"" relationships.

Here are few reasons I enjoy my time here:

- Diversity & the people: companies often tout how diverse their workplace is, but often they ""try hard"" to hire diverse groups of people. At Acronis, it comes naturally - you get to meet people from all around the world and continuously learn from one another.

- Fast-paced environment: you'll never get bored as things are always changing, but that doesn't mean we don't have fun along the way.

- Your opinion matters: It doesn't matter what position or level you're in - your opinion will matter when it comes to projects - you're on a team!

- And some other superficial things in the office: pool tables, snacks, unlimited caffeine by Boston Coffee Company...","We're a growing company with some growing pains (with our [legacy] systems).

Our Acronis global Team is very diverse, we have 18 offices across the global, with varieties of cultures and nationalities. Understanding cultural differences helps overcome communication challenges at work. Currently, my team works across all time zones including Grater Boston Area, Munich, Moscow, Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney. As I am in a global role, I have to stay connected with my peers and be able to support their business needs. I value that global experience, as it provides me with understandings of how different markets operate.

The other great part is a technology side. We are early adopters of cutting-edge technologies. I am getting invaluable and sometimes unique experience that increases my tech skills. I am getting deep understanding in products and technologies we develop. 

Last but not least, is a fun part. We try to keep our offices connected through our social media channels by sharing their team and individual pictures with hashtag #AcronisPeople on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. I am keen to know, what is a life looks like in our other offices. That is a fun part, but very important to keep global team connected.",Life-time balance sometimes is hard to active due to projects and different times zones.

During my time, I've had the opportunity to work in different departments. It's a great place to work and has helped me understand company structure and the business side of things, which in my opinion, is great exposure to help carry on in any future position. While I love my position, the great healthcare benefits, and the perks/incentives (we have snacks in the kitchen, F1 gaming simulators and a Foosball table - come on!), the people are what make this Company outstanding. They surprised me with a Bridal Shower right before my wedding, sent flowers to the funeral home when my family member passed away and continuously show appreciation for my efforts. The healthcare benefits are also really great and they truly care about what employees would like to see (for example, they now offer a 401(k) match after many inquiries). With a pre-existing condition and having numerous medical appointments, I've never been more thankful and appreciative for the insurance coverage Acronis has to offer. Overall, I'd recommend this Company without a doubt.","Internal systems could be better - as with any global company, it can be hard to find systems that have the capability to function globally; but it is something they are working on"

Unfortunately, they either don't last or aren't allowed to effectively do their jobs. The technology is valuable and the products good. The product lines are confusing to work through but are good. If compensation is your only goal and you can ""work"" your way into the ""inner circle"" this company drastically overpays.","This is easily the most mismanaged company I have ever come across. The lack of effective leadership and accountability is extraordinary. The phrase ""top heavy"" describes Acronis. However, they don't even have the right people in those leadership positions. There is no effective channel of communications established. There is no accountability. With effective leadership, this could be an extremely profitable company. What you know doesn't matter at Acronis but rather who you know."

They are way over their heads and it shows.  CEO and sales exec VP are a cartoon. They treat employees like gerbils on a treadmill.  Mid-level management is good but gets little help from the top.

Nice base salary

Leads provided for you - no cold calling -

Snacks/meals/luncheons provided often","Unfortunately,I have a few items to discuss here.  I really want to like everything about this company, but there are a few areas that must be improved quickly.  

First, the company has sort of a start up feel, since they are regrouping after many years. However policies and procedures are extremely disorganized and subjective. Professionalism is lacking in that sense. Answers are given one day on something, only to be changed the next day.


Also, The base salaries are good, but the quotas are unreasonable, and slightly demotivating in your efforts to reach them. Although you make a decent base salary, it’s rather hard to hit your on target earnings.  Higher payout for commissions is highly recommended, to provide more motivation for the employees. If it means a slightly lower base salary, that is something to consider, but I think the current commission structure is not designed properly for full motivation and commitment.  

The overall management/attitude is not where it needs to be. It’s a very black and white culture, almost like a dictatorship, There’s no fairness when it comes to making decisions on discrepancies that can happen from time to time. They treat you more like objects, then human beings. This is my biggest concern, and I hope this can be addressed quickly. .  Genuine compassion, support, and fair treatment needs to be implemented to really grow this company to the next level.  Just use common sense and treat people how you would like to be treated ."
