Amdocs,4.0,"Jan 22, 2024","Great career growth opportunities, but you need to be lucky to have a good manager",Platform Manager,"Former Employee, more than 10 years",Ra`ananna,"Amdocs is a big international company, you will face professional challenges thanks to that that will sharpen your skills and experience.
The company also invest a lot in employee experience and in changing the image of it in the tech industry, unlimited vacation is one example.","You need to be lucky to have a good manager.. managerial style is not a value in focus in the company hence your work climate can vary dramatically per unit.
Because of that 
- many managers manage up - look up to their ""bonus provider"" and less on the benefit of their managed teams.
- you may see old style managers, being rude and aggressive to their people as if we didn't learn anything since the 90's ...
I used to think this is a result of the company size, but now I know its a matter of values in focus.
Promotions are not always available, no matter how appreciated you are."

from darkest to the brightest. I would not elongate this post with fancy words 
1. Amdocs offers free breakfast ( fruits and heavy breakfasts/ evening snacks) But you can only enjoy these if your managment is composed, otherwise you get free pressure with all of these.
So bad that, at times I could see people enjoy everything, while we were having meetings/ useless sessions etc.

4. Invests in future tech","High work pressure
Bad management
Some employees were layed off
Even one of my team mates was put on PIP and then he was layed off
1. Fake promises of Onsite

In my case I haven't effective opportunity to get a position in another department. I'd be the worst one to advice here, but it was pretty much of despondency to leave the office that glares with posters ""Amdocs family"". I didn't feel like there was the effort of HR to solve the issue and do the best keeping me company's employee. 
Another thing to mention - the company employed an open-space solution for the office. There are both supporters and opponents of the approach - I'd say it depends, but my personal preference would be an ability of choice."

People were silently let go in market down time using PIP and then asked to self resign. The company environment in 2023 early layoffs was scary. - Once layoff was done, started hiring freshers with 10-13LPA while people with even 3-4 years experience were making less than them and mentoring these expensive freshers. - Management always shows everything is spotless and then suddenly starts breaking bombs like “No one in company will get any hike” - happened for FY 2023"
