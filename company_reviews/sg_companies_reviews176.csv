MongoDB,5.0,"Jan 16, 2024",A Year of Growth and Empowerment: Reflecting on My Journey at MongoDB,Senior Solutions Architect,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"During my past year in MongoDB, I have witnessed firsthand the company's remarkable growth and expansion. And it's exciting to be part of an organization that is constantly reaching new heights. 
Here are some points that I would consider as Pros: 
1. Comprehensive training resources for new hires to ramp up the knowledge. You dont have to be an expert in database or cloud computing domain to join the company, as long as you are willing to take the challenge and keep learning. 
2. Consistent behavior exhibited by its leadership team, both internally and in public presence. 
3. MongoDB is relatively in smaller scale in my region, but it also means you will be granted more responsibilities to experience, and also experiment new process, new industry, new customers with strong support from internal teams.
4. Product-oriented approach and really care about the developer community and customer feedbacks.","1. Sometimes in daily work, you do have to play one-man bank to take care of different tasks that might not technically ""in-scope"" of your role. 
2. You may need to work or have meetings in hours that not favor your timezone due to the distribution of the global team."
MongoDB,3.0,"Feb 7, 2024",Cool place to work if you are not a partner.,Partner Consultant,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,Everyone is amiable and helpful when you need help or learn something.,"If you work as a partner, you'll always be stuck in your position, there is no place to grow, and all the jobs that are boring or the MongoDB employees don't want to do will be allocated to you. They will always allocate good clients or interesting consulting sessions to their own team, so it's hard to learn something new or work on a cool project. 
But the most demotivating thing is the no-compete agreement with the companies that hire the partners. If you apply for any open position at MongoDB, they won't schedule an interview, even if you're one of the best partner consulting engineers in the company with an overstanding knowledge of MongoDB."

MongoDB,1.0,"Feb 15, 2024",Horrible workplace ,Technical Program Manager,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","New York, NY",Free lunches and snacks in the office.,"The atmosphere at MongoDB is challenging, with inexperienced engineers promoted to leadership roles lacking necessary experience. There's a lack of emotional intelligence training, and communication seems belittling. It feels like a situation where individuals with inflated egos, akin to children, are managing the company. The dynamic suggests engineers and product teams dominate, while others are perceived as mere minions. Expressing new ideas is met with swift dismissal and sometimes negative labeling.

The technical program director appears unresponsive to feedback, sticking to outdated methods. Instead of fostering an open environment, she retaliates when confronted and lacks a strong engineering background. During culture amp surveys for anonymous feedback, she conducted meetings to identify contributors, even alluding to potential repercussions for her livelihood. Despite notifying HR, no actions were taken."

MongoDB,1.0,"Jan 23, 2024","Refund on my ""MBA of Sales""",Enterprise Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Seattle, WA",Pretty good training. All virtual though.,"Almost all of your success will be tied to your accounts. The other piece of your success is how well you can game the system and look busy to your leader. Most leaders, especially the VP level, are former order takers at the business, who are not good when it comes to advice or sales strategies. The biggest bro culture I have ever seen, if you're not in the club, good luck. If you are, you'll get the best accounts and all of the opps from the people not in the bro club who left. 

Being an Enterprise AE here without a hot patch is about the same day-to-day and pay as an SDR.

They talk a big game about their sales process and MBA of sales, but it seems that is to get reps in the door and convince reps to stay. In my experience since, the sales org is not highly regarded externally. Take a look at all of the people who have left within the past year. I've never seen an exodus like this before."
MongoDB,2.0,"Jan 26, 2024",Bro sales culture and moving targets,Customer Success Manager,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Austin, TX","Great product
Smart teams and leaders","Micromanaging

Intense ""bro"" sales culture

My comp structure changed every quarter I worked there and I didn't know my metrics for the first month of the quarter - moving target.

You're never good enough mentality - even if you hit your number every quarter, they want to know what you could have done better, why didn't you ask X questions and how can you improve next time. While that can help with self-reflection and growth, when you are never recognized for accomplishments and only pushed to reflect on what you didn't do, it can be demotivating. There needs to be a balance."

We are seeing a lot of people leave because of this. Also the intellectual honesty is disappearing. Instead of doing lay offs like every other company in the tech space, they are having bar raising, then underperforming conversations and managing people out as a result.

There is no transparency in the process. We had to wait over 8 months to get $20K that was contractually obligated but they failed to pay. The senior management is focused on cost-savings initiatives and cares little for the employees well being. The West Coast in particular is understaffed and way overworked. If you are female - you are paid less than your male counterparts. There is very little representation of females to men in the sales organization. People are leaving right and left due to the toxic nature of the management team. The senior management is stuck on how things were when they were individual contributors and fail to grasp how the markets, products, number of competitors and space has changed. Issues were raised to senior levels of management and HR and HR only supports the toxic managers. There is no room for growth in the role or within the division unless you want to become a Sales Rep."

Sales leadership exhibits a highly toxic culture. 2. Excessive micromanagement, frequent unnecessary meetings, and round-the-clock messages from the directors. 3. Top performing Sales directors and Account Executives do not contribute to sales; instead, they manipulate the system (sfdc) to take credit and commissions for the accounts in different regions outside India. 4. The growth team is equally redundant since the product practically sells itself, resulting in the labeling of new clusters and organic growth as upsells. 5. The leadership endorses and supports these unscrupulous practices, with the exception of the new AVP in the region who might not even know of all this in detail."

Opportunity to grow your professional network","Where do I begin? This place was once pretty decent years ago, but even then it was a tough place to be from a culture and quota attainment perspective. If you’re a minority of any kind you will likely be the only one in the room if not one of a handful. Expect to be micro managed and work well over 50 hours a week if you want to be viewed as a good employee. Overly complex comp structure that only a small percentage of people actually hit. Lots of bad managers have ended up in middle management positions across sales, customer success, and sales dev. You cannot share feedback unless it’s positive but you have to subject yourself to feedback of any kind at all times. Sales org is a walking HR violation (I saw this in another review) as it’s only men who all look the same. There’s zero diversity of any kind across most regions and they refuse to acknowledge this or do anything meaningful about it. Sales execs and senior leadership leaving left and right over the past 18 months and it looks like that trend is continuing. Managers only care about the numbers and nothing more. You have no room to be person. My manager was responsible for 4 people either asking to leave their team, or who ended up quitting, and that manager is still with the company. Sales org is a good ole boys club and those who fall in line or get close to the right people will get good accounts, grace, and actual mentoring. Customer success org doesn’t seem to be much better. I’ve heard horror stories from other regions about women getting push back for wanting to take their full maternity leave or coming back after leave with all new accounts, etc. The most toxic and exhausting QBR experience with people regularly suffering from massive amounts of stress and anxiety or going to the bathroom to cry. Full of mind games. Also, no team building events besides binge drinking. If they want you gone they will push you until you just quit. Also, the pay is below the standard for sales execs now…If I can sum up this place in a few words: just a traumatizing boys club full of egos that are stuck in an echo chamber of their own beliefs."

Seriously, you learn so much useful stuff. - Awesome culture. - Big company but operates in a spokes-and-hubs fashion, so each office feels like a small startup. - Generous compensation and benefits. - Sensible middle and senior management.","Consulting engineering, which is the delivering role of MongoDB's Professional Services, is a very demanding role. Customer work has somewhat strict hours - you're dedicated to a single customer on a given day and work with them until late afternoon. After that, you must collect and tidy up your detailed notes before they're sent to the customer. Long story short, 9-5 won't cut it here. This creates a tricky situation for working parents in an egalitarian relationship who wish to see their kids during the week and not offload pickup to someone else. Keep that in mind and ask your hiring manager about how flexible the daily routine is for consultants. In the first few weeks in the role, I felt a little lost and almost lost my faith in my ability to do it just because of the daily agenda."

HR Teams are equally immature with no accountability or tools to mitigate instances of workplace bias and mental harassment. 4. Women bully women - cannot generalize this as I met some inspiring people but my direct manager was a complex case of bullying, micromanagement, microaggression, false sense of authority especially towards brown women subordinates and a general lack of integrity. 5. Lack of trust, team building, acknowledgments and good morale. 6. No career planning or KPI tracking. Faulty methods of performance evaluation. 7.

Pains with this now can be seen in slow moving internal processes and having to deal with the ""multiple chefs in the ktichen"" problem e.g. so many people are now involved in making decisions and have opinions on features/functionality that things move really slow. That said it isn't unique to MongoDB, I would think most companies of this size (over 5,000 employees) have these issues."

MongoDB,3.0,"Nov 22, 2023","Started great, then steadily declined in its culture",Senior Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","New York, NY","Smart people, competitive compensation, bi-weekly retrospectives on processes and team work, quarterly onsites, and interesting projects. There are still some great people working here, but there are also those who ruin it for everyone else, as you'll see in the cons section.","While the company started out mostly great when I joined, many projects were not planned out correctly and resulted in gross underestimation, while churn relieved its original participants from any accountability. This only becomes apparent over time, but by the time one realizes the predicament they are in, they are too heavily invested and overworked to crawl out of it. Its famed culture started to decline soon after the arrival of several top level executives from Amazon, and once tech layoffs became fashionable, management blissfully declared that no layoffs were planned but instead ""raised the bar"" by vastly reducing the number of overperformers during each review cycle and enforced that 5% must be underperformers. Indeed, the culture continued its rapid descent while the company took on more and more former Amazon executives.

To be fair, promotions were rampant and many people who were not ready for their new roles were promoted too quickly to begin with. Perhaps this was seen as a way to combat the rapid rise, but did little to deal with people who were already in those roles; there were plenty of 'leaders' who are in no position to lead others. These people remained in positions of power while themselves underperformed, and are now pressured to deliver or streamline their costs. This resulted in making demands on their teams that started to overstep reasonable expectations, pushing those team members into the ""underperform"" category and finally managing them out with a performance improvement plan, despite performing well in every other metric, resulting in termination without severance. Culture, innovation, and work life balance now take a backseat at this company, but I suspect this is only the beginning."
MongoDB,3.0,"May 24, 2023",Query Team - Hard Time for Junior Engineers,Junior Software Engineer,Current Employee,,"- Vast majority of employees are extremely friendly and approachable. Everyone is knowledgeable and intelligent. - The work is interesting! The projects are very well thought out despite the problems being so difficult. - Code quality is mostly high. There's a lot of tech debt, but with time this will go away. This is a great company if you want to improve your C++ skills.","- Team choice is a coinflip. You can have a lead that is very available and will help you with career growth, or one that is invisible. Most leads are too busy with technical work to pay close enough attention to give feedback. Many junior engineers do not get any negative feedback unless they remind their lead many times. There are a few cases where promotions have been implied, but then at the last minute negative feedback is provided and no promotion is given. This is a hard situation to navigate for a junior engineer. - For the most productive engineers, bad behavior is ignored. These engineers are so knowledgeable and crucial to certain projects that consistently bad behavior is overlooked. They can be condescending and unapproachable with no repercussions. Many junior engineers avoid them, even though they are often the best person to ask questions. If you are on a team with one of these individuals and don't have another senior engineer to go to for questions, your career growth will be stunted. If you do ask them questions, they will give a bad performance review to your lead. Difficult situation for junior engineers."

You will learn a lot here. I can't speak highly enough of Dev Ittycheria the CEO, he is the real deal. Work culture is great, supporting a hybrid model (where remote work is allowed but in person is definitely encouraged in the hubs like HQ in NYC).","The Sales org runs the company, other business functions play second fiddle. Whiplash may arise when the sales leaders return from their annual offsite and present a new framework to the rest of the company. (but it's also a strength in that the Mongo sales team is probably in the top 5% tech sales cultures in the industry.) Where it can come into play is from a resourcing standpoint. Expect that if your team is not in Sales, you will run super lean. Secondly, as the company has become quite established (and big), many of the processes are fully built out. Depending on the org you are in, you may be more of an ""operator"" vs an ""innovator"". This comes down to personal preference on what you are looking for. But it definitely felt like a big company when I left, which wasn't the case when I joined."

Too many supporting roles with very narrow breadth of responsibilities. This role can be eliminated completely, if they give training to Account executives or Solutions architects, or Consult engineers who actually deliver the work. Leadership is only focused on numbers and not their team. Very poor gender and diversity ratios. Very slow growth potential, especially if you are a person of color. Poor succession planning. Strangely enough the senior leadership keeps getting promoted, yet they keep doing the same job and nothing changes down the line. Poor feedback culture. Managers/Leaders will not help with personal growth. Huge dependency on account executives. Also, as soon as you join, the employee experience team will ask you to drop a review on glassdoor. Most reviews here are when people are in their very early days of employment, so take it with a pinch of salt."

If you have experienced discrimination because of your gender or for any other reason, that is wrong. With that said, I am a female who has been with MongoDB for 5 years in a variety of sales roles. I have personally felt incredibly supported throughout my time at this company. The sales teams here are top-notch and are full of talented people who I continue to learn from. Sales at MongoDB will challenge you, but it will also be rewarding. Don't get me wrong, there is no question that the number of men in sales outweighs the number of women. However, leadership has acknowledged the disparity and is seemingly putting in a genuine effort to bridge the gap. We have amazing affiliate groups like MDBWomen's Group and Sell Like a Girl which have created opportunities for females and allies to network and find mentors across MongoDB. I'm always humbled to see that senior leadership regularly participates in these events. I'm not sure what other company can say that their female CISO regularly attends affiliate group mentorship events - you're setting an amazing example, Lena.
