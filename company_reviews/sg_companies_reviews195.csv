You have a feeling you are among your equals","Company is going through crisis, 3rd year in a row. And in 3rd reorg of leadership, they put on Group Head position for Sales and Delivery a guy who started as trainee in Zuhlke 10y ago. 90% of leaders grew in Zuhlke, and only Zuhlke, With constant communication 'you are the best' from day one, they really think they are. And by moving up the ladder, every 2 years and even less (just because they did a good a job) they are actually becoming God, flawless. Instead of dealing with redefining the Strategy and Operational goals, Group heads are spending their expensive time on setting up the knowledge base, role definitions and knowledge sharing sessions... I could go for pages on all of the leadership antipatterns I witnessed e.g. micromanagement, not trusting your employees, no 'fail early' culture, no 'reduce the waste' mindset therefore absolutely non optimal risk management and as one of the consequences slow decision making, reaching consensus in large group of people, favorizing opinion of employees who are longer in the company, not defined business processes, not even core ones like Sales..."

They are the one refused to adapt. They re-shuffle on their own under the name of `change`. 

People adapt and learn, but they can't apply because of that strategy. 

Quite a number of people pointed out about that, but ignored. 
Sit at the top of the chain and reject good ideas from the employees. Yet, no responsibility."
Zühlke,1.0,"Jan 10, 2024","Bad culture, no plans, discriminatory",Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Singapore,"From benefits perspective, they offer SRS payment to expats and allowance for your insurance.

There are good engineering talents scattered throughout but they are rare.

Good work life balance","Management is a hit or miss, mostly a miss in terms of competency. For 5 years, no one came up with a tangible plan. It's always we are working on it. 

Yes, working on it until they have to lay off half to three quarter of the people they hired since 2021.

Management play favourite when it comes to the people: whether to keep or layoff. In part, there is an appearance of discrimination/racism. Majority of the people who are laid off are either locals or Asian."

The architects and consultant didn't have proper skillset to do the job. But they were the one in charge. And they insisted to drive the whole team to wrong direction, which later on caused so many troubles. We losed money, recruited too many engineers, messed up the system/project. After everything, we losed money and company needed to lay off people. So many knowledgeable and talented engineers have been laid off. But all the blind leaders and all the bad engineers who messed up the project are still here! Upper level people asked for retro, but they just never reach mid-bottom level staff to hear the truth."

A good variety of projects to work on for various industries. Strong emphasis on learning new skills, and there are regularly training courses you can attend. Work life balance is good, and there are plenty of events organized if you like to be social or learn something outside your usual sphere of knowledge.","The large variety of projects may mean that you work outside of your usual tech stack sometimes, but they try to match you up with the role as well as possible.

Zühlke,3.0,"Aug 20, 2023",A pretty meh work place,Lead Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Sofia, Sofia (city)",On the engineering staff level the company generally does a pretty good job at hiring people with good attitude which results in a very good culture.,The company's HQ is in Switzerland and they expanded from there to different locations. It often feels like employees from non-swiss locations are treated as second class citizens. The most hilarious thing of all is that the company takes pride it only hires the top 5% of software engineers while is nowhere near close to paying top 5% salaries.

Zühlke,5.0,"Oct 3, 2022",Great company overall,Advanced Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Hong Kong,"Certain degree of freedom in choosing projects:
Zuhlke has clients in different fields (mainly medical and financial institutions), it is completely OK to voice out your preference for projects.

Friendly colleagues and good culture:
People here are nice and supportive. Peer engineers are highly capable and easy to work with. There are regular social events to build up team bonding.

No micromanagement:
There is no micromanagement here and your line manager gives you the autonomy to work on your own. However it may not be the same case for the project leaders in client.

Unique benefits:
Being able to work remotely outside of HK (under permission of client) is not something you can find everywhere.

Expanding network:
You will be meeting different people in different clients and be able to expand your network.","On bench from time to time:
Sometimes there is just no projects which fits you and you will be on bench between projects. You may have a feeling of not being needed (and it is absolutely not your fault).

Salary not so competitive:
The salary does not really match with permanent bank staff.

Relatively difficult to get promoted:
Client feedback contributes a large portion in determining your performance, but not all the clients are willing to give you a lengthy/thorough feedback to reflect it. Besides that, there are ""extra-miles"" you will have to cover (eg. hosting knowledge-sharing sessions) to secure a promotion. Being great at client project solely does not cut."

Zühlke,5.0,"Feb 28, 2023",Empowering ideas!,Expert Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Singapore,Zuhlke offers a great opportunity to work with various technologies (new and old) applied in various industries internationally in different team setups and roles. This also means that you should be open to leave your comfort zone for a project engagement that might not use your dream tech stack. Employees are empowered and expected to own and drive their career and have a great deal of freedom and flexibility in doing so. The career model expects that engineers engage in various activities beside coding and that they focus on the value we bring to our clients.,"Be prepared to face and work on the same issues (organizational challenges, communication issues, legacy code, bad quality code) in every client project engagement after every rotation. It's the nature of working in a consultancy. 

The offered trainings in various areas are rather limited. It would be desirable to have an internal training portfolio with regular workshops and courses given by employees."

Multi cultural/ diversified employers (but you will not work with them). You might see/meet them during only company events as you will be working for different clients 3. Good if you are coming from other country so you can start your career in Singapore as they do remote interviews and hire.","1. It is a consultancy firm. Meaning they will hire you and deploy in a client office (like an agency). Of course you will have to pass the client interviews and if not you will be on the bench. 2. Most of the time, you will not have a say in which technology/ project you will be working on. You will be just a contract employee with the client. 3. As you are working outside zuhlke office full-time(with clients directly), you will not inherit so called best culture. 4. your contribution will not be visible too as you are working for external client project. 5. Lack of visibility meaning, you will not be recognised. Eventually it might affect your increments/ bonus etc.. 6. Favourism there for europeans mostly. Management think they are the core, They will elevate them to lead positions easily and dump everybody else or dont care about others. 7. Lots of employer branding in social media, but reality is different. 8. High turnover in staff movement. Mostly people work around 1 year."

Zühlke,4.0,"May 25, 2022",Probably the best consultant firm you can find in Hong Kong,Expert Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Hong Kong,"- Work life balance definitely. Although it's a consultant firm they strongly encourage work life balance and enforce it as much as they can. 

- Cutting edge tech and loads of best practices. You'll get to work with loads of awesome, smart, and amazing engineers and you will definitely learn a whole lot from them.

- Trust and support from management. They trust you with the work and with the way you work. Unlike traditional hk companies, they trust you when you call in sick (no doctor's note), they trust that you'll deliver on time. No micromanagement. They give you a plenty of freedom.

- They respect their engineers and they reward their engineers. Definitely a no blame culture and they try to understand the situation whenver something goes wrong. 

- Awesome, fun, and diverse culture. If you're tired of local HK culture, this is the place to be","- It is a consultant firm so it's difficult to avoid bad clients. Zuhlke management did they best to be selective and pick out the best projects for their engineers but every now and then they'd end up with a client who'd lie about the nature and the actual work of the project. (Chances are low, I just happened to be unlukcy)

- Salary is average. It's a good salary if you're not already in the banking industry. They can definitely be more competitive in their pay.

- Hong Kong reports to Singapore. I understand that they're trying to unify the standard across Asia but it's not quite fair to have those sitting in Singapore to evaulate you when you're sitting in Hong Kong and they know nothing about you."

Also, the company has grown a lot, many ""old"" people left and many new ones came, so it's definitely not the same as it used to be. It's a service provider, with many different clients and projects and technologies, but an employee can't really influence the decision what their next project is going to be."
Zühlke,5.0,"Jun 24, 2022",A great company to work for,Agile Project Manager,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Singapore,"At Zuhlke you'll often get exposed to really challenging projects, and sometimes demanding customers. But you will also receive tremendous supports from your managers, team mates, seniors which makes you feel that there's no problems that we cannot resolve. The people and support you'll get at Zuhlke will make it one of the best places to work for!

Zuhlke invests heavily in their employees, in the form of mentorship, training opportunities and gives employees a lot of empowerment on how they'd like to shape the future of the company.

The people are fun, and have a great sense of humor!",I can't think of any cons at this point in time.

Zühlke,5.0,"Apr 25, 2022",The best company I have worked for in 2 decades,Principal Consultant,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,One of the best places for the passionate engineers to develop in multiple dimensions. With a lot of career opportunities as the company is rapidly growing. Unmatched support from team leads and sponsored training from the company. An engineering company run by engineers.,Don't expect a top-down management style. This is for people who want to take full ownership of their job. This is not for people who want to stay in their comfort zone as learning and growing only happen when we feel uncomfortable and being challenged.
