Murex,2.0,"Nov 18, 2015",A Great Company - But not in the Americas,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","New York, NY","World leading software (although now aging) and some of the brightest people you'll ever meet. If you do well here you're good. Generally excellent benefits.
Probably the nicest group of owners you'll ever meet (in Paris).  For younger members of staff there's a lot done of social events (parties, events, breakfasts) many of which are of a high quality.","Changes in senior management have changed the culture of the New York office. There is an increased level of churn in the staff - in particular longer term employees have been moving out - as the focus has moved to a younger/offshore sourced team. High usage of offshore hiring, not to the benefit of local staff. Work hours can be brutal and while many of the line managers are excellent technologists they have little if any experience in managing people. General situation is that people arrive - are very happy in the first 2-3 years and then become restless."

If you get along with the right people, you can get away with murder. Especially if you speak French. No attention to junior consultants. Salary is bad considering the work hours needed. Some incredibly arrogant, insecure and rude people in senior management."

Good Travel opportunities and benefits
smart people and collegial atmosphere","Some managers are downright arrogant, disrespectful, and unprofessional
With few exceptions, managers lack basic people and management skills
Compensation could be better and end of year bonus is arbitrary
Career development non-existent
Senior management lacks leadership to motivate and communicates poorly with the base
Long hours comparable to working at IB or HF but with less pay"
Murex,3.0,"Dec 30, 2013","Tough as steel, unstructured and political environment - Not for the faint of heart!",Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,,"Good experience right out of school and after in financial services

Broad range of clients - can sample the full spectrum of financial services, asset managers, hedge funds, investment banks, regional banks, insurance companies - you name it

With the right team and right client(s), one can great exposure across the entire spectrum of trading business especially on the front office consulting side.

Very capable people with some that are truly extra-ordinary

Decent pay","Very specialized software has its downside. Stay long here and you will find it hard to exit to a career in banking or hedge funds which is what most people here aspire to as a next step in their career. 

Ideal exit point, should you choose to do that, is near the 3-4 year mark. This has more to do with the recruiting in the banking/hedge fund industry that cannot benchmark a role at Murex. 

Average person at Murex is likely to have had broader exposure than an average person at a bank in a given period of time. However this is not widely recognized. People have made later exits into banking or hedge funds but not without taking a role at least initially that is lower in stature than their roles and responsibilities at Murex.

There is a risk of being pigeon-holed. Despite the fact that different people do different things at Murex, to the outside world everyone is a Murex consultant.

Very Paris-centered and especially so for top level roles. This is a big downer for talented people at satellite offices.

Have to watch your back, especially with mid level managers that are very insecure. Be prepared to be stabbed in the back without any warning!

Management at all levels needs work on the behavioral side - starting with how to treat people with respect."

- Free drink and fruits in the kitchen;
- Good benefits (insurance coverage, pension plan, etc.)","- Work environment seems casual, but people can be excessively nervous and sensitive whenever they hear something negative;
- Too much micromanagement and instruction, little liberty to manage your own daily job;
- Not a good career choice for the math/stats/finance major. The only possible career path is IT support or engineer (not even developer);
- Strong focus on vanity projects to win over clients instead of product improvement, innovation and internal process streamlining;
- Senior people seem nice, but are actually hypocritical and deduct employees' bonus and raise whenever they have the chance."
Murex,3.0,"Nov 9, 2013",Great on-the-job learning opportunities,,"Former Employee, more than 8 years",,"In client services departments you are given a lot of exposure to diverse business contacts and cases from multiple clients projects assigned in parallel.

Niche market, not many transferable skills
Outdated tools and technology
They will impose many restrictions when employees want to leave, or go to another company, or work for a competitor, some of the things they would do or say to intimidate employees is questionable in terms of legality

2. That's it.","1. A career path for engineers is non-existent unless you wanna go into management and even then you must work ridiculous hours and suck-up to the right people. 
2. Bonus and raises depend on EOY objectives result, but management only allows for one ""exceeded"" employee per team, so welcome to the hunger games if you wanna have a decent bonus at the end of the year. 
3. Murex tolerates remote work (up to 2 days per week) but does not encourage it. Management and work culture make it clear that it's not appreciated. 
4. Company culture makes you feel bad about ending your day at 6pm. People stay very late and value more staying late at the office than arriving early or finishing yout work in less time. Toxic presenteeism at its finest.

The Boss: He is angry everyday, no politeness, no patience. He doesn't give you an answer but criticizes your ignorance, he doesn't believe you are working unless you come to the office. He can always find something to criticize you because he is happy about that. 2. The Management: there is no clear plan even though we have many useless planning meetings, you have no way to choose what you do and how you do it. 3. The Administrative Manager: he will only give you pressure and push you to do more and more. 4. The Project: Ten million lines of legacy code (created 10 or 15 years ago), thousands of shit tests which may take years to finish ! You have to enjoy your deadline. 5. The Task: Hundreds of fixes waiting for you every day, there is no way to create something or learn something new, your work is to fix old projects. No way ! 6. The Career Path: You can't see any career path, after several years you are still at the beginning !! 7. WLB: You told me about work and life balance ? Are you kidding me ?
