Another thing that I deeply appreciate is the commitment to employee development. There are abundant opportunities for learning and career growth. 

Most importantly, Skyscanner genuinely cares about its employees. The company goes to great lengths to ensure we're not only satisfied with our work but also thriving in all aspects. From flexible working arrangements to mental health support and regular feedback sessions, it's clear that employee well-being is a top priority.","Honestly, it's hard to point out any significant downsides.

Skyscanner,2.0,"Jan 6, 2024","A company with a good culture, but now in stagnation",Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","London, England","· People are nice. Colleagues are respectful, polite and genuinely nice. That and good work-life balance are the reasons why people say Skyscanner has a good culture.

· Good work-life balance. There’s a lot of respect for personal boundaries and work-life balance. If you need time off for your physical health, mental health, or family reasons, everyone understands and encourages you to prioritise yourself and your family.

· Traveller-first approach. People care about the users, and put their needs above the needs of the business. It's a rare and admirable cultural trait for a company that big. 

· Mature product development process. Roadmaps, product hypotheses, success metrics, cross-functional collaboration and stakeholder management.","· People choose to be nice instead of being honest. That's the flip side of the company culture of niceness. People don’t give “negative” feedback and often avoid any type of confrontation. That gets in the way of getting honest work critique, improving product quality and trying to get career development feedback.

· Career progression is almost impossible. It's a bureaucratic, document-heavy, and unclear process. It takes years and almost impossible to do by the book. To get a promotion people focus not on delivering the work, but on visibility and building relationships to be in favour with the right people from the leadership.

· No vision. There is no ambition, no big bets, no ideas for what's next in travel tech. The leadership presents a few design concepts once a year, but they never get built. There are endless conversations to align on ideas and plans, and no one ever takes the responsibility for a decision.

· Hard to be proud of the product. Product across desktop website, mobile website, and mobile apps looks and works incoherently. Since the beginning of COVID many features were shut down, and never turned back on. In the last years very few new features were launched. If you compare Skyscanner's product with competitors, it's severely behind in quality and convenience.

Overall, Skyscanner is a great place to work if you value work-life balance, nice colleagues, and a good salary and benefits. However, if you are ambitious and want to do your best work, grow, and learn, it's not the best fit for you."

One of the main director in this space believes Scrum Masters are Managers so that says it all really. They're also tracking progress using 'Epic Cycle Time' as their main indicator of progress and they have a 40 page software delivery handbook that everyones forced to read when they join and if you ask questions you're immediately pointed back to the handbook. Basically, they've hired people in very senior roles who have very little experience, and everyones been there for a long time so they haven't seen what it's like in other companies. You will also get fired for having a different opinion or pointing out challenges even if it is part of your role as a coach. I wouldn't apply if you're an experienced Agile Coach would be my advise as you'll be flogging a dead horse and they also don't have a strategy either. They only hire people into the role that haven't had a lot of industry exposure so they can mould them to fit Skyscanner. They also over-hired during covid and are at a stuck point for the next 4-5 years in terms of hiring roles they need to address some of their core challenges.

Skyscanner,3.0,"Mar 19, 2023",Good employer overall. Could improve management of staff,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,"Bounced back from the pandemic and retained much of the staff. Staff were incentivised to stay by being given shares in the company. Pay has been really good. Opportunities to progress have been good in the past, these are a bit more limited now given the new shape the business has taken. (See below) I generally feel well cared for as an employee.","Hasn't quite mastered making innovation viable yet Since the pandemic, Skyscanner has re-focused the product development back to its core meta product. This means there isn't too much scope for any fresh, interesting projects for now. This could change in the future. The company has experimented with some innovative products in the past, but ultimately many of them have been eventually shelved. I have worked on several initiatives that were expensive and eventually turned out to be non-viable. This either because the business model was not viable, or the context of travel changed. Skyscanner could benefit by going back to its start up mindset, to test and learn faster. Management is a weakness There are a few really good managers, but their impact and contributions are not rewarded enough. I personally do not feel well managed, in terms of clear expectations being set or getting constructive feedback in a timely manner. It's a consensus across my team. Most employees are laser focused on their own career progression which can mean there is sometimes a competitive and non-cooperative vibe at times. The emphasis for career progression is on individual contributor work, which means the management focus is not quite there."

Has a really good internal recognition platform to celebrate successes but also has a fail fast culture which means they celebrate trying something new and working out quickly that it is the wrong thing to do.
A decent reward package with shared ownership being big part of Skyscanner's success.

Really orientated to deliver for the traveler and looks for employees that have a passion for travel.
Really passionate about diversity in the workplace with various working groups driving constant improvements.",Being in travel during covid had been hit by resourcing levels due to leavers.

The move to hybrid working will be a positive one in my opinion (though some may disagree with me on this)… and it seems senior leadership have listened and are making efforts to make sure the culture of the company is still a major draw card for the current and any prospective employees.

Recent announcements have also seen some benefits that were put on hold due to the recovery mode we entered (a result of the pandemic) reinstated - and that’s certainly lifted spirits as well. I feel hopeful about the company’s future once again.",Compensation reviews can’t come soon enough - (and we’ve been told they are).

- Great positive and proactive attitude by Office Managers. Most people still like to spend half the week at home, but the time in the office is good because of the people who put the effort in to make it so","- Too many pieces of work in progress at one time leads to slower overall progress

- Discriminatory feedback involving mental health issues. This was raised to the people team leadership, but I've seen no outcome from it.

Nice offices at the price of generally low income","1) Very high attrition, which means there is so much knowledge lost.
2) Salaries are lacking behind the market, which is the main reason for the high attention. Still, Skyscanner is paying so much money on renting its offices, this doesn't make sense, why would a tech/travel company rent in best locations with very high bills when it cannot afford to raise salaries to keep up with inflation? 
3) Promotion process is chaotic, to say the least.
4) Forcing people back to office, when they know for a fact that the work can be done remotely (looks like senior management use pre-covid mindset)."
