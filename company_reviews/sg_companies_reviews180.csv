-Enough other great people working there (all of whom are unfortunately being taken advantage of) that you could meet some good friends
-Free food sometimes","This company is the biggest bait-and-switch I have ever seen in Corporate America, and I have seen a lot. 

First they'll recruit you promising the world. Great culture, career opportunities, etc. Their initial pay offering will be below market and they'll justify it as a big company that keeps certain strict pay bands. They'll draw you away from a well paying, stable, comfortable job by promising you the world. 

You will learn fairly quickly that it is almost impossible to get a decent raise, even just enough to keep up with inflation. Even if you are a good employee meeting all expectations, they use ""forced curve"" annual reviews. So even if you have no performance problems and no actionable feedback, if there are enough ""higher performers"" in your department, no raise. The ""higher performers"" will often have more to do with what type of work is available and/or office politics than anything within your control.

This point will vary by department, but EXTREME disorganization. People being hired to report to one manager and then being switched around to report to another. This is not uncommon. There are many incompetent people working here at all levels and not much accountability for you having to do their job for them.

They may (and will!) promise you that the mass layoffs they are doing will not affect your department, right up until the day that you get a call from HR saying your department was slashed by layoffs by 50%. People will be laid off despite zero performance issues. No job stability.

From what I have observed, they did at least 5 rounds of sneaky layoffs, which they did in rounds stealthily so as to try to avoid mass panic and regulatory requirements. All this while touting how wonderful their latest acquisition (that caused the layoffs) will be for the company and its employees. 

After they lay off almost half of your department, they are also surprised when some people panic and quit, your department can't function, and deadlines are missed. So they go into full panic mode re-hiring for the well-performing employees they laid off/lost. Constant cycle of corporate over-hiring, over-layoffs, overcorrection. Absolute waste of good talent, and the most astounding lack of self-awareness by HR and the people making these decisions. 

Finally: absolute bureaucracy at all levels. Be prepared for every minor aspect of your job to take 5 times as long as it needs to, because of the layers of bureaucracy that persist in many departments. HR and IT are especially incompetent, but it is a company-wide problem. This company is bloated, probably beyond repair (and the layoffs don't seem to hit the departments that everyone knows are functionally useless - odd.)

Advice to applicants: don't be fooled, they are the epitome of everything that is wrong with Corporate America, while they put a pleasant face and pay lip service to caring about employees, but only care about the bottom line and will treat you as poorly as is convenient. If the pay and benefits and work experience are worth it to you, take the paycheck, line item on the resume, and run without looking back as soon as you get a better opportunity."

If I could no stars, I would.","Be prepared for a lack of clear direction and inconsistent leadership. The decision-making process appears to be driven more by budget constraints than by a genuine understanding of the market or customer needs - this spans across the internal operations and the technology too. The company is known in the market as ""the place that software goes to die"" for a reason and why the business has historically survived on auditing customers.

One of the major cons is the disconnect between the company's stated values, such as ""Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion"" and the actual work environment. Despite the rhetoric, there's a noticeable lack of diversity in leadership, promotions are based more on personal connections than merit - and this is even less likely if you fall under the category of any traditionally marginalised demographic in the field of Information Technology.

The management, predominantly composed of older individuals, seems resistant to change and innovation. Decisions feel outdated and out of touch with the fast-paced nature of the industry. This makes it challenging for teams to adapt to evolving market trends and meet customer expectations effectively.

Furthermore, the work culture can be toxic, with a pervasive sense of mistrust and lack of transparency. It's as if the leadership is more focused on cost-cutting measures than fostering a healthy and collaborative workplace.

Beware of the graduate programme; it lacks clear direction and valuable suggestions from seasoned professionals seemed to go unnoticed. The teams were guided by peer-to-peer engagement from individuals with minimal experience, akin to the blind leading the blind. Progression within the programme appeared driven solely by cost-cutting motives, as experienced colleagues were let go and replaced by newly ""qualified"" grads with substantially lower salaries. Consider this before committing to a path that might lack the mentorship and strategic guidance needed for a successful career.

In summary, if you value a dynamic, inclusive, and forward-thinking work environment, OpenText may not be the ideal place for you. The organisation seems stuck in outdated practices and fails to deliver on its promises of a diverse and inclusive workplace. Consider other opportunities where you can thrive without being hindered by the limitations of a company out of touch with the reality of today's business landscape."

You have to jump through hoops and connect with teams to get the deal across the line. Even if you have a PO you still have challenges closing a deal. The partner team is awful. There are not many partners available for security in the traditional sense. They have to go through a distributor and they are difficult to work with. The products are terribly aged and not great.

But I got this job after graduating college and it takes years to move up into a different position in the company because I still don't have technical experience so it keeps you in a cycle of being broke it could take about 4 years to get closer to a position you actually want to be in while doing double work of studying on the side what you really want to do.
