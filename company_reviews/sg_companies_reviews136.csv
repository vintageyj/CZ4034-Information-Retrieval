- Work is fulfilling and engaging
- You get to work with talented and intelligent engineers
- Flexible work schedule
- Unlimited PTO","The identified drawbacks primarily revolve around compensation and the motivation of engineers within the company:
- The process for receiving raises and promotions appears to be slower compared to industry standards, causing frustration among employees.
- The current compensation is on the lower side when benchmarked against competitors, potentially impacting employee satisfaction and retention.
- Overtime pay is not granted unless upper management approves, which may affect employees' morale who contribute additional hours to meet project demands.
- The monthly release cycles, while essential for project timelines, can contribute to a hectic work environment, particularly when managing dependencies with external teams. We're still not ready for this type of release cycle for some of our offerings."

That means meetings at 7am 9:30pm in the same day. - Strategy churn: It's healthy and expected in a high-tech market to turn on a dime and change projects and strategies to align with the market. Unfortunately, at Teradata those changes are so frequent and short-lived that it becomes a frustrating level of churn. - Poor communication from the executive level down and from individual contributors back up to management. - I thought we had gotten past the culture where it's not safe to respectfully disagree with executives, but unfortunately we have not. - Teradata trains its employees to not discriminate and then sets targets for hiring women and specific minorities (i.e., reverse discrimation)."

The benefits here are average and pretty standard - medical, dental, vision, life insurance, ad&d insurance. Obviously the premiums are coming out of your paycheck.","They have layoffs every year without fail. On the flip side, they don't really do anything innovative here. They have a parallel processing database that was very successful for decades before the cloud - they have name recognition in the enterprise. They have mediocre cloud offerings now. The real problem is that they don't have enough smart people working there, and more importantly, the duds have been elevated to high positions. Eventually, they let go of their CEO every few years, because this place has been a cesspool of bad people and bad ideas. They willfully ignore customer pain by routinely using patchwork and duct tape. The codebases reflect that. If you're a new grad that entered into this company, know that almost everything you see there is the wrong way of getting things done. The only reason customers even tolerate their offerings is either because they have legacy IBM mainframe applications that they still use, and they need to be on Teradata. You would think that technology companies make money by selling their technology. You would be wrong. This company makes money by building solutions that hard to manage and operate. They make the bulk of their money by contracting their employees on site with their enterprise customers to manage and operate their technology solutions. So much for a cloud offering. You would think that a company that is in this situation would pause and actually rethink their cloud strategy. They did, and nothing changed. Of course, they wanted everything to be done ""quickly"". They still make money by contracting people with their customers. Their main competitor is Snowflake. Imagine if you needed to hire someone to operate Snowflake. Teradata also routinely lays off these contractors. They have done it so many times at this point that I have personally met so many of these people who have successfully moved their employer away from Teradata. This company is a slowly sinking ship because no matter what the management attempts, nothing changes. Management gets frustrated, and lay off a bunch of people when things don't work. Eventually, Management failure is too visible, and they are let go. And so spins this wheel of misfortune. They stock has gone nowhere in years even before the pandemic. The upward movement in the stock is always market driven than anything to do with the company."

Teradata,4.0,"Feb 15, 2023","Solid Technology, slow GTM",Engagement Director,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"Worked for Teradata for three years. In that time, I came to learn that the company has GREAT technology to solve customer needs and challenges.","I was part of the consulting organization. It was difficult to sell services, and there was not a broad partner ecosystem available. During my 3 year tenure, there were lots of layoffs (almost annually), and lots of executive turnover."
Teradata,3.0,"Jan 16, 2023","Great people, impactful technology but years of transformation strategy have taken a toll",Customer Success Manager (CSM),"Former Employee, more than 10 years",,"The people. I have worked with incredibly talented people who are driven, innovative, action oriented, ethical, and wonderful to work with. The technology has many advantages and has features that are often not used efficiently or that get managed away in larger organizations making the tech look brittle and inflexible. It's not - you can throw bad code at big data using the platform but a mild amount of design does go a long way. Teradata has been around for more than a minute and tends to adopt some of the newer, more innovative ideas of other vendors in a moderately measured way. ""It just works"" is a key phrase I've often heard from customers even at times when they were tightening costs on the platform.","The biggest constant is change and no company stands still. It's a good thing in aggregate but I feel like in transforming Teradata has lost some of its identity. The company has made calls in staff reductions, resource allocations, engineering investments, and other areas that I don't think work for the company as it exists now in the real world with its real customers. I hope the pursuit of vision and growth continues, but with an appreciation of the role of what WAS and IS guiding it."
