Darktrace,3.0,"Feb 13, 2024","Cool Tech, No Pay",Account Executive,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Atlanta, GA","Technology is industry leading, going full platform so a number of tools to sell.","No ramp period. You are expected to deal with potentially 6+ months of no commission.
Hyper Aggressive, unrealistic sales approach with expected sales cycles in the 45 day range at large, enterprise and strategic customers. 
Mandatory 3 days in office (Tues/Weds/Thurs) no exceptions.
No stability, constantly changing teams and structures
No marketing help, with very little support in terms of outreach or information. 
Expected outreach as an AE is 150+ calls per week to the point that your prospects are DNC'ing you weekly due to the aggressive nature of the outreach.
Sales tracking is monthly, not quarterly, and 2 months of ""down"" will lead to a PIP in month 3. 
Less than a year in, and with the lack of ramp, total commission has been less than $6K."
Darktrace,4.0,"Sep 23, 2023",Its what you make it,Sales,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"The only cyber company that will hire you with 1-2 yrs sales experience. You'll go far if you show up every day and work without complaining. Company is ever-changing. 10 years from nothing to multi-billion valuation. Of course there are growing pains. This has been a direct sales model for 10 years so we've had to throw heads at the problem without the proper distribution in the channel like more mature cyber/IT companies. People complaining about the lack of experience across the board have never worked at a high-growth startup. We're just starting to mature now. New C levels, more focus on the channel. In the medium term there will be less and less salespeople here as we build distribution elsewhere. If you have the opportunity to sell here, use it to springboard your career. No it won't be easy, but you won't find an easy sales job in your mid-twenties in any industry worth being in. The CRM isn't that bad, its just easy to complain about. You get used to it. All of the terrible reviews you see here will likely be obsolete in the next couple of years. The structure of everything is changing. One thing that remains constant - the technology itself. It's superb.","Work at enough orgs you realize they're all messy and far from perfect. Darktrace included. But this is just reality, especially in a hyper-growth industry. Sometimes speed is the most important thing. Long term, things will stabilize internally at DT and it will become a blue-chip cyber company."

This bandwidth constraint is felt from Director all the way to the C-Suite...Too many reps on each team average is around 10 - 15 reps per team. -Barley any sales automation tools and zero cross functional work with Marketing, each department works pretty much silohed from each other - Inside Sales team mostly hammers accounts with calls, not a lot of strategic outreach which has led to aggravated prospects and negative perception in the marketplace"
Darktrace,2.0,"Dec 5, 2023",Wage Cage,BDE - Business Development Executive,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,The people you work along side will probably become life long friends due to the constant trauma you both endured.,"Not sure if it’s possible to fit all the cons in one box. I do want to note that managers and directors for the most part are good people. The company in general however is a terrible place for your mental health. The answer to everything is more dials. In turn you call prospects 3 times a weeks and quickly get blocked. Changes are made with good intentions and then carried out in the worst way possible (thanks sales ops) which resulted 20 people getting fired or just leaving over a 4 month span. There is no clear success plan month to month, what you do one month might put you at 150% and the very next month at 25%. BDEs lucky enough to get paired with good AEs will never have to worry about truly being good at this job and in turn will get supplemented with more opportunities, promotions, and able to get away with more while 60-75% of the office misses target for the 3rd month in a row."

2. Belittles employees instead of encouraging them
3. Employees that fall behind are micromanaged and criticized and don’t receive constructive criticism. They are threatened and made to feel worthless to the company.
4. Leadership discourages cutting corners but the top earners constantly cut corners and are positively acknowledged for getting meetings through that method.
5. If you are to put in your two weeks you must leave day of so you aren’t paid out your two weeks.
6. Technical tools do not sync so you don’t have a streamlined approach of calling but have expectations of calling 70-100+ numbers per day.
7. With that, there’s no actual sales strategy. You’re just pushed to call call call. With management not giving you the time to properly research and learn about the company outside of just calling. Once you’re an AE you MUST have a strategy but as an entry level BDR you’re just a call mule to burden potential customers.
8. Good AEs will help you learn great sales strategy but leadership just leaves you high and dry.
9. After days/months of putting effort into accounts you can just lose your AE thus losing your account and have to start from scratch with a new account or just fend for yourself with what you have left (if that’s anything)

Darktrace,2.0,"Jan 22, 2024","Tough Role, but real opportunity",Accelerator Account Executive,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Washington, DC","-Darktrace has such a reputation for churning and burning sales employees that a short tenure isn't a big impediment to finding a new job if you have the right recruiter, and can even be a selling point for you
-Product is good, as far as I can tell
-Commission is legitimately great if you can close deals
-When my manager had the time, he provided me with insightful and actionable advice on how to improve

-If any reps are looking at this review while considering an offer or interview I'd encourage them to read the cons with this in mind: while all of the below is true - IT DOES NOT PRECLUDE SUCCESS. There are many reps, even on the accelerator team, who have a tremendous amount of success at Darktrace and the commission is strong enough that this leads to some really large paychecks. 

You will need to be very disciplined, very organized, and (don't underrate this) smart enough to grasp the product, competitive market-place, and how to effectively position the value. I'd recommend that you be brutally honest with yourself about your ability, motivation, and work ethic, because I'd say that a majority of people are not capable of being successful in this role as it is currently structured.","-Incredibly saturated market and while the product is good, what value add it has over competitors is remarkably difficult to demonstrate over the course of the sale without a lot of luck - this leads to very sales-technique focused approach that some would consider a bit slimy or shady. I think that's an overstatement but you do need to buy in fully to that to be successful

-Truly mismanaged training. Misguided in terms of content, delivery, and specificity (why are AEs, Sales Engineers and CSMs all on the same trainings?) Very little focus on the sales process which between the focus on POVs (proof of value - trials basically) and the (truly) archaic CRM actually necessitates a lot of training

-They're flexible in remote work but do not do a good job of fostering any sense of unity or culture for those remote teams - can be very mentally taxing with the activity levels you are expected to hit

-lack of transparency regarding inbound leads for accelerator team - clearly they receive them but seemingly they are doled out completely to the director or VP's discretion. Understandable to a point but when new reps are making 80+ calls a day and fighting to build pipe it can be discouraging to see that the more tenured rep who makes 5 calls a week (not exaggerating) has twice as many meetings booked 

-Mentioned already but the CRM is absolute nightmare and makes it near impossible to efficiently prospect, get information that you need, and effectively manage the sales process
 (NOTE: in fairness I think this will be fixed in the 2024 calendar year)

-tied into the above, the communication between sales functions follows a poorly designed structure which often leads to reps being assigned to calls that they don't have availability for (which should be the primary variable)

-There's somewhat of a disconnect between middle management and leadership on the accelerator team - the new VP was an outside hire who never sold darktrace while all the directors started as reps (and had success). This has led to a strange dynamic. The VP doesn't seem to know a ton about the product but is otherwise personable and intelligent (other reps would disagree with me but that's my opinion) - but is widely disliked by many reps who were around before he got there. This is in part due to the team being significantly reduced over the last year, largely through PIPs/terminations due to performance. From my viewpoint, it does seem like there were a lot of under-performers who were just free riders in the system prior to the new VP joining but I was not there. This has led to significant morale problems, which were already present given the workload. I wouldn't say that the middle managers outright dislike the VP but I do think there are contrasting preferences between them in their vision of how the team should operate

-the workload is very high. You need a significant amount of prospecting activity in order to generate a viable pipeline without inbound leads (which you won't get unless a director takes a shine to you) and darktrace's (earned or not) reputation for manipulative sales tactics doesn't do you any favors. On top of this there are no assigned territories and accounts can be taken from you by other reps very shortly after you get them. this adds another huge mental component to your workload as you also have to stay on top of what accounts are in your name (of often 200+) as well as all deals. 

-The company has essentially decided that spending marketing dollars on the SMB segment is not economically viable and thus just throws inexperienced sales reps at it and sees if they sink or swim. That may seem fair to you, but you should what you're getting into

-Unclear communication of expectations during ramping period and very little training on what to do to be successful off the bat

-Almost zero training on selling through the channel, which is crazy given where the rest of cyber is in that regard,DT's long term goals for selling that way, and the fact that is probably the most reliably consistent method of generating pipeline

-Middle management had limited availability due to often being on other reps calls as back up."
Darktrace,1.0,"Sep 1, 2023",Rolling with The Punches,Enterprise Account Executive,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","San Francisco, CA",The longer you last the more your resume becomes a hot commodity on LinkedIn,"Entire organization restructured, and they changed the entire way the sales team operates. The veteran reps are scraping by while the junior reps are threatened daily and walk around scared of everyone. Everyone is scared of losing their job month to month. No joy. Nothing but vaping losers everywhere. 1 or 2 reps get fed all the inbounds and bring in 800% quota while 50 other reps are lucky to get 1 deal every 6-9 months. They only pay you half of 5% on TCV which now they just completely changed to ACV so will be a 3rd of total contract value. A third of all that gets taxed so you end up making a fraction of the total commission they try to promise you when you start. It's a 12 hour grind to maintain any type of healthy pipeline that if you even stop for more than 2 days you'll lose a grip of and feel underwater for the next month until your numbers reset again. All you are is a number until somehow you are handed a good lead from someone else."

Darktrace,2.0,"Sep 14, 2023","Might as well be called ""PIPs Ahoy""",Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"Many of the employees are very cool, intelligent, and passionate people. Even from a remote setting, it's very easy to befriend coworkers. Occasionally the company will fly everyone or specific teams to different parts of the country to conference and/or celebrate together. This is also a great place to start a career in cybersecurity and learn the industry. The product is great and unique on the market. Benefits are solid, completely paid for by the company.","Seems like leadership takes a 'hire then fire' approach and brings on many sales reps at a time, then fires half of them 6-12 months later. If you have a few bad months, expect a PIP then an exit. There's also a lot of persistent operational barriers to being successful (terrible in-house CRM, reps hoarding accounts) that make this job way more frustrating than it needs to be. It's almost a requirement to work 2-4 extra hours each day if you want to hit targets, and very few reps are even coming close to the marketed OTE. Also it's worth mentioning they've made major cutbacks on company events, meaning culture is declining fast."

Darktrace,3.0,"Jun 7, 2023",I have a lot to say,Enterprise Account Executive,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",,"Good product, you will work alongside people your age, pay is decent for lack of experience","Buckle up. You are trained and onboarded by people who couldn't cut it on the sales team so they moved to development. The management changes every 3 -6 months because senior leaders get so burnt out and harassed by management that they quit. Your success criteria (KPIs, Sales metrics, expectations) change at the drop of a hat so that your director will look better internally. This company values a few ""top performers"" who they will help out no matter who they screw over in the process. You are constantly under extreme pressure to perform, but the performance expectations change too frequently to ever get in a consistent rhythm. Instead of building a team and helping newer people succeed, the business will put you on a performance plan so that they can hire someone new instead of trying to develop their young salespeople. Out of ~60 people that started with me in August, 3 of the salespeople have stayed at Darktrace 9 months in."

EPIC gossip because of the toxic culture.,"The job is not Customer Success, it is used car salesman/ assistant AE/ con artist. Your clients will call you asking for help and your only job is to tell them the product works great and they should buy more products. Also, prepare for 10+ internal meetings a week for ultimate micromanaging and time wasting. I left a great job because of the potential commissions I would make but they gave me a fraction of the accounts I was supposed to have but didn't change the metrics so it was impossible to hit the numbers. I was told I would have around 40 accounts. After 8 months the most I had was 15. The KPIs were for 40 accounts still so we made zero commission. One guy on my team spent months on an upsell and his commission was $6 which they only pay you half of it when you close the deal and have to wait a year for the other half."

You can go to Darktrace for ~12 months and then leave to another cyber company to 1.5x-2x your base salary. So in one year you can make a base anywhere between 100k-130k as an enterprise AE somewhere else. You can skip multiple steps in your career by going here. No need to be an SDR or SMB rep. You can join as an enterprise rep right out of college or 1-3 years out. Many true enterprise reps have 5-10 years experience so when you leave you can command a salary that is way above your experience level. Some great, young people","The negative reviews you’ve read are spot on Base pay is under market Micromanagement is out of control: 2-3 internal meetings per day with your Director team (10-12 people usually). There are literally meetings on the calendar just to make sure people are working when remote. On the morning meeting everyone sets their goals for the day and on the EOD meeting everyone says if they hit their goals. This structure gets incredibly monotonous and the meetings are there just so management can feel like they are keeping track of everyone. Apart from the daily meetings, there are also 3-4 forecast calls a week and because the CRM is horrible, you waste time updating your directors and VPs about logistical info rather than talking deal strategy. Also depending on the Director these forecast calls can be used by management to publicly shame you in front of your peers for not hitting your numbers. I’m talking yelling and threatening your job in front of others. It feels like an elementary school teacher yelling at a student that is acting out. Darktrace has a horrible and high pressure sales culture. Because everything is measured monthly there is such a focus on short term results which leads management to pressure AEs by threatening their employment which leads to AEs pressuring their prospects/accounts for next steps. Because of this, Darktrace has a bad reputation in the market for being overly aggressive with prospects. Darktrace is good in that it gives young people the opportunity early in their career, but the flip side is that EVERYONE is under qualified for their current position. Because of this, management lacks experience and results to high pressure tactics to get results rather than actually developing their team by coaching. Most directors don’t know how to coach their reps. They don’t have the time or frameworks in place to get the most out of the reps. The directors are so time constrained that they only focus on active deals so new hires suffer and either sink or swim. Best advice for new reps, is to make friends with a good AE / team lead and get them to guide you and help you on calls because it’s rare to get that support from your director. If you are on the fence about joining Darktrace, I would think about it like this: If any of the following are true, then join: - you cannot get an AE role elsewhere for a higher base - you really want to get into cyber but can’t find an AE role elsewhere - you’re early in your career (just graduated or first or second job out of school) That said, if you do decide to join just know there will be a lot of stress that many can’t handle. It’s not a knock on you if you fall into that category but just know it going in. Everyone at Darktrace hits their breaking point at some point in their journey. AEs, team leads, directors, VPs, etc. There are stories/rumors that even VPs have had breakdowns of how much pressure upper management gives them. So it’s really a battle to decide to leave and get a higher base somewhere else or stay for the opportunity to close your current deals or look at a promotion. If you’re currently at Darktrace and don’t have a large pipeline and don’t see a promotion path I would suggest to look for a new job immediately. Overall I’m glad I joined Darktrace for where it got me, but I wouldn’t suggest it for those that can’t handle extreme pressure."

In the Chicago office, specifically, 18/30 reps are new hires within the past 4 months. Let that sink in... more than half of their reps haven't been there longer than 6 months. Reason being? High turnover, no job stability, lies during interview process, unfair territories, no structure, inexperience management, etc. Overall, majority of new reps hired have been extremely disappointed with their experience so far. Word of advice: don't trust a word recruiters say during interviews. They will lie about the role to attract top talent. If I knew anyone was interviewing here I'd tell them to go anywhere else."

People keep leaving and there is overall low sales quota attainment. - I'm not quite sure what sales ops/enablement does because the way that the sales systems are set up, makes it even harder to prospect (on top of how difficult prospecting is). The prospect workflow is inefficient, the crm + prospecting platform do not speak to each other the way it should. Other company's sales systems are set up more efficiently. It just seems like a system we're stuck with... consider ripping it out. I don't want to blame the systems, but the way they are set up hinder sales prospecting which hinders revenue.

Toxic, toxic work culture rife with gossip. Every ""manager"" micromanages your day to day with endless meetings, listening to all of your phone conversations, and day to day activities. They do this to ultimately enable them to micromanage you out of your job. They are not there to critique you or constructively build you up in your position. They are there to threaten and berate you until you either quit or placed on a performance improvement plan. The average tenure is <6mos or even less, why? People leave jobs because of bad management. The directors, are junior without any real management experience, and everyone on the salesfloor is either new or on their way out. The tech stack, subpar and non effective. Let's discuss pay. If you think you're going to collect a commission check, forget about it, 90% of all reps don't hit quota, and if you think you'll float along surviving on your base salary alone, they'll make sure your managed out with unrealistic high quotas before hand. Closed a deal? Wait a year to collect commissions, if you're luckily still there, most aren't. Think of having a handful of accounts and you're constantly justifying productivity day to day and calling your customers back to back? This place is the epitome of fake productivity and fake work until you have just enough experience on your resume to escape the madness. If you're looking for experience, avoid this place, there are better healthier companies that strive to make you better, not tear you down and throw you out the door like trash and move on the next victim. If you're experienced, think twice. I've seen countless experienced reps leave once they experience the dissary, unprofessional management, and lack of communication. You can do 10x better just about anywhere better than this place. The ""higher"" base salary doesn't justify itself if most are gone before year 1, let that sink in."
Darktrace,1.0,"Sep 14, 2023",Darktrace Company Review as Previous Employee,Enterprise Account Executive,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","New York, NY","Commission Opportunities: Employees have the potential to build their book of business and earn commission, potentially adding a few thousands of dollars to their base salary. Decent Base Salary: A $75,000 base salary is provided, which can be a reasonable starting point for some individuals. Office : The company has a nice office in a nice location.","Poor Management: Many employees express dissatisfaction with the management team, from directors to VPs of sales. They report a lack of support, micro-management, and disappointment in results all around. No Internal Help : VPP does not help to make a standpoint to the employees and can not effectively help individuals feel heard to any capacity. Unrealistic Metrics: Some employees find that the performance metrics set by the company are difficult to achieve, possibly due to negative press, lack of accounts or other factors beyond their control. Limited Opportunities for Account Executives: Some account executives feel that they are not provided with enough opportunities to succeed, and the support from sales development representatives (SDRs) in booking meetings is lacking. Decent accounts only go to previous AE's who originally started with the company many years ago. Biased : Every employee is treated differently. Someone can work remotely in a different country for 1+ months whereas the other team member has to take PTO because they are feeling unwell and would like to work remote for 1-2 days. No standards. High Turnover Rate: Darktrace has a high turnover rate, with the average tenure being less than one year. This may indicate a lack of stability in the workplace. Cut-Throat Culture: The work environment is described as cut-throat, with frequent terminations and little room for true success or job security. Layoffs weekly. Lack of Positive Culture: Employees report a lack of positive culture, with no team outings or positive energy in the office. The company is seen as promoting disappointment rather than fostering a supportive atmosphere. Abrupt Termination: Some employees claim they were terminated abruptly, even when on the verge of closing significant deals, suggesting limited job security. Stressful Environment: This position and company plays a huge role to your mental health in a negative way. Negative Press : Look up ""Darktrace Negative Press"" and you will find all the information that has been currently going on with the financial standpoint of the company. No Diversity & Lack of women working at the company. Overall, Darktrace offers little potential for financial gain through commissions but a reasonable base salary. Their is a large # of issues related to management, culture, biased hire-ups and little job stability that may make it a challenging place to work for some individuals seeking a stable and supportive work environment."

Cool product but unfortunately that doesn't outweigh this nightmare of a company.,"Where to even begin... accepting a job with Darktrace was the biggest mistake I have made in my professional career. They lie about the job responsibilities in the interview process to attract talent, but don't get too comfortable because they will fire you as soon as they hire you! Truly there are springs in every AEs seat. Management constantly changing & also weekly threats coming from the top about performance. Never any positive feedback or support from leadership - all they care about are numbers but hardly anyone hits their number so it's constant berating and threatening people's jobs on every weekly town hall. Really great motivation tactics!!!! Unrealistic metric expectations and insane micromanagement (they will listen in to your phone calls without you knowing and also check your activity throughout the day based on a ""heat map"" and question you if there are gaps of time where your heat map doesn't show activity). Way too many AEs in each region which leads to constant crossover on accounts and terrible feedback from prospects because every contact has been called minimum 20 times by different AEs. Horrible CRM that is a wannabe attempt at being Salesforce, but is extremely inefficient, always down, and leads to more disorganization. They only hire talent under the age of 35 and say anyone older wouldn't fit into the ""culture of Darktrace"". Best of luck if you want any support on deals or enablement because most of the directors don't even know the product. It's considered ""weird"" if you are with the company over 1 year, my entire office had all been there less than a year. They say they are a ""stepping stone"" in your career, and never once emphasized growth within the company. I made the mistake of ignoring these reviews when I accepted my offer so I want to help others make sure they don't make the same mistake as me. DON'T DO IT!!!!"
