Qualtrics,2.0,"Feb 5, 2024",Qualtrics USED to be Great,Account Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"This review is tough to write. If you asked me over 2 years ago I would have written a 5 star review. Majority of people that work at Qualtrics are incredible. I met some of the greatest people at my time at Qualtrics. I also had a fantastic experience with my managers, incredibly supportive and overall I loved the work that I was doing. The money was also good if you work hard and hit your numbers.","It is funny because Qualtrics is an experience management company and claims to be so transparent, however they DO NOT practice what they preach. The C-Suite and upper management does not care about the people that work under them. As long as they are putting more money in their pockets they do not care that they are eliminating hundreds of jobs. 2 huge layoffs in one year with more to come. Zig reads off a script to tell hundreds of people that they don't have a job anymore. They do not listen to their employees. You can be a top performer and still not have job security. If you have an LDS manager and you are not LDS, your LDS teammates will get favored (this happens frequently). Being acquired by PE only benefitted upper management and everyone knows it. Don't work here if you value job security."
Qualtrics,3.0,"Dec 28, 2023",High caliber ‘24 company with bottlenecking ‘04 processes,Customer Success,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Provo, UT","TLDR: unique perks ideal for dog owners and families, good logo for a resume, caring middle management, willing to change. 

Experience bonus, dog friendly, top-tier subsidized onsite daycare ages 3 mos to <5 years, locations all over, catered lunch everyday, gorgeous office spaces, above average work life and supporting families, willing to pivot to stay growing, competitive pay, quality mid-level managers, and unique programs for higher achievers","TLDR: Sr leaders deflect instead of owning blame and doing something about it. Employee development and customer experience are neglected/not prioritized. Laggers in most internal categories. Poster-child for talking instead of doing

Sr. Management frequently blames macroeconomic/extenuating circumstances for poor performance, lack of support for employees-middle mgmt, and ever-harshening/moving metrics and targets. All of which result in rapid burnout, directionless trajectories for careers and department, and the programs to enable personal & professional advancement are mediocre and not prioritized. 

Benefits are top notch but fall behind in the enterprise space and even other local tech companies.

OKRs are might help startups, but they more often then not create bottlenecks from incomplete programs and ideas, unnecessary additional layers that don’t communicate well, or even admin rights to dif systems that leave when people leave the company. 

Promotions/raises are unreasonably unattainable"
Qualtrics,2.0,"Feb 6, 2024","As wallets tighten, experience management has fallen by the wayside",Customer Success Specialist,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Provo, UT",Competitive starting salary. Some teams have strong work/life boundaries. Utah employees have access to a myriad of additional benefits through Qualtrics' partnerships with local companies.,"Employee experience management is all but non-existent internally at Qualtrics. Originating from the C-Suite, the company has developed a culture of hypocrisy that pretends to be a culture of empathy. In addition, Qualtrics has unfortunately followed the rest of the tech industry in mandating RTO, reducing fringe benefits, halting the internal promotion process, and conducting periodic mass layoffs to give boosts to EOQ metrics."

Different groups to get involved with and events held by the company","Recent changes to the company (being bought by SAP, going public, being bought by SilverLake, going private) have led to layoffs and restructuring. They're focusing more on offices outside of the US, in particular the Mexico City office in order to get cheaper labor.
If you're in the Provo office, there won't be much diversity."
Qualtrics,2.0,"Oct 17, 2023",Sinking ship,Software Engineer II,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Seattle, WA",Large company with some mature systems. Work life balance has been good; rarely work 40 hours a week. Low stress on-call. RTO currently unenforced. Engineering pay pegged at ~85th percentile by location. Good teammates and managers. Good diversity relative to similar companies.,"Qualtrics has been circling the drain for a while now. Private equity bought the company out this past summer and has been slowly gutting it. Big layoffs recently, many jobs moved to lower cost locations and other countries, no leadership accountability whatsoever. Total chaos followed. RTO enforcement coming. Pay cuts (or absence of refreshers) likely coming. Everyone good is looking to leave soon. Product is also incredibly boring to work on although I don't personally mind as long as working hours stay low. Not a single person in the C-suite deserves to be there. They are driving the company away from being a survey platform (which we excel at) to being a management suggestion tool (which we're bad at and customers don't need). They set on this path when the economy was good, and many customers were shelling out for a luxury product and making decisions based on employee and customer feedback. But now that the tech economy is bad, decision making is driven only by profit, making Qualtrics' experience management insights irrelevant. For example, Qualtrics can tell Delta that customers want extra leg room on flights. But Delta doesn't care, they need the money from those 3 extra rows. It is a rare case when Qualtrics can provide an insight that 1.) is novel and 2.) is actionable in a profitable way."

Pre-acquisition Qualtrics was a very supportive and great place to work generally,"- Leadership is totally out of touch and doesn't give a crap about lower level employees. - Instead of cutting the CEO's disgustingly high salary, they laid off 15% of the workforce with an additional 10% to come. - They preach diversity but couldn't care less. They cut their entire DEI team and the high level people at the company are primarily all white mormon men. Women and BIPOC people are grossly underrepresented. - They will not consider hiring people who do not have a 4-year college degree which is a really outdated and classist practice. - The general vibe especially in the Utah office is cult-like and oozes toxic bro culture. - Mormon culture seeps into company culture and is uncomfortable for non-LDS - The general strategy for where the product is going is a total mess and real innovation is extremely hard. It's more arguments than productivity. - Because of terrible leadership moral is at an all time low - Back in the day, I would've recommended working at Qualtrics to anyone.

Leadership firmly exhibits WIIFM rather than truly grasping an understanding of what drives their employees (which is ironic as Qualtrics is a company focussed on selling Employee and Customer Experience ""Solutions"").

Qualtrics,3.0,"Feb 9, 2024",Come back in a few years,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"Good Pay, Benefits, Co-Workers, Offices, Free Lunches","Qualtrics was a good company to work for but now its just a puppet company to a private equity firm. Ever since we got acquired by an private equity firm decisions have all been about money and leadership are just copying other companies playbooks in order to reach our goals rather than taking the risks and losing face or making improvements. Everyone looks at spreadsheets rather than people. Our goal is to go public but that usually means that it is all about looking good according to the numbers. This means that a lot of the good things about working here were cut since they didn't really cut our pay. High performing workers (layoffs, and silent resignations), promos(once a year and very few slots), and outsourcing (just for cheap labor and more money) just to name a few. If you are a bright eyed worker wanting to work for a company to do good in the world and work at a purposeful company I would stay away until we go public again. If you are a 9-5 guy just doing enough to get by but don't really care about the company vision by all means come join the fun."

In all reality, the people thought that they had just been there so long that they either had to believe it or they were simply in luxurious positions due to the length of their employment. That makes for an interesting experience when you've seen better workplaces.
- Sales, sales, sales. There was no real solutioning for prospects, and parts of the product that no enterprise would want to use because they have their own analytics and dashboards already were forced down people their throats because that is where the money is when you're just sending survey links
- Office attendance enforcement was stupid, even pre-covid let alone post-covid
- If you don't work out of one of the two (at the time) major office hubs you will truly see how stupid all the enforced branding and hype is
- Seen leadership make some really ridiculous comments in company-wide meetings
- Once everything connected and I was doing over 100% of my target (in a supportive role) not even half way into the fiscal year, people started being nice, but at that point I was fed up with the company, because it's all glimmer and smoke
- Everything was about the stock price. Nobody ever envisioned how the customers would really experience value, and with that how that would lead to growth and higher company valuation

Qualtrics,1.0,"Oct 13, 2023",Serious Sexism Problem,Customer Success,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"Fun offices, free food, cool coworkers","Despite all of the big bets about increasing gender equity, etc., Qualtrics is the most sexist company I ever worked for. Just some examples: 1. Look at the senior leadership team. Most of the time, very little representation of women at the highest levels, and when there is, it’s usually in people ops or training/enablement. 2. I know for a fact that at least one male coworker who had less experience than I did started at the same time at a notably higher salary than me or my other female counterparts. 3. At one point, I learned that no woman on my team had ever gone on maternity leave and been allowed to come back to her same book of business, and only one had even been enabled to come back to her same role. Nobody ever thought to create a coverage plan policy to help avoid this. 4. Managers actively discourage men from taking their fully allotted paid parental leave. 5. The ratings system and policies mean that women who go on maternity leave are set back as much as a year when it comes to promotion opportunities, even though they are often only gone for 12 weeks. Any equity in representation seems to devolve to tokenism and making numbers look good. I am sure that much of this inequity comes down to unconscious bias stemming from the LDS roots."

I met and worked with some of the most wonderful people at Qualtrics.","Leadership: Where to start. First, the leadership is an absolute abomination. Other than a couple with Microsoft experience, the rest are inexperienced outside of Qualtrics. They do NOT value diverse perspectives, and if you push back you are silenced. Diversity: All of the President level and all of their direct reports are men. The majority are white, Mormon men. Women have no seat at any table. And it's worse for people of color. Valuing the function of PMM: From the top leader on down, there is no understanding or value of the function of PMM. They think PMM makes slides and have reorged in a way that anybody with a heartbeat is put into PMM. Some of the people are brilliant in their own area whether that's Solution Strategy or Industry, but simply assigning someone ""you're now a PMM"" when they have no certifications from Pragmatic Marketing and no experience truly doing inbound and outbound PMM is just absurdity.

Industry - customer experience and employee experience are fundamentally positive concepts. You can feel good about the work you do because the ultimate goal is to make companies treat customers and employees better.","There have been an abnormally large number of negatives working for Qualtrics.

Toxic Positivity - a large majority of the company would prefer you act positive and enthusiastic all the time, even if there are problems to be solved. Bringing up problems gets you labeled as difficult to work with and can negatively impact your career progression. You also wind up getting ignored a lot.

Product Roadmap - the leadership and strategy for the product is severely lacking. For a technology company, it’s a bad sign when there isn’t a clear strategy and path forward. ChatGPT and other LLM-technologies also represent an existential threat that leadership doesn’t seem to acknowledge.

Arrogance - most middle management or senior level employees believe they are such experts in experience management that they often talk down to customers and coworkers. Even if you join from a competitor, they will make sure you understand that they are the experts and your previous experience does not count. This was not specific to one team; it is a characteristic broadly across most customer-facing roles. Customers often get frustrated by this arrogance because experience management theory doesn’t always align to the practical implementation that customers are experiencing.

Pay - excluding engineering and excluding Utah-based employees, the pay is average. Various benefits, including health benefits, are quantified and accounted for when talking about compensation, even if other companies only use your base salary and bonus by comparison. It is a disingenuous way to artificially inflate your compensation.

Resistant to Change - the company is constantly talking about the past. The hyper growth era for the company is over but most tenured employees refuse to adjust their mindset to the current state of the company. Tenured people get promoted into roles because they might be able to guide the company back to where it was 5+ years ago, when the reality is that new voices and skillsets are desperately needed. There are also a lot of people (~30%+) that have never worked for another company in their career."

Employee experience is the last thing on their minds, and it has continued to plummet with the recent acquisition by private equity, SilverLake.

4 day RTO and 2 weeks remote ""benefit,"" enforced if you're unlucky like me and get a bad manager

Comp is getting worse, and promo opportunities have severely decreased, now dependent on a ""business need"" rather than strictly merit/readiness.

WLB is heavily team-dependent, but my experience has ranged from okay to terrible, being asked to work on an occasional weekend or late nights.

Some terrible managers and politics with arbitrary deadlines being pushed onto employees from leaders and no way to push back."

They mandated return to office and gave most remote employees an ultimatum to relocate or get laid off on top of the most recent layoffs and other employees simply got told they would be let go in March next year. The relocation letters had no compensations other than being told you'd be reimbursed (no details on dollar amount). They did another round of layoffs even after we did one at the start of the year and they told everyone there wasn't going to be another one this year. There's no transparency and instead of even offering pay cuts or doing pay cuts across the board (including the CEO) they would rather just bleed valuable talent from every single team in the company. Most people I talked to don't see themselves sticking around long term (me included). Maybe if things get better."

For the most part, the work-life balance was manageable, as long as I wasn't working on X4 (Qualtrics' biggest event of the year).","Most of my cons come down to the quality of senior management. There was a lack of empowerment, trust and respect - despite hiring highly experienced people. People are asked to work on projects that were completely shut down or reprioritized once senior leaders got involved - including in efforts that leaders didn't need to be involved in. Lack of transparency, which led to a rampant, toxic rumor mill. Very office-centric culture; Qualtrics asks their employees to work from an office at least four days a week, and recently either let go of remote workers hired during the pandemic or is forcing people to move closer to an office."

I know some people from my level making 12k less than me for the same job function. - They took away one of two promotions cycles that happen each year, so now people have to wait a LOT longer to get promoted, if they even do. The process is long and painful as it is. - Most people who work at Q will tell you they have change fatigue - SLT has no clear path or direction, so they just make changes frequently (weekly at this point) to see what works and what doesn’t work. A week without some sort of change is all I ask for. - Processes make no sense and often result in angry customers because issues take so long to address - The platform breaks with one wrong move. - No career path for my team once you become L5, L6, etc. - Laid off most of the DEI team - how is this not important to this company?"
