IDC (International Data Corporation),2.0,"Sep 7, 2023",Not worth it,Senior Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Tampa, FL",Somewhat intellectually stimulating market to sell to if you enjoy tech and innovation. Coworkers were all cool for the most part. Brand is not very well respected but is known at least.,"Micro management. As a too performing sales person and presidents club winner I wasn’t rewarded with more autonomy, but rather expected to train other more junior incoming sales reps. All for helping out others but not when it isn’t appreciated. Line of business managers are very immature and strange. Mine in particular would get drunk at happy hours and start making weird inappropriate comments. Pay is not on par with industry. Other analyst firms have a better reputation. They also hired way too many sales people in tampa and then laid a bunch off."

Stable, friendly and also forward-thinking.",Research Manager,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","San Mateo, CA","IDC is a forward thinking company that plans itself well. The management sees what is ahead for the IT business intelligence market and makes strategic responses such as acquisitions. The company has remained pretty independent through ownership changes - a Chinese conglomerate at one point, then now under Blackstone. One doesn't feel any changes through these changes and it is good from management. There is frequent communication from the management to shed light on the business at large and they really welcome feedback. IDC has long practiced hybrid work, well before COVID. The employees respond in kind by mostly staying around for a long time. They also try to convey messages of inclusivity and integrity. We have numerous workshops to help with personal development.","Monetary compensation simply isn't on par with many other data jobs in the industry, be it at an IT vendor or elsewhere. The company is pretty tight about that. It is easy to rise from entry level, but afterwards the goal posts and timeline for further advancement are unclear, expectations can be better outlined.

Perception is the reality there due to all the silos, very few people have a view into what the individual business lines are doing so it makes it hard to coordinate across different teams, everyone protects their own fiefdom - this limits any sort of innovation on the product front
The key to success at IDC is having a good manager that can navigate the politics and will stick up for their team when needed. This might be hard to find given the lack of movement in the upper ranks. Those types of managers don't last long.

Decent amount of time off.,"- A lot of employees feel underpaid and unappreciated. Employee morale is horrible but management doesn't care. Recognition is focused on analysts and the rest of the staff is often ignored. No career path opportunities.
- Too much focus on cost cutting so resources are stretched too thin and demands are very high (even though the owner is making a ton of profit and management brags about it). Unrealistic sales goals and then more layoffs occur when they are not met. 
- No long term strategy. No investment in technology so most of the systems are antiquated and resources are wasted on dealing with the limitations. Little synergy between systems or operating units.

And you are able to use your knowledge in a variety of ways, whether it's through writing documents, creating forecasts, or working on a Tracker service.

On the personnel side, the benefits are ok -- not great, not terrible.  However, most managers/directors/VPs take IDC's work/life balance pretty seriously and support their staff in achieving and maintaining a good balance.

Managers/directors/VPs also usually take an interest in their employees' career paths, and do what they can to encourage them both to succeed at IDC and to achieve their personal career goals.","Salary isn't on par with the rest of the industry, so you do the same amount of work for less cash.

If you're a minority or a woman, don't expect to ever achieve upper echelon status here:  it's not going to happen.  

The majority of women working for IDC in its WW HQ are at lower level positions in research or in administrative and support roles.  Only in the marketing organization do women have parity with their male counterparts.

There used to be resources for marketing and business development but those have been cut and not replaced.  Analysts have too many hats to wear, but any time that this is pointed it, management blames it on nuisance individuals. There is a growing number of demoralized and disenfranchised people in recent months."

Being an industry analyst at a well know firm gives you a great deal of access and entry into the biggest technology companies at an executive level. Work is interesting and you can take your research agenda in any direction you want - as long as you can retain a sufficient customer base.,"Very poor vision and operations - horribly inefficient and pretty poor leadership.  Profitability model that charges extremely high rates to customers but squeezes P&Ls dry so it feels like you are always operating on a shoestring.  Most investment decisions (including approving Blackberries to individual analysts) were made by 2-3 senior executives making it extremely difficult to innovate on business models, processes, tools."

Tracker products are valued externally, but tracker employees are treated as replaceable cogs internally.  The consulting and advisory services aren't all that good, and customers are pushing back.  The sales force makes a lot of money, but adds little value.  Management probably knows some of this stuff, but doesn't really know how to react.  They do nothing to promote teamwork, offer no investment, and have no strategy for growth."

IDC (International Data Corporation),2.0,"May 4, 2015",Company's best days are behind it,Research Manager,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","Framingham, MA","- acceptable pay & benefits that skew towards the lower end of the range however you define it.
- flexible work arrangements
- colleagues are mostly congenial though company culture dictates a certain amount of competition which makes collaboration difficult.","There are many reasons not to consider IDC as a potential employer or a reason to leave it for that matter. Two general reasons come immediately to mind: 

1) reticence to change
2) increasingly outdated business model. 

There are too many specifics to cover in this field but if you'd like to step back into the research days of yesteryear, perhaps IDC is the place for you. Management laziness / ineptitude and the internal politics of the company means change of the smallest variety is the exception and painful at best.

As a result, IDC is a highly inefficient place where menial tasks are unnecessarily difficult because management refuses to acknowledge the opportunity costs and lost productivity that are the result of dated tools (expense reimbursement, information management) and processes. As one reviewer noted, poorly-designed organizational structure and processes does not equate to an entrepreneurial culture. It just means things take an unusually long time to get done.

Also, good luck with career advancement which is an opaque process at best. Career progression usually happens in one of three ways:

1) Backstabbing. Many that climb the IDC ladder, where rungs aren't always visible, have been known to do so by nefarious means. 
2) Attrition. Hang in there long enough and there's a good chance some exasperated soul in the lower to middle rungs of the company will run away screaming leaving an opening for some unfortunate soul.
3) Leave and come back. Strangely, this is a celebrated part of IDC's stale culture. It's not unusual for talented people to rightly leave the company and come back after management wakes up to the fact the person or people in question were undervalued. If they bit their lips during their initial / previous stint with the company, management sometimes employs them again albeit at a higher level. (great way to encourage the rank and file to stay the course by the way).

For a company that is purportedly global, IDC is embarrassingly U.S. and Framingham centric. To be fair, more attention is being paid by some in senior ranks to China and other higher growth markets (imagine!) as lower American growth has caught up to the company. 

IDC will exist so long as the brand is respected within the ranks of the old information technology vendor guard. But if IDC continues along its current path, employee attrition will rise and college students will learn about this once highly-respected company in 20 to 30 years time in the many great nearby business schools."

Employees typically like the benefits offered - and bonuses can be lucrative.,The company operates as a group of individuals moreso than as a company.
