You're not paid based on your qualifications. - Big push to apply for jobs you knowingly aren't qualified for. - No office space...in 3 years I never went to an office nor was I given any form of company id or badge. - Lots of live training offered, but most of it will be off-limits to you due to Coforge ""verticals"" structure. - Business units within Coforge seem to be in competition with each other instead of working together. - You will have nobody in management here to advocate for YOU. It's important that you realize you are on your own, nobody will give you any direction on training or career improvement or job placement.
