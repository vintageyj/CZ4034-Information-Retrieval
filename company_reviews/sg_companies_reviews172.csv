They guarantee 7 days of sick time per year with the ability for your manager (or short-term disability) to increase this number. We are also given 4 personal choice holidays, 8 paid holidays, and 15 vacation days. Depending on your role and manager, there is flexibility in your working hours that allow for you to ""flex"" time when necessary.","Pay is lower than market value and employees that stay with the company are not given adequate raises to keep up with cost of living, experience, or new hires. A lot of your experience is solely determined by the manager that you have. Some managers are great and some are absolutely terrible."

Some good people. They are working hard to provide more comprehensive services. Salaries can be good for some when they don't change the comp plan.","For some reason they did not protect themselves when the contracts novated over from IBM. So that when IBM raises their prices to Kyndryl, they try and pass it along to their customers even mid-contract with them. This causes a customer sat issue. Lots of sat issues. Not focusing on organic growth but only on the few profitable clients. Old time IBM management employees form a click and protect themselves at the cost of efficiency. There is a lot of people staying in roles where they should be shifted and moved around. Others are promoted prematurely based on old connections. Perhaps they will have a management RIF. Top leaders have exorbitant salaries while they rework the comp plan to focus on GP and reduce commissions to those who own the day to day relationships. ( see my comment above on why that is harsh - they artificially raise allocation on SOW's to increase cost of sales )"

I found upper management to be less than forthright which is expected but not only that they downright lied to hundreds of us for months before we were finally given a measly 2 weeks notice.

Customers forced to migrate to resell contracts against their will. Terrible support from overstretched collogues that are completely overwhelmed with work. No one knows what the prices of services are, pricing is a joke and takes weeks to get any numbers to customer because of triple/quadruple internal approval gates. Micromanagement to the extreme. You have to report a transcript of customer conversations to management daily. Every action you make has to be reported to management. Everyone faces unbelievable levels of scrutiny. This drives the culture into a cannibalistic frenzy where friends eat friends, and managers consume their own teammates. Delivery is horrendous, the worst delivery team I have every worked with.

Each violation gets you a negative point and after a few you get an interview with HR.. I mean - don't they run these things by legal? In a multinational corporations you try to do things like this to your workforce? Regarding Azure.. To even request anything in azure you first need to build a perfect architecture and get it approved through processes that change constantly. And even if you get all the approvals you don't get a subscription (like in every other enterprise this size) but you get only the specific resource you asked for with very limited access to it - everyone who has ever touched azure will know where this goes.. stuff that took me 2 weeks at previous companies now takes 6 months and I don't even know if my resources still work tomorrow because someone decided to change the rules again.. in 8 years working with Azure I never had serious downtime issues.. here it's a weekly thing - I don't even know how you can get downtime in azure..??? Regarding Office365.. They restrict connectors in Power Automate.. so for each flow or power app you create you need to go through an approval process.. you want to use MS forms to get some answers quickly? Nope, you need to work through an 8 week approval process first, get a dedicated environment for it and then you are allowed to use it.. I wouldn't be surprised if they restrict excel formulas next.. (well they probably would if they'd know how to..) It's very sad since the company has great potential but this ancient culture of ""we want to do it as we always did"" and ""our colleagues are our enemies"" is really not fun. Especially if you are used to a modern workplace where cloud is normal it just feels like the dark ages here.. (remember 2014 when you needed to use your VPN to connect to a super slow jump host you share with 100 other people so you can get access to a server? yeah.. )"

Kyndryl,3.0,"Apr 19, 2023",Many ups and downs,Offering Management,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"Very bright, committed colleagues across all of the orgs that I’ve had the opportunity to work with. Best part of the job. It can be both invigorating and grueling to be part of Kyndryl as it tries to move from startup to non-startup mode.",Work/life balance is not good. Terrible for some employees. Regularly work 12 hour days alongside my teammates. I’m in the US. The hours that my coworkers work in India are even worse. Archaic internal processes (legacy IBM processes and tools) although there is work underway to make improvements.

My team asked for a process improvement, one we had been denied by IBM and Kyndryl executed on it immediately, taking us from a 3 page process that took close to 30 days to execute to a 1 page process that executes is just 5 to 7 days.

The best female leadership diversity I have ever seen. Am very proud to see so many woman leaders - over and over. Our day one global launch party was led by one of our female executives and when we went live on the NYSE, the balcony was full of female faces.

Really appreciate all the time and effort that is spent on making training available for all employees.

There is an excellent system for making employee referrals. It lists all available career opportunities and offers bonus dollars for those making the referral.",Made a bad choice at the end of last year and didn't grant raises. They issued raises just a couple months later and I received the best raise I have had in years. Worked at IBM 2 years and AT&T for 20 plus years.
Kyndryl,3.0,"Feb 24, 2023",What's left when a great company leaves and a shell remains,Staff Analyst,Current Employee,,work hours are day shift work from home autonomy,"the ability to support my customer to the level they are accustomed to is now a vague memory of work past great IT tools to support my job have been replaced with hard to use, less effective tools management has been off shored and there is a culture divide that makes team work challenging incentives to perform better, raises, bonuses have been removed from the environment very high turnover rate at the entry level positions - all entry level positions are offshore now no clear company vision huge amount of new challenges added that reduce my ability to support our client"
