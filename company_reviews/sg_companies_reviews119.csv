Intuit,5.0,"Feb 18, 2024",Great Company to Work For,SM1,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,People friendly and supportive envirnment. Pockets of extraordinary team work. Stronger Together!,"No human organization is perfect, but this is a good one!"
Intuit,5.0,"Dec 14, 2023",Great Remote Work Opportunity - Fun Place to Work,Senior Associate Live Expert Bookkeeper,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Oakland, CA","Ability to work remotely, from 20 hours to 40 per week; that's terrific! Emphasis on individual learning, growth and career development. Work/life balance. Great benefits, including bonuses, health care benefit and 401 (k) plan matching (125% of contributions up to 6% of gross pay). Now 40 hours (1 week) of paid vacation per year. Some extra paid ""recharge days"" around the holidays. Freedom to build your own bookkeeping business on the side. Many of us do just that, and Intuit actually encourages it as long as you don't steal their Live Bookkeeping clients. That would of course be a conflict of interest. So I find this kind of job as a great opportunity to learn and become a QuickBooks Online Expert while building my own business on the side. Flexible schedule, but that requires Team Manager's approval.","Pay could be higher at the level of skill that they expect. But from what I understand there are raises and bonuses are supposed to be generous. No vacation used to be a con, but now select time employees at least get a week of paid vacation per year. And you can request unpaid time off during less busy periods."
Intuit,2.0,"Feb 5, 2024",What others won't tell you,Bookkeeper,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",,"Awesome benefits, consistent work, flexible schedules, tons of training & potential growth opportunities!","Don't get too comfortable with a certain group of people you work with, Intuit loves to change things and move teams around. 

I have been on multiple teams since starting less than a year ago.

Co-workers can be very clique, very juvenile.

Management is very micro managy, and people who should be door greeters for box stores are leads (assist Management). 

Very difficult to get support for unique situations. 

Favoritism for some employees by Management and bad behavior goes unpunished. 

Metrics those are more important than the people closing the books.

I love the work I do, but it is very stressful. Have to adapt to numerous situations and still close books. Since starting, I now have high blood pressure issues. If you like to work with the same people, and do not care for change then I would look elsewhere for employment."
Intuit,1.0,"Jan 16, 2024","Once know for Good WLB , currently one of the worst in Industry",Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"Good Perks and benefits. If not par, equivalent to whats Google and it peers offers. 
Do provide office cabs. 
Few teams are still exists, who have true WLB.","In last 2-3 years, Indian management has putting in so much pressure on managers and Engineers and expectation is to work 24*7. Seriously, I am not at all joking.
Recently, we had Q&A with Indian Leadership and upon asking about WLB, it was told this is what how we are going to operate and each one of you will see the rigor and have to cope up with the work style.
Too much legacy code and maintainance task specially in billing team(former named as MSE now called as GTM-Tech).
A engineer has to do every stuff and has to run from pillar to post to get things done and won't find much help from peers and everyone trying to hold up their position and not comfortable sharing knowledge with colleagues .
There are very few teams and their top managers who still priotise employee well-being at first place but those are very few in India.
Being a current employee- One recommendation DON'T EVER PLAN TO JOIN INTUIT BILLING (MSE/GTM Tech TEAM) Otherwise you will regret on your decision like many of us who have joined the same team."
Intuit,2.0,"Jan 3, 2024",Just another mediocre large company,Senior Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Eagle, ID","Good benefits. Great stock purchasing program. They are very good at talking a big game, but it feels like culture leftover from founder Scott Cook a long time ago, so now it feels like they're just going through the motions.","Pay is not great compared to peers. Promotion processes are convoluted. You need a director or above to sponsor your application. Extremely slow product development hampered by red tape and invisible gatekeepers. When they acquired the company I worked for, they threw tons of resources at switching our product to their One Intuit login. Last I heard, it's still in progress 3 years later. Their marketing is out of touch as well. They spent millions on a silly robot superbowl commercial while I worked there, it was awful. They also heavily lobbied congress for less tax filing rights for normal people (for their benefit). They committed to spend $500 million to put their name on an L.A. stadium while simultaneously firing hundreds of critical customer support workers in 2020 in the middle of COVID to outsource."
Intuit,2.0,"Dec 18, 2023",A Very Stressful Work Environment,Software Engineer II,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Los Angeles, CA","Please note that this review is specifically for the Risk & Fraud teams on QuickBooks. Your experience may vary on other teams.

Pros include:
* Fair compensation
* Smart engineers
* Good tech infrastructure
* Very stable company
* Cool products","* Very poor work life balance. The lights never turn off at this company. There are always people working, always messages flying around. I’ve seen engineers being asked to work late even when they’re sick. The work here comes first, then employees second. It's a very demanding environment.
* Can be very chaotic. Sometimes it feels like everything is “on fire"". This is particularly true in the Risk & Fraud space, since fraud attacks can occur at any time, and thus require immediate attention from engineering.
* Many concurrent, tight deadlines leads to a stressful environment which results in many bugs in production. There's never enough time to go back and fix these bugs, since there's always a new, high priority initiative.
* The culture (or lack thereof) is not great here. There simply isn’t time to do anything else other than work on the next high priority initiative. 

The main issue with Intuit is that they prioritize speed over quality. If they would slow down a little bit, they would produce better quality features that result in less customer friction + allow their engineers to fix existing issues."
Intuit,2.0,"Feb 23, 2024",QuickBooks Live Expert positions very different now,QuickBooks Live Bookkeeper,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Atlanta, GA","flexible hours and remote work, benefits at 20 hrs.","More and more cons these days. Little to no control over job roles. New ""expert"" positions are nothing like the original QBO Live expert roles, bearing little resemblance to what one would consider a ""bookkeeping"" position. 
Experts are switched from platform to platform regardless of desire, abilities, skills, years of education, credentials, or career impact.
Bookkeeping tasks are being transitioned to outsourced workers. Current bookkeepers are being placed in customer service, call center help type roles, with more and more sales duties being added daily. (they boil their frogs slowly thinking none will be the wiser).
Intuit is better at shouting their newfound ""values"" than they are at abiding by them."
Intuit,3.0,"Jan 18, 2024",False sense of “we are here for you”,Manager,Former Employee,"Santa Fe Springs, CA","Great pay, benefits, and remote work.
If you keep your head down and do your job, you will be fine as long as you are not in management.","Lots of work and not enough hours approved to complete it.
You will not know where you rank until it’s bonus time.
No one ever knows how the bonus is calculated or why you ranked how you ranked.
Every business unit functions differently (not for the better).
If you don’t do something game changing RECENTLY, you will never move up into a higher position and don’t take your time moving up because you will not get promoted after a while.
Popularity contest atmosphere.
You never know when you’ll get fired.
Leads want your job and will find a way to get it.
Leads are never satisfied - they find things to complain about.
Bonus is discretionary and will be reduced if the business unit numbers are not met."
Intuit,4.0,"Feb 7, 2024",Depends where you work,Staff Offering Program Manager,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","San Francisco, CA","Benefits, chance to work on innovative projects and use some cool tech at a fast pace.","Many projects don't get the go-ahead or get pulled at the last minute due to resource constraints. There are more great ideas than there are people and systems.

Corners are cut in coding & testing leading to re-work.

Mobility moves are encouraged, but the reality is they are difficult to come by, and remaining in the current role can be limiting if you like a challenge."
Intuit,4.0,"Jan 18, 2024","Great company, great leadership, high expectations",Content Designer,Current Employee,,"The company treats you really well, really high compensation, plenty of employee benefits such as WFM furniture, internet coverage, and a wellness stipend. The leadership is clear about what they want, and through regular meetings will make their vision known, allowing you to pivot to whatever you need to to achieve your individual goals while also staying aligned with the overall priorities. Feedback is helpful and consistent, and you are treated with respect. They hire you to be an expert in a specifc domain, and once you're done with training, you own that domain fully. Managers and leaders will defer to you, and you are expected to be able to stay on top of everything you own.","While it is nice to have the level of freedom we have in how we approach solving problems, sometimes a little more guidance would be appreciated. Also, promotions and raises seem to be hard to come by without basically interviewing for an entirely new position. Career growth is possible and encouraged, but takes a long time."
Intuit,5.0,"Mar 4, 2024",Great place to work,Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Bengaluru,"A different experience of tech culture.

Intuit,3.0,"Jan 24, 2024","Intuit is a decent company to work for, but not without flaws",Product Manager,Former Employee,"San Diego, CA","Intuit is a well-known software company that offers products and services for accounting, tax preparation, and financial management. Intuit has a good reputation for being innovative, customer-centric, and socially responsible. Intuit also has a great work culture that fosters collaboration, diversity, and learning. Intuit employees enjoy flexible work arrangements, competitive pay and benefits, and opportunities for growth and development.","However, Intuit is not a perfect company, and it has its share of challenges and drawbacks. Some of the common complaints from Intuit employees are:

Poor work-life balance: Intuit can be very demanding and stressful, especially during the peak seasons and product launches. Intuit employees often have to work long hours, weekends, and holidays, and deal with tight deadlines and high expectations. Intuit employees also report feeling burned out, overwhelmed, and underappreciated.
Political and bureaucratic"
Intuit,5.0,"Feb 19, 2024",Yes - It's really as great as the reviews say it'll be!,QuickBooks Live Senior Expert Bookkeeper,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Rochester, NY","I was skeptical about the good reviews I'd seen and assumed the benefits were better-geared toward PT or FT team members but even as a select-time employee, I am blown away with the benefits. Not only is this paying significantly more than my last role, they've provided me with all equipment needed to do my job and I even get reimbursed for my internet expenses, which was just icing on the cake! There are so many opportunities to earn time-and-a-half pay and we are included in things like getting PTO for our birthday and the annual shut down week. To my surprise, even those benefits are more than I was expecting bc my normal work day is only a 6 hr shift but everyone gets paid for 8 hrs during that time! My leads and manager have been amazing to work with and even though you're WFH in this role, they still go above and beyond to make you feel included in a team. I am working my dream schedule and can take whatever time off I need without feeling chastized or having to come back from vacation to a mountain of work and I also don't have to be responsible to ""cover"" anyone else's shift if/ when they are out. I'm sure that could change depending on your role but for me, this is exactly what I wanted. There are no silly or stupid questions here and everyone is more than willing to go above and beyond to help you feel supported. I couldn't have made a better choice than to give it a try and put my hat in the ring for my dream job - I'm so glad I did!","You DO have to be willing to go with the flow, a bit. Because Intuit takes so much pride in improving as much as possible, there are some instances where there might be little notice to you, your leads or managers about things like a new training, a system update or the need to step up and help out another department. That being said, there is SUCH an emphasis put on the idea of ""here is what we know, so far and we'll get through this as a TEAM"" that you know you're not alone and it all works out. IMO, this keeps things interesting and allows you to learn new things you maybe wouldn't have put yourself out there for previously but I do see where this could be a bit off-putting for some people."

Intuit,5.0,"Feb 15, 2024",Great Work Life Balance,Tax Expert,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Albuquerque, NM",I love the job. It's great if you want to work during the colder months of the year and have your summers off. Totally remote. Very flexible. Intuit invests a lot in training. Good equipment and great support. Pay is comparable to offers I got for local in office work. You can get up pretty fast from entry level to lead and even manager.,You never really know when you return in September or later in December if you are seasonal.
Intuit,4.0,"Feb 14, 2024",Training Needs Help but Great Team to Work With,QB Live Expert Bookkeeper,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",,The team I am with is extremely supportive and helped me with any questions I have. I look forward to the daily huddles I can attend because the team insight is also helpful.,The training I went through focused more on the BOE role and less on the FOE role. Everyone in that training was going to be a FOE. I had to learn quickly on the job the things training didn't cover.
Intuit,5.0,"Feb 26, 2024",Love it here,Seasonal Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"Several years as a Seasonal Expert - helping people get their returns ready, or preparing them for the less certain.

Intuit,3.0,"Aug 20, 2023",Great - if you like staying in your box.,Senior Principal Technical Program Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"Whether I would recommend Intuit to a friend largely depends on their priorities and what excites them. Intuit does offer fantastic benefits and general culture is open and inclusive. Earning potential is high. If you're a person who likes wearing a single hat and staying in your lane, you'll do great. If you're more of the type who likes to take risks, work beyond what you're asked and drive change, you'll be disappointed.","Agility, speed, risk and being willing to do the right thing are spoken but not truly part of the Intuit culture. Intuit does not provide opportunity for people who work beyond their job role. They'll gladly take advantage of it but don't expect to be recognized with job advancement. The people who go above and beyond by doing more than their role requires and challenging status quo, consistently say they feel their skills are eroding due to the limitations and lack of opportunity. Getting ahead at Intuit is more about being liked and who you know rather than the actual value you deliver. Change agents be ware of the cultural constraints. Intuit does not like people who challenge the status quo even when they agree with the direction."
Intuit,4.0,"Feb 4, 2024",Not Challenging - Good for the Corporate Climber ,Marketing Manager,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Sydney,"The Sydney office has a great view and is well equipped with standing desks. 
There’s some really good people who work here but they all tend to leave as it’s not challenging enough and too political.
If you play the game well you can get promoted but it’s a lot of jumping through hoops and playing the social game which may be for some but not those wanting to affect real change.","A graveyard of ‘has-beens’ with very slow processes and old school ways of thinking. 
Makes it very hard to be motivated when you see a lot of smoke and mirrors to avoid doing any real work."

Therefore the benefits offered to Full Time employees (Managers and above) are far greater than to Select Time employees that work 40 hour weeks. - Training is good but training makes it seem like all clients will be simple. Reality is that clients vary drastically and not everything can be covered in training that you can/will experience on a team. - There is no ""ramp up"" for work.

Handsome RSUs - almost equivalent to your CTC with refresh every year,"1. No fast paced learning for PMs as compared to Indian companies. No cutting edge mobile product dev. 2. Highly tech focussed B2B projects that require very few product interventions. PMs are merely doing the job of project managers, most of the time. 3. Odd working hours, your personal life goes for a toss. Most of the meetings are held in the late evening (as late as 10:30pm) since you have to work as per US stakeholders. There are hardly any meting on US late nights like India  4. Since customers are based out of US, Canada, PMs hardly connect or participate in discovery process or identification of customer pain points. Most of the requirements actually come from the business team and PMs here have to just execute the same. 5. Whole focus is to distribute goodies, plan off-sites and other events and not care about employee job feedback, pain points. Employees are rewarded for posting good things on LinkedIn.

-Although the times have changed when it comes to the level of site engagement and events on campus, site leaders are always looking to little fun ways to draw people back to the office and they have networking opportunities within Employee Resource Groups like (Intuit's Women's Network, Intuit Latinos Network, Intuit African Ancestry Network, and Intuit Pride Network)
-$1300 in wellness $ to use for almost anything when it comes to mental and physical health, 40 hrs paid volunteer time, 401k, ESPP, RSUs, Spotlight $ (which is peer to peer $ that we can give for above and beyond contributions), infertility benefits (IVF, etc), Back up child care 20 days allowance)","The base pay isn't that competitive compared to other large tech companies, but is still decent. There are also a lot of shifts in priorities, so you have to be able to be okay with pivoting FY to FY which doesn't allow you to go too deep into the strategies that you set."

-Racial discrimination is real here, most minorities feel that there is a lack of opportunity and that the majority has the advantage when opportunities are presented.

-This company boast inclusive but it's a pretty gift 🎁 that's empty. These words mean nothing. 

-The pay doesn't equal to the work as a Bookkeeper. You have several clients which makes it difficult to keep track.

-The QBO dept is very unorganized, they are constantly making changes. Which makes it difficult to do your job efficiently.

-Bi weekly pay, which limits cash flow, with an already tight competitive pay scale."

The work culture is collaborative, fostering a sense of unity among team members.

Supportive Leadership: The management team is approachable and genuinely cares about employees' well-being. Regular check-ins and open communication channels make it easy to voice concerns.

Career Growth: Intuit prioritizes professional development. I've had the opportunity to attend various trainings and take on challenging projects that have significantly contributed to my skills and career growth.

Innovative Approach: Intuit encourages innovative thinking and values creative solutions. This has created an exciting and dynamic work environment.","Workload: At times, workloads can be demanding, requiring effective time management. However, this can also be seen as a testament to the Intuit's commitment to excellence.

Communication Channels: While overall communication is strong, improvement in interdepartmental communication could enhance efficiency."

Intuit,3.0,"Dec 26, 2023",Both good and bad aspects. ,Front End Developer,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Mountain View, CA","Excellent benefits. Health and dental and vision are all provided.

Mostly positive workplace culture. Yelling was rarely heard (in my department). 

Great pay. Ample vacation time. 

Campuses often have many things to do, and nice cafes for food. 

Co-workers are excellent and enjoyable to work with, with a high team spirit.","For engineering, quantity is often valued over quality. If you simply do the tasks assigned to you, that may not be enough, so having to ""find"" extra work is required. Managers may not know how to delegate effectively, and this may result in unexpected termination with zero severance. 

Work outside of normal hours may be expected as well. This may include waking up to alerts at 3am and being expected to join calls until problems are resolved. Part of the industry, but can ruin vacations. And this isn't optional. (Or paid.) 

Management is decent, but often has substantial communication limitations. As well, due to different cultural backgrounds, questions may be asked that are personal and violate the law. They may also manage meeting time exceptionally ineffectively and allow for countless hours of wasted time to occur. In short: way too many pointless meetings. They try hard, but are often not trained properly. 

The company does want to force Return to Office policies a few days of the week, which often results in people working in near empty buildings, thereby requiring wasted time and gas commuting--only to be on Zoom at work.

Keep in mind that it's a tax software company. A lot of the work can become excessively dull over time. It can be very rewarding at times, but also incredibly boring as well. Again ""tax software"" isn't the most fun type of business.

Despite all this, the benefits do outweigh the cons. At least for a while. From what I experienced, many do put in a few years, and then move on."
