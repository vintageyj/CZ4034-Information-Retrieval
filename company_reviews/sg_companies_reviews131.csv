eBay,1.0,"Feb 2, 2024",The Slow Death of a Giant,Operations Specialist,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"-The compensation when first starting is great. Possibly slightly lower pay than other companies, but great benefits.
-Great work life/home life balance depending on team.
-Incredibly smart and talented people to learn from and work with.
-Dependent on team, but many managers lead with empathy and understanding. You are treated like an adult and expected to be able to self motivate.","-Compensation goes downhill the longer you stay.
-Making any headway on new projects is near impossible. A lot of meetings with zero progress made, and unless you're working on something flashy, you'll be given zero resources and encounter active roadblocks to progress and change.
-Lack of ownership and accountability. If internal systems exist for specific vertical information, it's outdated. More often than not, it doesn't exist.
-Appearance is more important than actual performance. Office politics are intense and it's not what you know, it's who you know.
-ELT lacks transparency and clear communication. The strategy is always working, even when it's not. 
-Regular layoffs that are not performance based. The only warning you may receive will be a company wide email at the end of business the day before anyone knows if they're impacted or not.
-The company has lost sight of what made it great."
eBay,5.0,"Feb 19, 2024","Excellent culture, excellent employer, but embrace frustration",Mid-Level Manager,Former Employee,,"- A unique and incredibly employee-supportive culture
- Equality, inclusion and diversity are not only reasons of pride for the company, but we live them every day
- We all really work to enable everyone building your own business 
- Extremely customer centric, we listen to our customers, we know what they need (but we are not able to deliver, see Cons)
- One of the most known brands on earth, used by million people every day
- Beautiful offices around the globe
- Smart, supportive, competent and friendly colleagues","- Slow, over-engineered, over-complex. Building a simple customer solutions takes years. 
- Decision-by-committee, rounds of 30 people to discuss features, VPs vetoing AB tests, hours and hours of meetings that bring nowhere 
- Get used to structural changes every year, I have colleagues that had ten different managers in six years
- Leadership levels seem disconnected from the reality of the delivery work. Talking about things that exist only in powerpoint decks"
eBay,4.0,"Mar 4, 2024",Good company but needs to focus better,Senior Instructional Designer,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Salt Lake City, UT",eBay provides a lot of intangible benefits for employees and the people who work for the company really want eBay to succeed.,eBay is too top-heavy which clogs up the decision making process. Too many leaders need to have their fingers in every pie and justify their continued role at eBay. Projects drag out as leaders go around and around on decisions that have already been made.
eBay,1.0,"Feb 27, 2024",What is work life balance and progression,Customer Service,Current Employee,,"Great Benifits, good people work here. No other pros",Work your way up to where you want to be. Every coaching session your asked to consider your progress and career and then one day your told your going back to a department in that you start day one in here on. For a company that thrives on the work life balance quote they have really fooled me. I went from core business hours to be told ill be now working shifts till 9pm and full weekends. Never felt so let down or only a number after working so hard for years. Absolutely horrendous. No communication
eBay,3.0,"Feb 1, 2024",Couldn’t Keep Me Busy,Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Draper, UT","Nice People, flexible work schedule, willing to push out deadlines due to practical issues/considerations","On multiple projects with different responsibilities at once, and yet still unclear what needed to be done to the point I didn’t have much to do most days. Maybe different in other departments, but my section I don’t think I heard “I don’t know the answer to that” or “I’m sorry about this problem” once from anyone but me. The more specific my questions about a specification or process got, the more silence I heard. Given the recent layoff (2024) people had reason to be afraid for their jobs."

Line managers really want to help and they do care for you.,"Higher leadership team don't care about the employees. They say the right things but ultimately only care for numbers. Work life balance means very little to them, if at all.
Stress levels cam get very high and no one would do anything about it but tell you to take care of yourself, only to message you moments later to ask if you can jump on a call at 9pm.

Toxic behaviour is not dealt with, and even encouraged by promoting the toxic people."

eBay,2.0,"Oct 30, 2023",A step in the wrong direction,Authentication Center Generalist,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Syracuse, NY","Since eBay's acquisition of my employer, TCGplayer, a lot has changed, but there are still things about my job that I enjoy. I have many years of experience specializing in many different parts of the work we do, and enjoy the ability to do work I excel at, that adds a lot of value. Additionally, I have a lot of great coworkers that make the work environment fun and enjoyable to spend 40 hours a week at.","Regrettably, eBay has made a mess of their acquisition of TCGplayer in many ways. For a large company with a long history of purchasing other companies, the transition from to eBay's systems, pay structure, and benefits were very poor, despite having a dedicated transition team meant to facilitate these processes. Additionally, eBay was eager to continue TCGplayer's stance of poor cooperation with their democratically elected union, from running a highly aggressive anti-union campaign during the union election process, to delaying the bargaining processes with baseless legal appeals. Beyond this, our pay has been stagnant for the last 3 years, does not account for the cost of living or rising inflation. Additionally, we have seen a reduction in available paid time off since the eBay acquisition."
eBay,2.0,"Feb 26, 2024","Reasonable pay, zero growth",Operations Specialist,Former Employee,"Dublin, Dublin","Pay is decent, atmosphere is amicable.",Disorganized.

eBay,2.0,"Jan 26, 2024",Disconcerting,Software Engineer II,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,If you're a full-time employee you will definitely be able to learn a lot. Benefits are incredible.,"Extremely variable experience depending on your manager. Lots of meaningless meetings. Incredibly difficult to get anything done in an appreciable window of time. Vitriolic levels of workplace toxicity, backed up by almost every amicable team member I'd worked with jumping ship in the span of a few months. Also assigned responsibilities highly disproportionate (i.e. in excess) to my actual job level / compensation. Nobody is motivated and a lot of blame-shifting all around. It is an absolutely thankless role, exacerbated by employees I knew did legitimately earnest / above-and-beyond work getting laid off regardless simply to meet upper management headcount culling. It's depressing since none of this was at all the case when I entered."
