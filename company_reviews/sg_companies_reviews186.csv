With a startup's fast pace, there was a lot to do and create, but we felt cared for and treated as people. We wouldn't say we were like a family, however, we called ourselves a ""tribe"".","After being acquired and joining Encora Inc., there is the feeling of slowly becoming another global offshore company. Policies are being created fast and with lots of effort, but they probably fall short as more people need to be involved in this critical project. 
Compliance training is very generic, and dull, with old repetitive information and unfortunately, cultural nuances are not usually considered in the company.
The company seems to try to complete a checklist of very important topics that every global company should follow, but some of those topics (like DEI) feel rushed in and not sincere, except only for the initiatives created by the employees. 

In Mexico, specifically, communication from top to bottom is not good at all, promises were made and were not respected (gympass and salary reviews in 2022), and the big problem here is that we only realized that they were not gonna happen because people started to ask what was going on.
