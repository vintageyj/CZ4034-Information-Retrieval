Be ready to be on calls at 6AM and 9PM on the same day 3-4 times a week and get paid below the market. You WILL be judged for not being available 24/7. Compensation and promotions are a 'buddy system' and double standards are ubiquitous with the management “clique”. Bait and switch in terms of responsibility when accepting roles, you will manage double what is originally mentioned. When numbers dip ever so slightly, downsizing happens FAST. You have no decision rights on your products, upper managment will make decisions for you then look to you for answers when things go south.
