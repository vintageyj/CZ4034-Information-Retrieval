And if Chinese is your first language, you’d fit right in. Oh, there’s a free mediocre coffee machine & water dispensers.","For starters, this is a far outcry from the typical Silicon Valley high-tech companies. There are no real perks other than the mandated 401K & health benefits. The bonuses and raises are a joke since it’s based on favorites. I’ve heard many coworkers who have been here for over 10+ years that haven’t gotten a raise in the last 3-4 years! There are no improvements for growth, unless you kiss 4$$ hard and show that you stay at work past 8pm regularly (and show up before 9am, of course). Then they growth is for you to have more responsibility (and possibly some bonus). It’s been a revolving door here and in the first quarter alone, we’ve lost ~20% of the employees, some even ran out the door as quickly as 6 days!! There is no sense of pride, ownership or community here at ASUS, but what you have is a sense of distrust (you have to log every emails and minutes of your work in the system), unvalued and under-appreciated.

Like other reviews mentioned, there is high-turnover and therefore management consists of  employees who have moved into roles not based off of their qualifications but their tenure. Many of the high level managers have poor communication and people skills. You can often find them displacing blame to lower level employees/contractors instead of attempting to fix the ""root cause"" of the issue (a core value they often stress). 

The systems they have in place are laughable but instead of making any attempt to fix it, they ultimately lack of ownership and accountability when things go wrong. 

They set RIDICULOUS expectations KNOWING their processes, applications, and systems are 70% of the problem. Absolutely baffling approach in this day and age. 

And yes, there are a lot of politics here."

Parts shortages back up outbound repairs. Very little internal communication, the left hand rarely knows what the right is doing.

They want to know where you are and what you do while you are at work. You cant even take break walking around building or socialize with other teams ( the reason for that because you bother your coworkers doing their jobs) They come up with their own KPI calculation to review your performance but who knows how they calculate it. You need to be friend with  mangers in order to get a better bonus and less work. This company has bad working environment, all managers have no education in management.  There is no way to get promotion at works because of favoritism. Newer people jump into different job title even thought they are not qualify for it; simply answer they are in friend zone with managers. Also, there is a huge raise that they will tell you that noone else can get a raise like you did - 40 cent !!! get a 40 cent raise in 6  years working there is what I can say about this company."

They lack moral standards when it comes to owning responsibility and do the absolute bare minimum to get by.  This mindset is woven into every department throughout the company. Because of this, a lot of undesirable qualities and working conditions arise. The employee demographics are very skewed and lack diversity. Employees are constantly complaining around the office which makes for a very depressing atmosphere. The office location is not great. The facility is horrifying. All three flagpoles are left empty out front, while the neighboring companies fly the USA, California, and Company flags. This is not the cliche happy, forward-thinking, California technology company. I cannot confidently recommend this company to anyone.

ASUS,2.0,"Aug 26, 2013",Poor management/culture,Service Support Specialist II,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Fremont, CA","Employee's
-Immediate team co-workers are nice and helpful

Stable employment
- If you work in the service/support team your job is very stable. Cannot say the same for sales since there are new people every 6 months.

Company Events
2-3 events a year. Usually a company winter party (February) and a event in the summer (July).","Lack of training 
- New products come out all the time and there is absolutely ZERO training on these products. You can acquire an item to test however it would take about 2-3 days to finally receive this unit. Due to the lack of training your customer support quality will suffer. If someone complains to management about the poor support, you will be to blame even though there is non-existent training. I cannot emphasize how ridiculous the lack of training here is. 
- When you start you are taught how to do 1 task, that is it. Everything else is up to you to ask/inquire about. 
-Requesting training is an option? Co-workers and myself have requested training on various products several times within the last year. It took nearly 7 months of constant requesting to receive 1 general tablet training. Expect Google to be your best training

Work load
- You will be given a mass amount of work. I believe I am a fast and efficient employee while maintaining quality and there are days where you will have 2-3 days of work to complete on 1 day. 
- Key Performance Index(KPI) - You will need to keep track of each assignment you do every day and log it. This means every phone call, every email, every chat, anything you do; you need to keep track of it otherwise you will not receive credit for doing them. This wastes a lot of time meanwhile you have several other tasks that you can be spending this valuable time on. Upper management has a target goal for you to reach, 100% of workload. They also say that it is not possible to hit 100%. What? How can I not hit 100% even if I am working as hard as I can? If you do hit 100% or close to it, they will adjust what they are expecting from you.

Employee's
- Other team's are very lazy to help you out, but if they want some help they will not hesitate to ask.

Compensation
- There is 2 bonuses in the year depending on if you receive them (January/July) and 1 raise (July). It is not a guarantee that you will receive a bonus and or raise. If you are working in the service department do not expect a raise higher than 1 - 3%. Earning less than 40k a year this will come out to $400-$1200 at best.

Opportunities at ASUS
- Very low possibility of career growth at ASUS. If you work here for 2-3 years you might be able to move up to the manager of your direct team. After this step you will be unable to move any higher you can only move to another team.

ASUS Fremont Facility
- Not very clean. Rats are known to be an issue here so do not put any type of snack or bars in your drawers. A few snakes were found in the warehouse as well.

Human Resources
- Will watch you when you go on your break and report you to your manager. I requested PTO one day to leave at 4:30 and my manager was not here. HR sent my manager an email saying I left early. Can't HR check the system before reporting to management?"

- Average to low average pay
 believe that we would retain higher caliber employees if compensation was better, I consider if I can really make a long term career here 7 - 10 years out

- High turnover
It seems too high and people here use ASUS as a stepping stone to somewhere else 

- Old Building
Nothing that exciting about the building, its not the worst either, but considering the size of the company, the facility should be larger and nicer 

- Lack of training
Our training process for each position is sparse at best, its definitely a sink or swim mentality, be better to have more structure in learning the specific roles and creating a shared database for referencing job functions and how to use the internal systems, left to your own devices much of the time, which builds your personally but hurts synergy"

Life can get comfortable because work is easy and repetitive. You never have to take your work home unless you are sales/PM. The people there are mostly new college grads so it feels somewhat like college. It's fairly easy to make friends if you are young since everyone is somewhat in the same boat. There's always work to be done so if you like being busy the day can go by really quickly.","High turnover of staff because management does not put any effort into retention. Low salary so mostly new grads are hired and management does not know how or does not have time to train them. Employees who have been there for a long time basically have to lead by example, or new employees have to make mistakes before learning how to deal with issues. Therefore there is a feeling of always falling behind and never catching up. Management makes it difficult to resolve any problems or put any processes in place to stop the issues from continuing. The departments have a very ""us vs. them"" mentality as someone else had mentioned; thus there is no interdepartmental team work and lots of finger pointing. This can cause for uncomfortable meetings or hostile environment. Many employees can be seen working more than 8 hours, especially for those who need to be in contact with Taiwan HQ."
ASUS,3.0,"May 10, 2019",Working with ASUS,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","Fremont, CA","The pros at ASUS are they offer 401K, health benefits and lots of different in house workshops to help improve management as well as health competitions and creative workshops where you can make stuff for holiday's.  We have an amazing workout room, game room and basketball court.  Free coffee. water and ice. Lots of Microwaves to heat your food and beautiful patio section to eat at during the warm days.  The new office is very warm and welcoming and the people are friendly. I love what I do and appreciate the many opportunities I have been given while here.",To many cliques who do not welcome new or other employees. Workload expectations are ridiculous.  For tenured employees the pay is not that great and you do not get the same respect as the newer employees. Continue to work hard and show your dedicated but you get nothing in return.   Employees who are new get awards however older employees get overlooked for new opportunities within the departments and or an award other than the plaques for the years you've been here.  Vending machines are over priced but thanks for having them because the food places aren't close enough to walk. Overall just need for managers to show more compassion to their employees and provide better assistance with workload.

Extremely low pay and management is watching over every move you make. You’re required to record every task that your doing especially the time when you to the restroom.

I know this review is based on my experience. I managed to have the same experience from former and current employees at ASUS. From the outside it seemed like good place join but there’s has been a cycle of issues that goes on here."

ASUS,1.0,"Jan 1, 2019",ASUS: In Search Of Disposable Labor,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Fremont, CA","The health care, vision, and retirement benefits are good. Then you realize they just barely cover California's basic guidelines for company provided health care (good luck trying to cover your spouses and dependents). Also, you'll be using your PTO to go to the doctor since the company has no sick days. As far as other positives, there are water machines, overpriced vending machines, and the new building on Kato Road is miles ahead of where they used to be in Fremont. If you're lucky, you can also bond with other unfortunate people who are stuck in the company for personal reasons and make your daily work week more bearable. That or you speak Mandarin.","If you read other reviews, the key takeaway is that the company has poor management and the culture is super Taiwan focused (salary position, mandatory overtime daily with no pay, expectations to put work ahead of personal life, favors Mandarin speakers). If you do decide to ignore those warnings, be prepared for more hurdles. From personal anecdotes, the probationary period was basically no personal training on how to understand basic job functions and to struggle with tasks so you learn how to ""ask for help"" and get used to kissing up to upper management. When you ask basic questions as to why things in the department are run this way, you get answers like ""it's Asus"" or ""that's how I was taught."" When you do get accustomed to the ""it's Asus"" life, you have few options: 1) brown nose to upper management to create a promotion, 2) do as your told and stick to a miserable life at Asus, or 3) leave the company for greener pastures. Regardless of what you chose, if you stay at Asus, you will realize in the long run that HQ controls everything, management only sees you as a metric to their reports to HQ, and your direct manager will let you know you are replaceable should you decide to speak up. I've tried to combat the silly, archaic system for a while only to be told that ""California is an at-will employment state"" and I had other options available to me (basically be fired). Meanwhile all the suck ups to upper management who used to work in Best Buy retail get promoted and establishing a very high school-esque social group and a toxic work environment,  all the while you're trying to prove to HQ why a laptopmag review of Asus products are low compared to big players like Apple, Dell, and HP (hint: your product quality  and support is terrible)."
ASUS,1.0,"Jun 21, 2015",Interviewees Beware!,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Fremont, CA","You get to learn a variety of different skills and handle every aspect of your programs, accounts and campaigns. This means that you're going to gain experience in almost every aspect of the business - from budgeting, events, account management, marketing strategies and product knowledge. Keep in mind that these aren't just things you're getting exposure to, but responsibilities you are expected to maintain.","Travel - per diem = $35/day - you are expected to use your own finances to cover the costs with no guarantee of reimbursement. Also, if you are traveling on the weekends, doing events or meeting with customers, you are not compensated for this extra time you're working. You're also expected to maintain your normal work responsibilities even if you put in 16-18 hour day. 

Management - Flat organization with the President personally involved in your projects accounts and campaigns. Super Micro-managed company culture. 

Benefits - Recently removed tuition reimbursement program, comp days for exceptional performance, and work from home privileges. Health insurance benefits are okay but there are no other perks to working here. No on-site food other than a vending machine; cafeteria contains about 10 microwaves for you to heat your own food and looking for coffee, tea or juice? forget it. You bring your own. The gym is pathetic with 1 treadmill, 1 bike, and 1 elliptical, ping-pong tables and random weights. 

Company culture - 90% Asian. Love you guys, but I'd like to know what you're talking about in meetings. It's also very challenging to communicate because emails are very difficult to decipher. Company work ethic requires you to work overtime - in fact you probably won't get all your work done if you're not putting in at least 2-3 hours of overtime per day, And if you leave on time, it is noticed by everyone. Hours are not flexible."

ASUS,1.0,"Jun 30, 2019",One of the worst places to work for in the Bay Area,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,,Small gym & free coffee,"If all you cared about was having a small gym and free mediocre coffee, then this is the place for you. But if you cared about a company that valued its people, had a great company culture with healthy and supportive team environment, plus helpful managers who would want you to succeed and move up professionally by providing lots of opportunities for growth, or, gave back to the communities by giving time off to volunteer, and provided a work/life balance with flexible work schedule and the ability to work from home,(there’s plenty more to add here but you get the idea), then this isn’t the place for you. 

I did not adhere to the wise advice of those before me and warned about the low wages, expected long hours (if you’re on salary but will ding you for working over for hourly employees), micro managing, favoritism, high-school like cliques, no raises/bonuses for veteran employees, very Chinese/Taiwanese culture, and no perks. It’s almost unheard of that they let you get off early before the holidays. You’re lucky if they let you leave by 5:45pm the day before Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve or NYE, as you know, they are family holidays! To them, 6pm is when you need to leave work or later is better. Anytime before that, you gotta put in PTO for the missing time. A real Scrooge maybe?

High turn over and the highest exodus I’ve seen in any company that was not due to layoffs. It’s almost as if it’s a race now of who can get out of there quicker. I’ve even seen some walked out without giving any notices. Again, favoritism is blatant. Low wages and you only get bonuses or raises if they like you. Some in their 10+ years haven’t gotten a raise of more than 50 cents!! They see employees not as assets but as liabilities. There’s no trust and it’s evident by the mandatory monitoring where you record what you do every minute with a timer. It’s a literal timer on the web that you log on and press start as soon as you get in. They tell you it’s how they can measure what projects we’re working on. Except the fact that the majority of people don’t have multiple projects they work on and secondly, there are no separate budgets for these projects to measure where the hours or work go into. So really, there’s no function of the timer other than to monitor us: what time you get in, what time you leave, how long you take breaks and how much work you do.

It’s funny to read comments by management here that says “you have to love your job to enjoy it” and “you have to love and believe what you do.” Is that best pitch they can give to bring up enthusiasm? Anyone inspired now? But there you have it. I guess a lot of us did not love or believe in a company who does not value its employees."
ASUS,1.0,"Jul 9, 2014",Just a job not a career,Analyst,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Fremont, CA","Stable employment -  Unless you are terrible at your job, you will not get fired.  

Teammates - For the most part, the people on any team are easy to get along with, however it does create a strong ""Us vs Them"" dynamic which is an issue.

Work Life - Full benefits for regular employees.  Able to take time off as needed.  You will not be fired for taking time off.

Products - If you can get hands of a new product, its pretty fun to play with before anyone else is able to.","Training - Learn as you go approach.  No real training but preexisting habits you have to maintain for some reason.

Income - Not up to industry standards.  Bonus entirely depends on your manager.  Raises come very sparsely and in low volume.

Personal Growth - Limited mobility unless you have technical skills.  Nominal funding for higher education.  

Work - Entirely depends on your manager.  Some require daily updates on what you do daily, some don't.  Some people have meetings and high workload, others don't.  Your manager has a vague idea of what they want you to do, then you're pretty much stuck there whether it is good or bad.

Work Life - High stress.  Lots of products coming out, but no additional support to help, so a very strong 'do more with less' culture.  Too many conflicting opinions coming from management and HQ.  Very low communication between teams and management.  High attrition and turnover rate.  Company is very frugal in terms of spending for employee comforts and technology upgrades.  

Culture - No one openly discusses the difference in cultures that exist here.  There is a huge discrepancy between Asian and non-Asian lifestyles and its just assumed everyone can merge between the two easily."
