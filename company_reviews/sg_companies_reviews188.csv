Veritas Technologies,5.0,"Feb 23, 2024",Teamwork,Project Manager,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","Santa Clara, CA",Great colleagues. Great products. Great tools.,Nothing to add. There are no CONS.
Veritas Technologies,4.0,"Feb 26, 2024",It's a rollercoaster,Technical Support Analyst,Current Employee,,Good pay. Some good people to work with.,"Lot of turnover at all levels. Constant change of managers, tools, processes, rules. Frequent acquisitions and mergers. Not much concern for employee sanity, or work/life balance. Most holidays are worked and weekends are also worked on a 3wk rotation. Micro-management is the current theme."
Veritas Technologies,3.0,"Feb 10, 2024",Twelve years gone in an instant. ,Senior Technical Account Manager,"Former Employee, more than 8 years",,"Pay and bennies were decent. Teammates were ride or die. Some managers truly had your back. I genuienly liked working with the customers I had. Despite being a revolving door, Sales was generally helpful as well.","If there was a drinking game where the rule was to take a shot every time Leadership said the word ""Cloud"" on an all-hands, you would be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning in less than an hour. 

This company is on the way to becoming a proxy billing service for Microsoft. They do not have their own cloud infrastructure. It all goes through Azure. When Microsoft changes the rules, they have absolutely no control over it or say in it. 

If I ever hear someone use the term ""Customer Delight"" unironically again, I'm going to throw up. All they care about is numbers. Making customers happy means nothing. Some SVP or Director logs into PowerBI while they drink their coffee, and if the board isn't completely green, the managers get a nastygram. It's a call center. 

""Hey, I know this isn't your product, but I need you to take this four day training with broken labs and then immediately start taking cases. No, there isn't any extra compensation for this. Have you taken any cases yet?""

I'd hope to spend another ten years at this place. I was content with what I did, and I felt no need to climb any corporate ladders. I'd have been happy to retire. If the product I invested a decade of my life into hadn't been left to rot in hospice, it may have happened. As it were, it ended with no warning on an otherwise regular day.

My customers gave me a warmer sendoff than my manager did. That should tell you all you need to know. 

The only thing that truly matters to leaderships is making money for the VC firm that overpaid for the brand back in 2015.

All other priorities are rescinded. 

Crew expendable."

 Leadership: VP Level was condescending, arrogant, and consistently made others feel inferior. Director level leadership - absent/unavailable. When it came to direction/vision/goals, very hands off and vague, not great people management. 

 Culture: antiquated/outdated, just like the products they offer. While HR has all the necessary practices in place to keep up to save face, the culture provided by leadership and long time employees feels disconnected and frankly depressing. A lot of my initial meetings with colleagues were spent hearing them air out their grievances.

Processes: never been part of a company that moves more slowly to get things done in product and development. Communication between the two are incredibly disjointed due to old school practices and lack of formal process.

If you're looking for a modern software/product company who practices agile methodology and delivers on consistent, shorter, intervals with good team collaboration and communication, you'll be left sorely disappointed."
