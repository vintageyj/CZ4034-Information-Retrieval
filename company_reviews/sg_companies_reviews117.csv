Cloudflare,2.0,"Jan 9, 2024",Sales organization in disarray,Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Austin, TX",Great product line that addresses a wide variety of network security use cases.,"Many components of the platform do not perform as well as competitors and its priced higher than comparable solutions. Also many of the important facets of the product can be purchased monthly for cheap, or completely free. This makes is much harder to sell Enterprise plans to a large portion of mid-market customers.

The sales organization segmented nearly 3 times in a one year span. The ripple effect of these changes caused disruption in sales cycles and pipeline generation for the AE and BDR organization.

Sales leadership pulled back on tech resources, tools, and updated marketing collateral which reflects the company’s overall attitude towards enabling and coaching ICs. There’s not much of a focus on proper enablement on products - too many fires to put out and all suggestions fall on deaf ears."

Cloudflare,1.0,"Mar 4, 2024",Beware,Account Manager,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,Good product. Some good people.,"Where to begin? 

-Territories are assigned with absolutely no thought process behind them. How your territory performs is truly luck of the draw. You will also get accounts taken out of your territory with little to no notice. 
-There is no incentive to build long lasting relationships with your customers due to this. Instead there is a mentality of close whatever you can while you can. 
-There is no CSM/CSE aligned to any of your accounts. They all use a pool model. Customers hate the support system and complain that they get rude replies or it takes them weeks to get a response. On top of that, many CSEs are overworked and overbooked. 
-In Mid Market, you will be working with 20 different SE's, just depending on which one is assigned to which account of yours. You have to prep each SE for every customer call you invite them to. Many SE's are not seasoned - they have very low sales skills and rely on you completely as the AE to tell them when to speak. They have no curiosity to help find out more about the customers problems. You'll be lucky if they don't hinder the process, never mind help move it along. 
-If a partner brings a deal to Cloudflare, that customer is locked in with that partner forever. As a sales person you are de-incentivized from moving the customer to a different partner or moving them direct (even if it is what the customer directly asks for). This creates partner relationships where the partner can coast and add no value, yet still make their margin on upsells when the AE does all the work. It also creates dissatisfaction with the customer as they feel they're overpaying for partner services for nothing in return. 
-Sales reps are required to handle renewals even though they do not get paid for them. God forbid you need to make changes to the renewals or the customer wants to downgrade some of their services; internal processes make that incredibly difficult and complex. 
-You can pretty much make pricing anything you want it to be as a rep, which means customers are left confused on what pricing they can expect. One rep may extend a discount of 70% to a customer, and that will be the expectation when they are moved to a different rep even years down the line, creating dissatisfaction and lack of trust with the new rep that can no longer get that high of a discount approved. 
-Customers complain of lack of visibility/transparency when it comes to pricing. 
-Managers are hit/miss but overall I've noticed they are not very experienced, have not seen best practices at other companies, and aren't super helpful in advocating for their reps. 
-Layoffs for no defendable reason, letting go talented reps who haven't even gotten a chance to fully ramp and who receive positive feedback in performance reviews
-You may get hired for one role and in 6 months be told you're covering a completely different patch and type of customer
-Pay is below average
-Severance for layoffs is extremely minimal 
-no 401k match
-rising costs for the healthcare plans
-CEO is toxic, inexperienced in building strong sales organizations/processes, and regularly belittles sales org
-Many folks have left due to questionable unethical business practices, management issues, favoritism, and other worse issues... It is a widespread issue across all geographies and teams.

It is such a shame because the Cloudflare product line is incredible and the company has so much potential. But currently there are just too many issues that cannot be ignored."

Cloudflare,1.0,"Jan 11, 2024",You Are Set Up To Fail Within The Sales Org,Account Executive,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,- Great Product and benefits.,"The morale at CF has been in the gutter since the CEO publicly shamed the sales org last year & with the 2024 layoffs. Alongside the consistent fear of wondering if this is going to be your last day at your job, the sales ops and processes behind the scenes are some of the worst I've seen in all of the tech space. For each deal, you spend more time processing a deal than actually being customer-facing. The leadership team said they were aware of the issue and were going to focus on simplifying the process, but it's gotten much, much worse. 

Along with the layoffs in 2024, I have heard that BDR's who got promoted to AE beginning of Q4 were also let go. They had little to no training in the role & with an average sales cycle of over 6 months, it is almost impossible to hit their number, let alone get established in the role. Also, BDR team leads were demoted to BDR's, and AE managers were demoted to AE. 

During my tenure, I have NEVER SEEN executive leadership or the CRO chat with any of the immediate sales team or gain first-hand insights from individual reps on what's working and what's not. It's quite pathetic, to be honest. Ethier the CEO, COO, or CRO chooses to be ignorant of how much of a mess the SalesOrg is or just not care because they don't believe in sales in general. Plus, I have also never seen so many reps who were quota crushers at their previous company struggle to hit even 30% of their number. 99% of reps are great sellers, and greater people of character, but the sales culture is so much of a mess that you are not enabled to do your best work. 

And, when you cut INCREDIBLE SALES folks who have been within the Cloudflare culture and who have taught other new sales folk how to do your job, the employees that you will replace will have even a GREATER CHALLENGE to their role, causing even more issues. Has any of this been properly thought out?! 

Bottom line- You are set up to fail within the CF sales org. When the CEO takes pride pubically in individually hand-crafting and sending offer letters to every single new employee, there is also a weight of responsibility of taking accountability for your actions when you don't provide teams the culture and foundation to do their best work. I hope that executive leadership sees the challenges FIRST HAND within the sales org & acts fast, or it's going to be more ""putting lipstick on a pig"" and wondering why things aren't getting better."

When I started there was a ""lead with empathy"" attitude by everyone. Now, and especially since new CRO Marc Boroditsky came in, it's much more fear based and robotic. Marc began subtly reducing AE's compensations in sneaky ways and certainly got the ball rolling for Matthew's embarrassing Q1 '23 earnings call where he literally called all of his success from the last 10 years solely because of the strength of the product (Matthew doesn't care about sales people at all FYI).

- Unlimited PTO goes well with zero accountability culture","First thing I need to highlight is the engineering culture is highly toxic, during my time at CF, I've encountered the following:
- High confrontation (getting yelled at publicly in meetings, getting massive downvotes and negative emojis in chat threads when folks don't agree with you, lack of respect for people as humans)
- Gaslighting (after raising concerns about a teammate's behavior towards me in meetings and code reviews, manager literally just responded with ""don't take it personally, they're just trying to attack the problem"" - classic tiptoeing response to avoid addressing respect and empathy)
- No concept of ""disagreeing and committing"", a lot of engineers at CF are smart, but are jerks. There's a lot of folks who are credible in terms of their individual talent, but certainly are not likeable. When a decision has been made, instead of respecting and committing to the decision, I've seen and was horrified by the unprofessionalism directed towards the decision makers.

Another big problem that I've experienced that continues to be an issue at CF is lack of valuing employees:
- Low compensation (I made it a big concern that I was not fairly compensated, especially when CF's stock plummeted, I made a case that I could literally go anywhere else and have my TC doubled, I was told off both by my management chain and by HR, so guess what? I interviewed and found a new role that doubled my TC.)
- Deceit (a huge red flag when I initially joined was that the recruiter I was working with flat out lied about how he didn't know what my level will be when I joined, he also mumbled something along the lines of ""we don't do levels at CF"" - this was downright false, and I was brought in a P3, when the level that matched my experience was supposed to be P4)

Unless you're particularly excited about CF's mission, I would avoid at all costs. Even if I didn't receive another offer, I would have needed to leave soon since my mental health was deteriorating based on what I experienced above."

They were realigning and refining territories into Q2 & Q3 as well. - Matthew (CEO speaks poorly of Sales reps and accounts all success to the great product.

Matthew Prince dislikes salespeople and that attitude filters down. -Almost no training; 3 months of boot camp that doesn't resemble the job, at all. Management just tells you ""send more emails."" I'm not exaggerating. The sales org worked in a bull economy, and now almost zero pipe is being generated because their methodologies don't actually work. Zero in-seat training. -Sales ops team is like one person. If you need any help building out reports, etc, you're on your own -Company pushes you to generate 4x pipeline which is comically unrealistic, especially in Digital Native, which has been wrecked by the economy -Some of the senior managers couldn't sell water in a desert.

Read the call transcript from the Q1 earnings call where he says that in good times salespeople are just order takers and in bad times “we get to see who isn’t wearing any shorts”. This was his excuse for cutting 100 people from the org, while touting 37% year over year growth in Q1. I think the motivation was to pay shareholders a dividend and himself a fat bonus. Unless you see 100 new open requisitions posted in the next 90 days, this was in fact a layoff. Just days before being cut I was reassured that my position was secure. I wasn’t even on a Formal PIP. In my time here there were ever changing ROEs, they took away essential clarity and removed incentives, and at one point the team spent 6 months without guidance on which accounts were even ours to work. Then they blame the reps for a dip in performance. It’s poor leadership on a grand scale and they have no idea how to run a best in class channel sales organization."
