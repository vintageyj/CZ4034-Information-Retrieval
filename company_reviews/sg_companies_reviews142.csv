Splunk,5.0,"Feb 23, 2024",Great,Regional Sales Manager,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Plano, TX",Best job I’ve ever had,Territories can be tough for some. If you have a good territory you’re set.
Splunk,2.0,"Dec 21, 2023",Coasting until the acquisition,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,Splunk has amazing benefits. The best health plans and perks I have ever encountered in my career. A handful of good eggs across several orgs make it bearable. Decent work life balance but the writing is on the wall as layoffs continue and the survivors are left having to do several jobs instead of one.,"Where do I begin? This is not a place for careee growth, it’s where you can get by and coast until retirement (the average age at this org is up there). If you are part of the inner circle, you are set for life. No amount of trying to fix the limitless red tape and poor process will get you anywhere. It is impossible to do your job with slow or broken tools. People who have never done your job are in charge of how it gets done. Why? I have spent two years here and no one can tell me how to get promoted. I have had four bosses in the same time and same BS. 

The inclusion delusion here is wild. Splunk likes to go on and on about its inclusivity yet you sit on call after call where you’re the only woman, only POC, or both. 

They cut 7% of jobs and then celebrate a “successful quarter”. 

The only way to stay sane here is to find stuff outside of work that makes the groundhog’s day of a job here worth it. For your manager it’s buying a boat or something."
Splunk,2.0,"Feb 3, 2024",It’s becoming a joke,Regional Sales Manager,Current Employee,,Work life balance and benefits,"No career growth at all. They will promote who they want, no matter how good or bad they are at their job.

Leadership rarely knows how to run a sales cycle. They just get on a call and say give me the p.o but don’t know how to do any of the background jobs 

Everyone is leaving after this Cisco acquisition. People are going to make so much money on the stock so they are coasting.

Product is getting passed up and the company doesn’t want to admit it.

If you want to work here, make sure you’re at a majors or enterprise account or higher. Leadership started this commercial growth segment and not 1 person hit quota in America. Average quota attainment was probably around 25-30% for reps but the directors were around 60-80%. Bigger account reps dominated."
Splunk,3.0,"Feb 9, 2024",Not the Splunk it used to be,Regional Sales Manager,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"Pay, Benefits, unlimited PTO, very nice and smart co workers",I have never seen so much great and intelligent talent to leave the company. Commercial Growth segment was a joke. No one hit the quota and they laid them all off. They also wanted RSMs to sell through partners which only complicated the process even more since not all of the partners even know what Splunk does. Competition is bitting them for sure. They are trying to sell premium product to small and medium businesses and they failed miserably. Upper leadership doesn't know what they are doing ( they don't even know how to sell the solution). Since Garry joined the company the culture is getting worse and worse.
Splunk,1.0,"Feb 22, 2024",Much worse than a year ago and very toxic now,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,You can do your own thing at all times and tee up a ton of stuff.,No vision. New executive leadership is inexperienced and faking it while they destroy everything they touch. Nothing ever gets shipped and everything is now top down. If you ask clarifying questions or idea share you will be pulled aside and called insubordinate. Team meetings now consist of exec talking about how smart they are and everyone else is around just to be seen so they keep their job. Its every man for themselves now with 0 career growth opportunities. Best way to describe it is - toxic and on the verge of becoming a career killing organization.
Splunk,3.0,"Feb 21, 2024",They treat you like you're still in college,Business Development Representative (BDR),"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Dallas, TX","-Easy to meet quota when I worked there
-Collaborative environment 
-Fun culture (at times)","The dynamic is so similar to that of being in college. Leadership will require you to complete homework like assignments and congratulate those that kiss a** rather than those that consistently meet quota. Extra points if you create a slide deck on a random process that really doesn't require documentation. When you're doing well they'll ""promote"" you laterally with no pay increase."
Splunk,4.0,"Mar 7, 2024",Great,Digital Marketing Manager,Former Employee,"San Francisco, CA",great place to work for parent,not enough room for opportuniy to grow career
Splunk,4.0,"Jan 29, 2024",Great job until you have significant personal life events or hardship,Technical Support Account Manager,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Austin, TX","- High degree of independence and role empowerment
- Great benefits
- Opportunity to work with brilliant people, cutting-edge technology","- Frequent emerging product issues and incidents due to significant product and corp structure complexity/distributed responsibilities = high pressure environment
- Frequent, significant change (organizational and product direction). Managers are hit or miss and depending on your role you may be passed around to different bosses more frequently.
- Some managers are more or less understanding about work/life balance, personal life issues and significant life events. I returned from paternity leave, was assigned to a new manager (both new to me and new to his role) who was not a good match and caused me a lot of undue stress
- Big company = big layoffs"

Splunk,2.0,"Feb 12, 2024",Eh,Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"Friendly co-workers, remote, decent pay",-No job stability. There are constant layoffs and everyone who is halfway paying attention to the plot realizes that Cisco is going to wipe 20% of Splunk off the board. ELT is also actively avoiding difficult questions. They pack the weekly townhalls with meaningless nonsense and leave maybe 2 minutes for questions - this is clearly deliberate.
Splunk,2.0,"Feb 1, 2024",Its getting a little top heavy.,Principal Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 10 years","San Francisco, CA","Core technology is still strong, amazing, and ready to handle more. 
Passionate, intelligent, and very approachable employees, although the ones who truly grasp the deep technology that makes Splunk work are unfortunately being replaced by the directed ""just know enough"" approach,","Culture has shifted from the ""Go above and beyond for Splunk"" to the ""Just check the boxes"" approach, which stifles work enjoyment and limits innovation. 
Product direction is continuously changing and negatively impacting delivered quality and substance."
Splunk,2.0,"Jan 27, 2024",Steady Decline,Regional Sales Manager,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,Was a great company. Technology has gotten “long in the tooth” with little to no innovation. Benefits are great. Sort of a “semi-retirement” kinda vibe.,"As Cribl stated “some companies choose to innovate and others choose to litigate”. Splunk has had a steady, slow decline. Competition has blown by them. Upper management is weak, mostly due to all the talent leaving over the past 5 years so the leftovers are now at the top. Splunk is more concerned with image versus reality….sad to witness."

World class products.",Many account decisions are made my upper leadership without consulting the account team. It has lead to disjointed relationships and loss of trust with customers.
Splunk,2.0,"Nov 29, 2023",Employees No Longer Matter,Senior Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,Good benefits and smart employees.,"Splunk is not the same place it was before Gary Steele joined, the culture has gone out the door and employees are now just a number, overworked, and undervalued. The number of steps to complete anything are over-processed, want to sneeze - you need 5 approvals and 10 steps to make sure you sneeze right - and as a result nothing is ever completed on time and employees don't feel trusted to do their best work because they are told constantly it isn't good enough. In all my years and companies, never seen so many smart people undervalued and a power hungry leadership who thinks they only know the answers."

And great Management (immediate Leaders and ELT)

But after the exit of its great CEOs the culture had deteriorated and new ELT and leadership just want to save their positions and visibility leading into politics and mismanagement and little to no growth environment.

Its full of favoritism and no ideal place now what it used to be.

This is my honest review."
Splunk,5.0,"Feb 22, 2024",Great company,Global Certification Program Specialist,Current Employee,"Atlanta, GA",Great work/life balance and good pay,Have a hard time back-filling roles
Splunk,2.0,"Jan 3, 2024",Honest review on diversity,Sales,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Chicago, IL","Good brand name, onboarding is great, teammates, clients are good references.","Diversity programs are not private 
Constant turnover in sales due to lack of diversity and treatment of employees who request help from their managers and are punished and ignored for their reporting 
Not a good place for women and LinkedIn can show the lack of diversity and inclusion 

They Hire younger people and fire or layoff workers who are mostly over paid and over 50 years of age 
HR is not your friend and will hide or ignore any information that you report and their follow up will never be shared with senior management 
Management is micromanaging at very senior levels that does not allow for strategic vision from the sales reps- weekly reporting of every single task is required in slack and this is from a specific group of managers 
Limited customer support for serious needs and you are required as a sales rep to do the job of sales engineers, services and other employees jobs. It is almost impossible for a sales person to focus on strategy when there are other jobs they have to perform. 
Customers are very unhappy with so many changes and management decisions for the long term may be difficult but the lack of planning with the customers affected sales performance 
Your personal data is not protected by HR labor laws 
If you leave the company and apply at other employers the same people at the company will speak about an employee negatively and do not follow up on a single complaint. I have witnessed the derogatory comments about other employees to potential employers this should be stopped immediately as it is highly against the law. 
Layoffs and terminations focused on older women 
Sales commissions are at the discretion of HR and not labor laws 
Reporting any type of sexual misconduct is ignored by HR and they do not follow up - do not report any misconduct or you will be fired 
Several people on medical leave were fired upon return and these were mostly women 
Some of these firings took place within days of their full vesting after 4 years of hard work 
Senior management promotion of women are limited and this is a good ol boys club 
Require daily or weekly updates in slack to micromanage your team weekly work - this is a practice for a very junior team not those that have worked in their careers for many years. 
Customers are exhausted from the constant changes that don’t seem to reflect their needs first 
Requests for meetings to resolve serious disputes are ignored and blocked by HR
HR decides if you are paid on your commission and ignore the law that requires commission to be paid in full
HR uses derogatory language during layoffs and termination and violates employee confidentiality and privacy 
Stock is used as a retaliation against any employee who does not adhere to their mid level manager and threatens those who want to report harassment wjth being fired 
Managers will ask you to lie about deals and there is a problem with lack of diversity 
The discrimination is very common and this was happening for many years. 
Requests to speak to senior management is blocked or you are fired- note thst this is not widespread and only a handful of staff members are promoting this type of workplace neglect 
Stock is not worth the time because they will find any reason to lay off workers to avoid paying their options and earned salaries 
Managers are not experts or experienced managers and favors men vs women.
If you are over 40 years of age you are definitely not a good fit"

New CEO seems like his head’s in the right place.","They are actively cutting benefits like equity, bonuses, etc. to cut costs at the behest of new investors and - for the first time in 20 years - actually be a profitable business. You will have to CYA to a maniacal degree to protect yourself from your co-workers. Despite an overcompensating degree of ERGs, DEI measures, etc., it’s a toxic environment. Everyone knows the party’s over, but they’re just trying to stay in for as long as they can - and they do that by trying to throw each other under the bus. A comical overabundance of middle management, with many rookie managers who really just make everyone miserable and everything worse and more complicated. They rose into leadership to fill gaps after a large number of people left in 2020 and 2021."

The good news is that with the overwhelming feedback from across the company around tech debt and lack of operational efficiency, the leadership team took that feedback and rolled out new process and tools to address this.

Splunk,2.0,"Jul 18, 2023",New Leadership Is Horrendous,Principal Recruiter,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Palo Alto, CA",- Pay - Benefits - Work Life Balance,- Zero opportunities for promotion. - Internal opportunities are limited. - New leadership and ELT are clueless and don't care. - The talent acquisition leadership is absolutely tone deaf. They took a great org and demolished it. They implemented new tools and processes that are horribly time consuming and make no sense. The VP and TA Director have no idea how to recruit. They are very cutthroat and will throw you out the door if you don't agree with them and play the politics game. They have no interest in getting to know you or defend you. They will constantly call you out and take the business's word over yours so document everything!!
