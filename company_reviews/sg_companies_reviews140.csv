- HR is quite active and they hold many plans for Employees to keep them aware in terms of Legal rights, Compliance, Soft Skills and many other programmes which is hard to catch all but It's good to see it's happening.
- Tech teams are very talented, supportive and kind. There are my activities hold by Tech teams internally to help each other learn and improve.
- Lunch, dinner and OT cab vouchers.
- Healthy work environment. At least my TL and team looks zero politics so far.
- Room to grow. There are always works on the air and sometimes you can pick it and have it along with routine tasks. (non-infra) TLs are quite helpful in that.
- CEO understands the business which ships a confidence to what we do (Even though sometimes he is making micro-management, breaking priorities and ignoring PMs)
- Nice work place","- No WFH policy.
- Not so mature work flow and process. yet
- Still there are meeting with sudden change to Mandarin. Hopefully TLs are serious about improving it. Encouraged non-english speakers to take language tests."

OKX,5.0,"Jul 24, 2023",The most exciting place I have worked at,Compliance Analyst,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"OKX is a company that is truly becoming a powerhouse in the crypto industry and for anyone who loves crypto and wants to see it thrive, this is the place to be. Unlike my previous jobs that were slow, mundane, and boring, working at OKX has been fast paced and full of excitement. It feels like I am working on something new almost every week and the people here are down to earth and great to work with. While this fast paced atmosphere can be demanding at times, I will say that this is also a company that notices and rewards hard working individuals. They promote hundreds of people internally every year and the opportunity for career advancement is certainly there for anyone who is willing to put in the work. The benefits for US employees are very good as well.","The compensation for P4/P5 of the US compliance team seems low compared to other competitors in the industry and traditional finance. In an industry where compliance is becoming more essential everyday, the company will need to change this if they want to recruit and retain top talent."

It's refreshing to know that your contributions are valued, no matter where you are on the corporate ladder. Innovative Environment: OKX fosters an innovative environment where employees are encouraged to suggest and drive new features. This creative freedom allows us to contribute to the company's growth actively. Also founder comes from a engineering background - provides a great insight to products. Recognition from Management: I appreciate how our management team consistently acknowledges and credits employees for their hard work. It creates a motivating atmosphere where dedication is truly appreciated. Competitive Compensation: OKX offers competitive compensation packages, $20 foodpanda lunch + $25 foodpanda dinner every weekday + Monthly teambonding funds + Gym funds + Learning Funds Global Expansion and Language Support: It's exciting to see OKX expanding globally. They invest a lot in fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce, with a strong emphasis on improving English proficiency. This effort truly supports professional growth on a global scale. Also there are quite a number of opportunities to travel overseas to learn from fellow overseas colleagues.","Fast-Paced Industry: The web3 industry is known for its rapid changes, which means our directions can shift quickly. Adapting to this fast-paced environment is crucial, and newcomers should be prepared for such changes. Occasional Longer Work Hours: Some days may require you to work a bit later, especially when certain features demand extra attention. However, this is a common occurrence in the tech world. Global Collaboration: Working with global teams is rewarding, but it may sometimes necessitate adjusting your working hours to align with the schedules of colleagues in different time zones. Flexibility is key in such situations. Languages: In some teams, there might be a need to learn Chinese to facilitate effective communication. However, it's worth noting that many individuals from non-Chinese backgrounds have still been able to collaborate effectively. While language requirements can be a challenge, the company strives to create an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute, regardless of their language skills."

Which may affect the morale of the employee as we do not have time to adapt accordingly. There is still a room of improvement when it comes to changes in processes and also communicating the changes. Although it can be seen that the management does listen and take note on the feedback provided.
