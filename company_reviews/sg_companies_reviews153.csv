I had coworkers crying after their one-on-ones. Management retaliated against employees by firing them when they spoke up about issues. Management ignored technical issues and placed blame on employees. So, bottlenecks created by our hardware limitations were never resolved. Management cut off our line of contact with the client, severely limiting our ability to communicate with them and get feedback. This caused morale to plummet, especially when Management began telling us we weren't sufficient despite the client's previous approval and positive feedback. Management had poor communication skills, and got mad at employees when their inability to communicate effectively led to misunderstandings with employees. Management looked outside the team when they needed to fill leadership positions, rather than promoting from within the team. Our leadership turnover rate was abysmal due to low morale."

There will be no healthcare benefits so don't agree to work here based on that. They do give you Sick Days but you have to prove you were sick by providing a doctors note which makes little sense since they don't provide any healthcare benefits (who sees a doctor for a cold or flu?).

- I appreciate the recognition of my hard efforts, when it is given.
- Raises are significant, when they come.
- Good Work/Life balance in terms of scheduling.","- The gross level of micromanaging is horrific.  Sheets to record what you are doing, every time you do it.  Write an email?  Document it.  Go to the bathroom?  Document it.  They must know what you are doing every minute of every day and will check it three times over.  You need to seriously cool it with this savage, controlling behavior.  Not only is it insulting and distrustful, it it makes all of our jobs more difficult.  We would be 3x more efficient if you didn't have your hand around our throats.

- They like 'busy work' and will have no problem in trying to stretch their agents as thinly as possible for highest possible profit.  If they can convince one agent to work for 3 clients via pressure, they'll pay one person instead of hire three.  And not tell the clients that their agents are also working for other people.  In fact, I was told directly not to tell clients this information and keep it under the blanket.  As clients may not pay KWS as much if they know that the agent's attention is split.

- 'Team Leads' often fumble into their position of management with little to no training or previous management experience.  I've seen them yell, throw fits, and come down on entire teams of agents, demanding they work harder or faster with no compensation.  This in turn drops the quality of an entire team of people and the client's perception of us.  I've even had to correct timesheets that were overlooked by TLs on negligence, costing an agent nearly $400 in monthly pay. 

- Upper management handles feedback poorly and some may even resent you for coming forward with truths - because the truth can sometimes be damaging.  You have to be very careful who you trust and who you talk to if you want to keep your position or work your way up.  It's a social minefield.

- Disorganized management causes the agents to suffer.  Who talked to who about what?  Someone sent an email, but I didn't get it?  One TL was told something that the other TL wasn't and now the agents made a mistake and the client is upset?  Forgetting when people work or pinging agents at 4:00am off shift?  This is common.  This happens near daily.  It's communicative chaos.

I had a TL not even show up on training day because they 'forgot'.  Oh well."

Great coworkers with varied backgrounds and across all ages.

If you are interested in games, you will get to see/try new titles before the public.","The work at Keywords is project based, meaning they will call you in to work X number of days or weeks. In between projects, you will be at home without compensation. When interviewing, they may tell you to expect 2-4 weeks of downtime per year, but this is very far from the truth. There is NO guarantee that you will have work, and when they do call you in, projects tend to shift and change with no warning. This means that you might show up to work, expecting a few weeks of income, only to be told that the project has been delayed. As projects get close to deadline, aforementioned poor planning manifests itself as last minute overtime requests, often on weekends.

Management is the main problem at Keywords. The top manager has often stated to me and others that his philosophy is: ""I don't care if people hate me, because no one is irreplaceable.""

This ""Leadership Style"" lays the foundation for how employees are treated, creating an often toxic atmosphere of intimidation and fear. The rest of the management team is typically overwhelmed and therefore mostly disinterested in the well-being of testers (to them, the priority is making Keywords look good to the client, not the employees). Don't expect anyone from management to be on top of communication, and don't expect to be thanked for your work.

Compensation is low for the work and what management expects from you in terms of availability and ""loyalty"". They pay people based on a combination of how rare the languages are, and how desperate they are for filling that seat. If your language is common (such as Spanish), you will be making an hourly rate in the teens. If your language is harder to find, you can squeeze them for much more. If you do apply to work there, it's important that you know your value and ask for a matching hourly rate - because you are not likely to get a raise after you start.

While I was there, there were several examples of people who asked for a raise and were made to wait months for an answer (I waited 5 months). If you do get a raise, you risk being moved to the bottom of the list - meaning if there is another tester covering the same language for less, they will call them in before you when there is work to do. Not surprisingly, this sometimes creates jealousy and mistrust between testers.

Outside of the pre-scheduled breaks, you are expected to quietly sit and work even if there is nothing to do. This happens regularly due to poor planning, but you are still supposed to give the appearance of working on something. Again, this is so it looks good to the client. There will be days, where all you do is sit and look at a spreadsheet and wait for an email to tick in.

There is a high turnover of people, as many leave as soon as they find something elsewhere. While there, I offered numerous suggestions for how this could be improved, but was eventually told that it was not a priority, just the nature of the business.

If you are looking for a career path, you can try to work your way from tester to test lead. That's as far as it goes, though. Be prepared to go above and beyond to make yourself stick out from the others who are trying to do the same thing. I did exactly that, taking initiatives and developing tools and processes for the benefit of everyone, on my own accord, some of which ended up becoming department standards. This sort of thing is expected from those who seek advancement. However, even if you do succeed in getting a promotion, know that a lead position comes with a ton more responsibility and expectation, but your compensation will stay pretty much the same as when you were testing.

There is no HR available, should you have a need for that."

In anything but the most unfavorable of job markets, you could definitely find something that pays more and afford more job security and growth should you stay in the job market. Anyone who isn't a bilingual 18-24 year old with zero experience should absolutely AVOID working here unless you're interested in derailing any career momentum you may have and stress over your own personal finances.

 If you DO happen to fit the demographic mentioned above than I would recommend working very diligently during the SUMMER months between E3 and holiday release time (after that there are hardly any projects/work so you'll be laid off) to build your resume and network a bit. If you're not going back to school or have something better lined up by October, you're going to get screwed - so plan ahead and don't be victimized by this company's deceitful practices like so many others who have already commented here have been in the past. 

Their testing processes are rather lax, allowing for too many errors to end up in released products and not creating an environment for individuals to develop into the best testers they could be. This company has also had at least one issue with unreleased content being LEAKED while being contracted for a well known company - maybe that's why they LOST that contract?? 

Work here at your own risk....and SHORT-TERM ONLY. Have an exit strategy mapped out on your very first day or you will definitely lose out and end up on unemployment waiting for the phone to ring."

You will be home MONTHS (not days and weeks like they say) before they call you back in, if they even call. They will not fire you because you could sue them, so they just keep lying and says that they will tell you if something comes  when there's no accountability and you're home without pay. 

-Dead end job. Sometime they say to be politically correct that the loyal, hardworking people will get hired fulltime or promoted. This rarely happened in the long time I was there (not even had ONE work review) and most of the smart, experienced people get jobs on better Microsoft teams or they go to Amazon (pays way more). Then you lose all of the best comrades.

-Testers are paid by language and not skill/experience. If you speak a more rare language, like Dutch or from Norway, you can ask for $20+ an hour but then they will just cut you after the project's over because they don't want to keep you around for that much. Spanish will pay a lot less but you do the same amount of work or more.

-People who pay there own rent can't afford to stay at this company. You will soon be forced to the streets looking for another job if you start here anyway. Why bother?? Just find a better job (and the main manager will tell this direct to you if you make a complain...he is a jerk who does not like the responsibility being the boss He secretly wants a demotion cuz' the company is quite bad)
