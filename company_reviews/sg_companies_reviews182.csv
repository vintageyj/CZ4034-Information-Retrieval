Fortinet,2.0,"Mar 4, 2024",Less than desirable,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,"Ken is a founder CEO and he’s built a world class company, products are fantastic.","Going through massive change at the moment and the current US Sales leader is completely unqualified to lead the team. He’s completely vacant from customer meetings, partner meetings, and his all hands calls are uninspiring. People are leaving in droves and the newly rolled out comp plan is accelerating this change. If you are considering a career at Fortinet demand the fine print before you sign."
Fortinet,3.0,"Feb 3, 2024",Rough Roads Ahead ,Channel Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","New York, NY",Overall well branded with a strong portfolio and Fabric strategy. Trying to pivot to address SASE and SecOps from a reliance on firewalls/network security. People on the sales side that were there the last several years have made some good money,"Lots of internal org changes including some leadership. Weak channel leadership and unnecessary internal channel conflict. Deal protection for partners is <10% , with vague rules of engagement that leave partners with little recourse and low profitability. Little in the way of formal career development or growth opportunities. In fact I didn’t even have a formal annual review in my tenure. Inspection and micromanagement has increased as growth has slowed. Giant marketing teams that hold the purse strings, with questionable measurable impact and understanding of the channel business needs."
Fortinet,3.0,"Jan 12, 2024",Disappointing,Business Development Representative (BDR),"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Sunnyvale, CA","- hiring team brought on plenty of competent and friendly people
- direct management was extremely supportive and encouraging
- good benefits
- encouraged to network within company if you wanted to move departments and given ample opportunity to hear from people outside of the sales org about their roles","- upper management out of touch
- amenities for employees were bare minimum
- unrealistic quotas were assigned every quarter
- training period was short and not thorough enough to cover all aspects of business development, such as channel
- VERY poor handling of wave of layoffs
- HR not helpful at all, HQ building security very condescending and unfriendly
- no provided or subsidized meals for employees"

What makes you feel you are working in a call center.
- There is not much time (actually 0 time) to invest in yourself to study or do anything besides work.

The best thing is the importance the Fortinet Team gives to the worker family which has an important role in my life. Also, Fortinet has given me the confidence to grow at my pace but encouraged me to try to be as valuable as the rest of the team. Last but not least, the managers (Theo and JC) are amazing and are always concerned about me and how I can perform better.",I don't have cons after this year.

-Room to grow","-Fortinet is the kind of company that will bring you from salary to hourly just to save a nickel. 
- ZERO company culture. Holiday party is the only event of the year that appreciates its employees and it is CANCELED 
-Commonly has jobs online, that are roles that have been frozen. 
-If you are employed with Fortinet- it's because they low balled you. If you are a female, you will be underpaid contrary to your male counterparts.
-They would rather hire someone with ZERO experience then pay someone what they are actually worth. 
-Your job is not secure unless you are working as 2-3 people. Many people have been fired."

The so called managers were all friends of the channel director and looking at their LinkedIn experience non had any managerial experience, nor technical expertise. The pay is a 50/50 structure base pay then commission based on the sales team you support and thats if they reach their sales goals so you won't make nearly what they make you think you you'll get. It is not consistent at all. There is no tuition reimbursement to help further your knowledge in the tech world. They say the others will help train, hahaha, that's if they can find the time. Training is a little batter these days but if your right out of college you'd think a company rhis big would have a robust training department. They don't. Which is amazing considering the industry they are in."

Fortinet,1.0,"Jan 14, 2024",Volatile Sales Teams - Revolving Door!,Major Account Manager,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Seattle, WA",Good sharp technical people and immediate management layer.,Terrible Executive Management who are not willing to invest in a vertical they know will take 12 to 18 months to win business. Expecting monthly revenue in a vertical that buys on bi-yearly or yearly budget cycles. Found out they have tried with 5 other Sakes Guys and continually “churn” year on year without adjusting the approach. Sales Teams are treated terribly. Technical teams are cherished. If you interview ask them the average length of their Sales Teams in a vertical vs. Technical Teams = if you don’t see a trend you are wearing a blindfold!
Fortinet,1.0,"Feb 16, 2024",Stay away unless desperate,TAC Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Prague,"It's a job
salary is always on time
30 days vacation","Very toxic management. It feels like totalitarian regime
People are not allowed to express their opinion or to bring up flaws. If they do, they are being silenced and marked as ""negative"". 
The managers keep introducing extremely annoying rules and changes, which almost never work. Bring additional pointless tasks all the time.
Sometimes they will introduce changes that seems only there to justify the existence of someone otherwise completely useless.

Company cost cutting a lot, removing bonuses, cutting everything they possibly can lately.

Lower tier managers are just pupets, they are afraid to question any decision or rules coming to them nor bring any flaws higher and try to hide any problems. There is no point to share anything to them as it just goes to a black hole.

The whole work organization is a complete chaos, no proper tiers, everyone doing everything. Senior employees annoyed by noob tasks, junior ones stuck with advanced tasks. 

80% of the job is a call center, answer random phone calls many times from annoying people asking you to ""do the needful"". Sure at the same time you have to do something more advanced and constantly be interrupted by those calls.

Progress is completely 0. If you want a promotion, make sure to become a puppet to the proper manager. Don't dare to question anything he says, especially on a team meeting.
Although it is questionable how much a ""promotion"" is worth it, since there are many cases where employees reject promotions because they are traps. 

Management name and introduce positions with fancy names like ""cybersecurity engineer"" just to be attractive but then you actually do call center work.

I am probably missing something, but the review will become way too long if I will be listing everything. Just stay away from this place unless you are desperate for some job, and especially if you are really skilled IT person."

Get to work with cutting edge technology sometimes. You can move around in the company but promote from within is declining. Unlimited PTO with your mangers approval is nice. Lots of product training.,"Depending on who your manager is will drastically influence your experience. Culture is declining and getting more severe. Focus on bottom line is being pushed harder and ruthless layoffs when profit isn't what the street expects makes people nervous. Unrealistic quotas (but that isn't really new). Mangement of quota payouts is *really* poor. The good, helpful, everybody wins culture is fading as external hires dilute it (more promotion from within would help keep it). Lots of managers dont know what they are doing because they are new. Trying to get help from experts on products has become nearly impossible and it was designed to be that way."
Fortinet,1.0,"Feb 7, 2024",Don't believe the hype (is a sequel),Technical Support Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 10 years","Vancouver, BC",Half decent pay but good medical benefits.,"While the company may have been touted as a top workplace, the reality doesn't match the hype. The atmosphere is toxic which leaves employees feeling constantly on edge. There's a lack of adequate training, leaving individuals to navigate their roles independently. Additionally, when profits dip, management may resort to questionable tactics to terminate or lay off employees solely to boost their bottom line."
