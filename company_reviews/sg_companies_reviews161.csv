Zoom Video Communications,2.0,"Feb 19, 2024",A Great Ship with a Lost Captain and Crew,Anon,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"Pros would be the culture before the layoffs, the ability for the company to create products quickly and masterfully.","Leadership. I believe this came from the pandemic elevating people who had no business being in senior roles being called to higher places of responsibilty due to the situation with the COVID boom. 

The emperor wears no clothes is another issue with the company. Eric needs people to tell him like it is and to assist in the growth of the company instead of a bunch of yes-men. 

Ironically communication, given it is a communication company. There needs to be more cross-pollentation of ideas amongst leadership. In person mandates for the drones isnt necessary and is in point of fact antithetical to the entire MO of the company, It is about leadership meeting and talking, for they decide the course of the whole operation, that needs to be done in person.

This company has potential to be great, but it is rotting from the inside due to leadership."
Zoom Video Communications,4.0,"Jan 31, 2024",Was great while it lasted,Security Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","San Jose, CA","Excellent compensation and benefits, unlimited (untracked) PTO, reimbursement for books and newspapers, some of the smartest people I've ever worked with, excellent CISO, opportunities to explore what interests you most and define your work.","Just as people were starting feel comfortable that the company was on a good trajectory, another round of layoffs hit, following recent assurances from CEO, Eric Yuan, that there would be no ""company-wide layoffs"" in the future. Not sure how widespread this recent round really is, but it comes out sounding like he was mincing words to hide the truth. Since growth has massively declined and the first large round of layoffs in early 2023, resources have been tight, making it hard to get work done. The focus has shifted from security being a top priority, to just building new features at maximum speed. While this is a hard balance to strike, it has made the job of security teams more difficult."
Zoom Video Communications,5.0,"Jan 14, 2024","Recognized Excellence, Family-Oriented Culture",Service Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"[Disclaimer, Zoom didn't pay me or influence me to write this review]
Zoom is an ideal workplace for those who are driven and appreciate recognition and rewards. My time here has been marked by multiple recognitions and promotions. Contrary to some other reviews, I find Zoom to be a company with top-notch employees, leadership—including Eric, Velchamy, and Mu—and exceptional products/services. Despite often working late and being on-call in my role, I'm still able to enjoy quality time with my family. The parental leave benefit has been a major plus for me, and I've utilized it twice. Remarkably, during my first parental leave, CEO Eric personally called to express his gratitude for my contributions, a gesture not commonly seen in other companies. My exposure to various technologies here has significantly enhanced my career growth. To me, Zoom feels like family, and I am deeply invested in its success.",I don't have any cons.
Zoom Video Communications,2.0,"Feb 29, 2024",Hit and Miss,Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","San Jose, CA","Good compensation, good company vision, great product. Stated culture is great.","Nearly impossible to climb to higher position. Very little support for new engineers. Lots of tacit engineering knowledge. Your job is to find out who knows what, because it is very likely not documented. If you go out of your way to help customers or improve yourself, you will likely be met with criticism that another part of your work was not completed. I enjoyed Zoom when I started, but it is no longer a fun or happy place to work. The culture is no longer there. It feels like endless work with no break."

Smita, CPO. She knows what she's doing, but no one else does ;(","I have never worked at a company where so many people are on stress/anxiety leave. Avoid this place like the plague. 

Its a fight at the top primarily among typical tech bros with any exceptions ""fired"" or ""part of a silent layoff"".  Its basically an Eric + bro ego culture with status quo prediction on all. Zoom employees that have been there a while, or new employees that represent the Eric +bro ego profile for management.

Zoom Video Communications,2.0,"Sep 5, 2023",Misguided and Misaligned,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","San Francisco, CA",The product is still great and continues to get better. Especially as an internal tool for employees.,"The company culture is terrible. People generally don’t seem to like giving or receiving it in a mature manner. Everyone is very adverse to any feedback (especially if critical). People also generally don’t understand their roles or the roles of others, which makes for really tense cross-functional partnerships. There is a lot of ego clashing. DEI is non-existent especially if you’re a person of color. A lot of micro and macro aggressions. They completely got rid of the head of DEI role and downsized that team, I’m not even sure if they have any influence at the company. Return to office policy roll out was a mess and absolutely impacted employee morale. The messaging of it also fell flat and felt disconnected from what the products do for people and what the company should stand for. Trust is at a low, but I haven’t exactly felt that since joining. Infrastructure is lacking internally, the systems and operations change often regardless of what you’re working on which makes the internal organization really haphazard. For a company that emphasizes care, they’ve been truly careless."

Many companies put profits before their people, but Zoom does so at the same time it claims to ""care"" for its employees. It is a toxic culture. Zoom was once a great place to work, but not anymore, at least not for those in support roles. Don't believe the positive press you might read about working at Zoom - the company does a masterful job of controlling the narrative outside its walls. It's an awful place to work and it seems to be getting worse."

Those redundant management hires are costing Zoom a lot of money without making much contribution due to their previous failures but CEO won't let go of them. That's probably one of the reasons why Zoom's layoff reflects almost nothing on the stock.
Zoom Video Communications,2.0,"Oct 2, 2023",Genuinely The Worst Company I've Ever Worked For,Enterprise Account Executive,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,My individual team was great. Misery loves company and we kept each other going during so many horrible times. The company was so clueless that a lot of times we just got to laugh together.,"As the title suggests, in my entire career, Zoom was without a doubt the single worst company I have ever worked for. The C-suite leadership clearly has no idea what they are doing. The company was never going to amount to much as of late 2021, but obviously the pandemic boom made it a household name where it never deserved to be as such. The market then expected growth to continue so leadership scrambled to create new products that are absolutely laughable compared to what's best in class in that segment. Webinar, chat, ZoomIQ (LOL), and anything outside of core meetings is a half-asses attempt at minimally viable product. Good luck if you're in sales and expected to put your own reputation and professional clout on the line representing these pathetic products out in the market."

Zoom Video Communications,1.0,"Jan 30, 2024",Titanic circling the drain....,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,Decent salaries/stock options (when they actually had a nice stock price),"Dictator CEO that pretends to care, but only wants people to say ""yes"" to whatever he wants - any disagreements get you pushed out
No strategy/vision - CEO only responds to whatever the wind blows in his ear that day/minute/etc. - it's constantly changing so who even knows what his grand plan is supposed to be
Terrible, horrible, no good managers that have NEVER led teams and NEVER worked in corporate environments and they favor those that remain silent and/or agree with them at all times
COO is a complete moron and only cares about how she looks on social media and her money - no clue how she was promoted to the level she's at, but she is incompetent and a liar about anything/everything she says - do not trust her or the CEO
Pretend culture of care, but then telling people to RTO or leave and then trying to back peddle on All Hands - let's make a product that is specifically designed for remote work and then not use it - yes, that makes tons of sense
None of the departments work together well so people are all over the place without any clear understanding of why they are doing the busy work they have been tasked with doing
Bloated in many areas but short-staffed in others - they actually cut the marketing team because the CEO believes he understand branding and marketing - check out that horrible playoff commercial if you need proof of his bad decision making in that area
Benefits have been completely stripped or wiped to the bare minimum so the only real thing they have is the salary and stock options, but I don't think that's holding most employees over as much as they think
So many lies from the leadership team and then they claim to have said something else when called out by the entire company - again, don't believe or trust any of them as they are self-centered and not self-aware"

Sad...,"Zoom used to be the greatest company to work for. Zoom even won multiple ""Best Places to Work"" and ""Best CEO"" awards in the past. 
Now, Zoom honestly doesn't seem to care about any of its 
employees.

Eric Yuan doesn't even seem happy anymore. His All-Hands meetings seem robotic and required, rather than energetic and emotional. 

Sales is an absolute mess. 
You have new Sales Managers who come in and blatantly lie to their reps, and encourage them to quit whenever they hit at any concerns or voice issues. They are more concerned about loyalties to their managers and careers than caring even slightly about their team or doing the right thing. 

You have Small Business AE's who sell Major's size accounts that are wildly out of segment, and then that rep gets praise and President's Club, while other reps who have had their territories 3 times in a year are told they don't work hard enough. 
When brought up to leadership, they tell you to stop complaining.

They continue to tell us we won't be doing more layoffs, but then secretly, what you hear instead is that many people are being put on incredibly aggressive and unattainable PIPs so that they can justify firing people for ""bad performance"" rather than saying they are doing more layoffs. 
When asked about this during company all-hands or meetings, they brush it off or ignore the question altogether. 

Zoom used to be a rocket ship but leadership (the remaining ones as the good ones seem to all be leaving or have already left) is making this rocket fall not just back to earth, but into the deep ocean."

Whenever I’d reach out to ask for work, he’d tell me to chill out, so I’d ask around my team to look for work & eventually I’d find it. - Closed work culture - Overall, bad leadership at all levels, fearful work environment & HR protects the company, not people"

This may have something to do with the market or something with the new leadership (maybe just an sad coincidence) - alignment of the books was unfair for most and favorable for few. Several people provided feedback to management, but they always got the cold shoulder. They would always say to control what you can control. Many top performers were selling to out of segment (way out of segment) - right after they did layoffs, they were hiring for the similar positions - the last year was the worst for employee morale - they went from such a great culture to not so great - no transparency in promotions - no specific path to help people get promoted - the new management wanted everyone to go to a 'yes, I will do that' mentality"

Zoom Video Communications,4.0,"Jun 8, 2023",Lipstick on a Hustle Culture Pig,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Denver, CO","- Decent pay and outstanding benefits - Friendly, fun, engaging culture & coworkers - High morale, lots of free Zoom swag, sense of community - Daily morning meetings, always starting your day on a great note! - Supportive, friendly, relatable, and accessible managers - Good structure, orderliness, and clear chain of command and resources for how to continually improve at your job/workflow - Fair vacation time policy - Clear path and encouragement to ascend up the ranks in your career - Great incentives (for commission-earning positions)","- Borderline unrealistically high expectations (for the Sales department) that, while all within legal compliance of ethics (which are methodically taught to new employees through mandatory online courses and quizzes to ensure written record of our understanding of legal boundaries for Sales efforts), are right up on that line of ethics with respect to how we prospect, book meetings, and close deals. There are oftentimes small or department-wide competitions to keep everyone constantly squeezing for more, and the prizes are seductive, incentivizing, and effective at their goal. Nothing inherently wrong with this, just that what gets sacrificed in all the sales reps (from the bottom tier to the top) vying for infinitely increasing accounts being onboarded is the prospects, the taste Zoom leaves in their mouths, and ultimately our brand image (in the eyes of those who've been on the receiving end of a prospecting campaign). - Another ""con"" is that Zoom is taken in with the woke ideology and seems to be vying for that ESG money (if they aren't receiving it already). Diversity hires are abundant, and the bi-weekly company-wide virtual meetings spend a significant portion of the meeting either highlighting the latest woke advocacy group that Zoom donated boatloads of money to, or reading employee-submitted Q&A questions, most of which relates to DEI, be it internal company matters, or sometimes public current events that Zoom had some ancillary role in. (This was especially relevant during the COVID lockdowns and the 2020 election season.) The money pits veneered with chartable optics seems to evade Zoom's upper management / executive board, or they simply don't care what the money is going toward (i.e., BLM) so long as the PR the company receives is good. And don't forget that ESG score. I personally didn't like that I was part of an organization that panders to the superficial games of grievance politics. If they were truly colorblind / genderblind / equal opportunity in their dealings, there would be no mention, let alone promotion, of these various grievance groups."
Zoom Video Communications,3.0,"Mar 21, 2023",It's fine.,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Denver, CO","The great managers are GREAT. The product has become a ""need to have"" in most industries, so you don't have to explain to people what Zoom does or how they could use it. The product innovation is unlike anywhere else I've worked. New features and products are released at lightening speed and for the most part, they are working well and successful from the get-go. The CEO, Eric Yuan, continues to be a great leader through challenging times.","Like a lot of companies, the managers and department leaders are hit or miss, and your experience can be night and day depending on which leader you have. Leaders don't have a formal evaluation process, so bad ones can sit in their role for a while and it's next to impossible to change teams unless you get a promotion to a new segment. Lay-offs in February 2023 were just the start of a lot of organization and compensation changes and cuts. You have to work a lot harder to make less. Also, Microsoft and Google have put on a lot of pressure and Zoom is fighting to stay competitive."

That said: Health Vision Dental 401k RSUs ""Unlimited"" PTO Career Guidance","The technical side is mostly run by a singular demographic that minimizes the opportunity for input if you aren't of said demographic. There's frequent (daily) language barriers due to this that make cooperation and authorization a black hole of uncertainty.

For majority of my experience at Zoom, the right leadership team was present to ensure our growth success. The vibe and energy was great and it made getting to work very fun.","As Zoom started to expanded into the cloud PBX and contact center market, it became more convoluted more difficult to navigate as a sales rep. Being accountable for oneself it the sales rep priority, but the team communication started to drop off. New leaders came aboard and shook up the whole vibe, in a negative way."
