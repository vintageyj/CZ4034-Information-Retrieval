You are encouraged to expand your knowledge and skillset through a variety of trainings, including certifications that will benefit you throughout your entire career.","None come to mind.

I have been working here 6+ years and don't see myself leaving anytime soon. Co-workers are amazing and Managers lookout for our Team members and promote great values and culture for our Teams. UKG cares about their employees, cares about their customers and awalys does the right thing. Very proud to work for this company. Our future is bright and so much growth ahead of us.","Our pay needs to be increased to follow inflation and cost of living increases. In all of my 6 years of working here we have NEVER gotten a Salary Adjustment to compensate for inflation and cost of living increases. This is not acceptable in a post 2020 world. 

Entry level pay at this company is still stuck 10 years in the past. AND our current yearly pay increases of 2-4% does not cover the difference in cost of living expenses. DO BETTER. 

Also! WFH fulltime needs to be an option for Employees whose team works at other locations or other states. There is no need to be in the office when all interactions with current team happens online - not in person. Hybrid schedule is NOT NECESSARY. Give employees option to work home at their own will and they will be happy campers AND save money on Rent at these corporate buildings. Expenses DOWN and Employee moral UP - WIN/WIN

Do not make in office days mandatory, let us make the choice!"
UKG,1.0,"Mar 4, 2024","Thinking of working for UKG, or using their services? Please read this.",Senior Data Analyst,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Weston, FL",Good benefits. That's it. Benefits.,"Thinking of working for UKG, or using their services? Please read this.
First, as you scroll through, notice something about these UKG reviews… the (many) negative one-star reviews tend to be long and full of detail, whereas the five-star “Great company!” reviews tend to be one-liners and worded the same, e.g. “None at this time” for negatives. See the pattern?
Don’t be fooled. Ignore the planted click-farm reviews and you’ll see UKG as the toxic company it has become.
I worked for Ultimate for over a decade and it was, by far, the greatest company I’d ever worked for. After the merger it became unbelievably toxic. Every really talented and enthusiastic person in my department—every single one—had either quit in disgust or been driven out. Be aware that management is outsourcing your code to India as fast as they can. 
Now, what if you’re a potential customer and you like the idea of your payroll provider being “lean and mean”? Know this: UKG’s Salesforce system shows a satisfaction rating for every customer: green and everything is good; yellow means the customer is upset, red means the customer is *really* angry and is actively planning to jump. In the Ultimate days to see even a single red was a rarity. Shortly before I got the hell out of UKG, I was assigned twelve projects, and out of the twelve *eleven* of them were red. Think about *that* when you’re recommending UKG to your boss."
UKG,2.0,"Feb 28, 2023",A Once Good Company Takes A Radical Turn,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 8 years",,The company benefits are outstanding.,"New leadership sucks: Chris Todd (CEO replaced Aron Ain) Hugo Sarrazin (EVP, Chief Product and Technology Officer) This company use to view employees as a top priority, and treat employees with compassion and empathy. Recently, all employees under Sarrazin, including those hired fully remote, or hybrid remote, were given 30-days notice before being required to begin working from the office or they would ""auto-resign"". They set the distance from the office at 50 miles! So, they honestly expect people to drive 100-miles per day. Some people have expressed concern with what would be a 90-minute commute, each way and the financial problems that would impact people who were hired to be fully remote. The official position of UKG was effectively: ""So what?"" In my opinion, the management of UKG is now focused on taking the company public, and to that end, they will step on as many necks as needed to cash out. My advice, don't be suckered by the previous reputation of Ultimate Software, Kronos, of the UKG. They are royally screwing over employees and Chris Todd actually said ""We know that for some people there will be a financial impact..."" FULL STOP."

Over the last few years this power of the organization has really taken a nose dive. Leadership is very out of touch and we have a new initiative every week it seems…many that clash with each other and all are give deadline with little to no guidance. So every team is doing their own thing and causing more issues. Oh and we are not allowed to let any scheduled work to slip. Very sad…used to work like a well oiled machine and now the burnout and frustration is at an all time high …but product leadership seems to think if we can’t take it good riddance.

While the organization has made strides in blending, there is still a clash of cultures between the work styles of the legacy employees. This is suffocating to the new employees and the politics at a leadership level can be insufferable. 
Over the last two years, there have been a series of layoffs across the organization that seem dissonant with the content coming out of Great Places to Work For, owned by UKG.
Transition back to the office has been forced and inconsiderate of positions remote prior to the pandemic, a sad example of how UKG is clearly no longer either of the companies it used to be."

UKG,5.0,"Feb 24, 2024",I hope to be at UKG for a long time,Marketing,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","Lowell, MA",Benefits are fantastic. People are really kind. Executives are accessible. The work is really interesting and I frequently have the opportunity to learn new things. UKG is constantly thinking about the HCM market and how customers can leverage what we are good at create great cultures where people want to work. I applaud how forward thinking UKG is.,"Some people don't understand what it means to work for a for profit business and complain/are suprised when difficult decisions are made.

If you want free health insurance this provides it but I imagine they will take that from us soon enough.,"Pre-merger Ultimate Software was an incredible company to work for. Kronos leadership came in and gutted everything positive. I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone work here until entirely new leadership is in place that proves to be better. The current decision makers are falsely inflating the company to impress shareholders. The reality is new customers are constantly angry with their experience. As employees we are trying to do our jobs with both hands tied behind our backs as they remove vital resources, withhold raises and bonuses, and employees are laid off in droves, or people just quit from the conditions. The company is essentially a skeleton crew of who is left. This went from the best job I ever had to the worst in the span of about a year, the competence and care of executive leadership is on the floor. They want to line their own pockets at the expense of the employees. 
Stay away if you care about your sanity."

If you're looking for more of a ""steady eddy"" job and workplace, then UKG probably isn't the place for you."
UKG,5.0,"Feb 28, 2024",Jump On In; the Water is Just Right  :-),Payroll Representative III,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Alpharetta, GA","There really is a pretty strong list of pros for working at UKG. When I started, I was making the switch from 13 years within the hotel industry. As much as I loved working in hotels, there were certain needs that were being neglected that I have found within UKG.
1) The work-life balance is awesome! Since joining UKG, I have worked under the leadership of four different managers. Never once have any of them made me feel guilty for having to take my children to the doctor, or attending one of their midday school functions. Thus far, my experience has been that as long as the job itself is getting done, there aren't any worries. They understand and acknowledge that we all have lives outside of the job, and they encourage us to make sure that that outside life is just as productive and healthy as our professional lives.
2) The lists of benefits that UKG offers to Ukrewers is amazing! In no particular order, and definitely not covering all of them: a) 100% covered medical and dental for you and your family b) unlimited PTO c) depending on your position, the ability to work from home d) Tuition reimbursement (which I am taking advantage of myself) e) their 401K match is insane as of right now. These are just a few, but I guarantee there are many more
3) If payroll is a new endeavor for you, like it was for me, please know that the Rising Stars program will give you everything you need to set you up for success in the industry. Beyond the Rising Stars program, UKG still offers great training options at any time.
4) Inclusivity: If there is anything about yourself that you feel people might wrongfully judge or condemn you over, don't worry about that when you come into UKG. There are various things about my own self that I've experienced negative backlash over within previous companies: my hair, clothes, facial hair, lingo and even the neighborhood I come from. Don't worry about experiencing that here. In fact, UKG offers and encourages Ukrewers to get involved with one or more of the various available ERGs that have developed. In these groups, we foster love and pride for those things that some in society would rather condemn and alienate.","There aren't too many cons that I can mention, and I promise that I am trying. My first is only a con depending on your point of view.
1) If you are new to the industry and company, the amount of things you must learn in what feels like short amount of time can seem overwhelming. Even managers who have been in payroll for years admit that they are still learning new things everyday. This industry comes with challenges and learning curves, and you have to be prepared to adjust to those. This requires an ability to focus on the task at hand, thoroughness in your work, and the humility to know when to ask for help. Once again, there are numerous trainings and resources to help you grow, and I haven't met one person who hasn't been willing to assist when needed. Your ability to overcome the challenges is completely in your hands.
2) I work in a Hybrid position which means we come in 3 days of the week, and stay home the other 2. The Payroll Representative position is one that can be done completely remote. On top of that, I have found that my most productive days are those where I do stay home, because I will work straight through the day. My office space is right next to the kitchen and bathroom, so I can get up and be back in two minutes. My children's school is less than 5 minutes from my house, so I can pick them up in 10-15 minutes. When I go into the office, it is between an hour and hour and thirty minutes drive there and back. I have to drop the kids off in the morning, and pick them up in the middle of the day. This is a lot of time I feel could be used towards productivity. Because of this, I find myself trying to schedule my worksite days to be the least busy. Outside of the issue of productivity, the office is beautiful and modern, and it's always great to get out of the house and truly work alongside my colleagues."

I've worked for very difficult leaders in the past, and it's a welcome change to have kind and supportive managers. They let employees shine and do the best work without micromanaging.

Each year your productivity goals increase by 20-25% while the pay stays stagnate. Expect 70-80 hour or more work weeks to reach the goals that are set. Ever since the merger there has been a relentless push to do more, more, more, faster, faster, faster. I joined this company because if it's reputation. Now we seem to be on a fast track to match the other ""Pay..."" companies instead of building on our strengths. It is a race to the bottom. Moral is down, people are exhausted and executive level mgt is out of touch. They gaslight you by repeating their ""purpose is people"" mantra but their actions do not match their words. There is nothing wrong with growth, efficiency, and streamlining things but, do it thoughtfully and effectively. Seems we are currently in the ""throw it on the wall and see what sticks"" mode."

This is not Ultimate Software, no matter what anyone tells you. There are many of us still here, but we have no power. Individuals hired as virtual on certain teams are now null and void so are required to come into the office, regardless of working 10+ years virtual with excellent reviews. We recently lost an employee that was a 11+ year critical resource due to this policy. It directly impacts the customer, but upper management did not consider an exception and then wonders why our customer satisfaction scores are dropping. Woke - they announced the race of our diversity VP before he was hired, which is against federal law. They also signed a letter against the FL Parental Rights Bill, just as Disney did.

UKG,2.0,"Jan 26, 2024",Final review of UKG,Manager,"Former Employee, more than 8 years",,"I have gone through 3 iterations of reviews on Glassdoor. First with Ultimate Software, which was a 5 star. Next was post merger and it was a 4 star. Now my final review since I have been gone an unspecified amount of time. Throughout these reviews, the Pros remain the same:

- Benefits are top tier (for now)
- 45% 401k match w/no limit is unheard of
- Co-workers were truly some of the best people I've ever worked with (excluding some I will mention later)","I will lead off with I have no ill will toward UKG and left under good terms. I left because I was stuck working 70 hours a week to keep up and my health started suffering.

I have never seen two top tier cultures with Ultimate Software and Kronos get destroyed so quickly. Kronos leadership effectively took over after the merge and quickly ignored suggestions from Ultimate leadership. Most of the Kronos leadership went to the same handful of business schools in the northeast and were all taught the same things and there was zero creativity in decision making or diversity of thought. Everyone in senior and executive leadership is in lock step with each other, because they are afraid to push back against their managers for fear of being fired. Being privy to meetings that involved senior and executive leadership, poor outcomes from poor decision making often leads to some poor director or VP being scapegoated and fired. This culture of fear trickles down and if you are a dissenting voice, your job is at risk.

Speaking of poor decision making, too many decisions are made without full understanding of the outcome. They laid off all of the customer relationship people, because ""on paper"" it looked like they did a job redundant to our support managers. However, no one actually bothered to ask what they actually did. I was in a meeting with a senior leader who flat out said they made a huge mistake with that decision. Internal process decisions have also been made without understanding the other side of the business. I won't give an example, because internal processes should remain internal. 

Also in many of these meetings, it is apparent that at least half of these leaders, if not more, whole heartedly believe that every front line employee is replaceable. That frontline engineer that designed and built a piece of the software and new all the ins and outs, who cares if we lay that person off, someone else can do that same job cheaper. That support person who has worked within the product for 7 years and knows it like the back of their hand, a kid fresh out of college can do that job with the same effectiveness for cheaper. There's a lot of smiles and false masks put on when they speak to front line employees, but I am absolutely disgusted by what some of them think about their employees. There are departments where this isn't an issue, but its mostly EPIC and support. They have internal surveys and every survey from the last two years, the lowest ratings are always about executive leadership. 

Just comment about benefits here. This past year it was announced that they could fund the 100% employer paid insurance for at least 2 more years. Insurance has gotten worse over the last few years, but I anticipate employees having to pay something after that 2 year mark. Salaries are lower than industry standard for many positions and benefits are keeping many people there."

To go from truly being one of the best companies I have ever worked for to one of the worst is an understatement. Leadership is being taken over by Kronos leaders and not all of them are bad but they all have an ADP feel and sadly, it is much worse than ADP ever was. When I was hired at Ultimate i was told they would never do lay offs. Well UKG has now done two rounds of layoffs and it is heartbreaking. They took away every perk imaginable and no one cares at all. This is one of the worse companies in my career but not because of what I went through at Ultimate, But what I have gone through as a UKG Employee.

Imagine having a manager with 11 years of experience with the company and all they have to show for it is incompetent leadership by forwarding issues to those under them. Why have Support Managers if they just use the same copy/paste templates on cases and send them off to a representative? Not to mention not checking cases, even upper management doesn’t do since “jUST cAlL tHe CuStOmEr aNd ClOsE tHe LoOp” will solve anything.

Calling every single customer will not resolve the issue. Me having to send another email from the case itself regarding a resolution/update does nothing but time waste. You managers have access to SF, use it for updates. I don’t have to send separate emails for every escalation when they have been notified on SF. Managers won’t even listen to you, they will repeat the same thing over and over for thirty minutes straight in each one-on-one meeting.

One goes to upper management for issues of how their managers grossly leads the team, two months later they are back at it again with the same actions.

This company cares more about the customer that you. United, Kind, and Growing, is a complete lie and a fraud. They will overwork you to the bone and set unrealistic numbers each month for production.

They don’t care about us, only to bend over backwards for incompetent customers who skipped every training and articles sent to them.

Toxic culture where many strong and employable people have left, leaving some behind who have no other option than to cling to their role by all means possible. The product has major issues as it is falling apart and barely working half the time. Epic exec leadership is in a tough position where they are trying to execute change but the staff won't or isnt't able to, which is causing their mandates from on high to be increasingly desperate.

The benefits at UKG are also quite generous. My favorite benefit is the UChoose benefit, where the company gives you $350 per quarter to spend on something productive, such as a pair of shoes, a new monitor, excercise equipment, student loans, and much, much more. My work is not tedious nor mundane and I am constantly exposed to new things that keep me engaged and learning more. The company also very much compares about your work/life balance and future professional life. Employees have free access to a wide variety of learning sites like LinkedIn Learning, Pluralsight, and a few more. Through these, you can study and take certifications (which UKG pays for) or just learn new skills you're interested in. I highly recommend UKG!","Since Kronos' merger with Ultimate Software, the business has morphed from a feel-good family business to more of a corporate giant. The company culture, while still very positive, has taken a hit because of their increased focus on money. Also, there has been layoffs recently which has cut a considerable portion of the company and there are concerns about job security. I also feel that some of the senior management (not necessary C suite) do not embody the company's culture of ""our purpose is people"" and are likely in it for the money."

UKG,5.0,"Jan 26, 2024",Start up vibe....with 70+ years of experience,Vice President of Sales,"Current Employee, more than 8 years",,"There's a whole lot to love at UKG. 

I've been in the HCM software industry for close to 25 years and 10 of those years have been with UKG. During that time I've seen the inner workings of lots of companies. What struck me 10 years ago when I joined Ultimate Software (the ""U"" in UKG) was how deeply everyone cared about our company, our customers and each other. When we were brought private via PE and later merged with Kronos (the K in UKG), I definitely had some reservations. Would the culture remain the same? Would people still care? Now that we're 3+ years post merger I'm so happy to say that nothing has changed, we're simply bigger, with even more to offer our employees and customers. 

The secret is the senior leaders. Everyone at UKG has the ability to have a relationship with the C suite and in my role as VP I'm fortunate enough to have quite a lot of exposure to them. They are the reason we continue to grow the product, perfect the service and take care of our people like family along the way. When the entire C Suite is in the same boat rowing the same way it's easy to to be excited as an employee and especially as a leader. They communicate well with me and I can communicate well with my team. They know where we are, where we're going and give us everything we need to do our jobs and create great relationships internally as well as externally. They treat us ALL like family andf that means a lot to me.

That said, by far my favorite part of working at UKG is when the following situation happens (which it does frequently): I'm in public with my UKG golf shirt on and someone says ""do you work for UKG?"". In past roles outside of UKG that question would make me nervous and maybe even a little ashamed. Now that I'm here at UKG I have no nerves becuase I know what is comming when I say ""yes...I work at UKG"". Without question the person will respond with something like ""we use UKG and I love it"" then the person pulls out their mobile phone to show me the app my team sells that they use every day. Other common responses are ""I've always wanted to work there..."" or ""my friend works there and loves it...do you know ______?"". The common theme is that the responses are always positive and always make me proud of what I do for a living.

If you want to go to bed feeling good about what you do...UKG is a great place for you!","Depending on who you are as a person and what you like, I guess you could say there's a lot of work to do here and everyone is very busy. For me, I actually like that but I can appreciate not all people are wired like me and want such a fast pace. It feels very much like a startup here, even though it's a very mature and well established company. For me, I welcome the challenge...my days go by fast and I never get bored. Again, some folks may like a slower pace and less work but to me...that would be like sitting in detention (not that I would know....well...maybe)...I say bring on the work and fast pace...lets go do something amazing with your career!"

The leadership is not good. Decisions from leadership are secretive, and never in the favor of the employee. They have a ""good ol boys club"" and if you are not in it, they truly dont care about you as a person, just a means to an end. They hack away at our compensation plan every year, like Pual Bunyan trying to prove their might. The company is not financially healthy. They talk about the ""rule of 40"" and how they are upside down on that figure. There are too few accounts to go around and too many reps. They have fired over 1,000 employees in the last 6-8 months with zero empathy. They used to be about the employee but that ship has sailed. The grass is not greener at UKG, it is wilted and brown.

You will have to play politics. Employee upskilling and lateral movements within the company were difficult to attain. Once again, could be due to your relationship with your manager. Manager may or may not be proactive in helping you advance in your career. You will probably have to fight for opportunities to learn more and do more elsewhere.
