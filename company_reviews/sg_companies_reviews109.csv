That's it.,"- All of the team leads are a bunch of snakes. All of my monthly reviews with my team lead were nothing but positive and I was still let go. It didn't make any sense! -They would rather pick and choose their favorites and promote them rather than give raises to the employees that are actually hard working and care about their job position. (I wasn't the only one let go on the same day.) -You're given way more job responsibilities without a choice that are out of the job description you applied for and there is no compensation given. -If you think for a second that you have a life outside of work, please don't. To them, you don't have a life outside of work. -You have NO privacy. So what they say online about remote jobs being monitored is 100% true. -All of the above - have been instructions given by a company that are contracted with ICS (Deloitte) but ICS was not supposed to be on the contract in the first place (per Loyal Source Governemt Solutions) so they just went with it like a puppet and couldn't argue. -ICS is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau."

Maybe only one pro was the client was a big company and was utilising the latest technologies in the software realm.,"They have a shady way of how they operate, right from the hiring till the exit. Being an international student and working in the US, there are a lot of challenges with respect to employment and visa status . Infinite hired at a yearly salary in the range of $55,000-$60,000. The work with the client was very hectic as the bar set by Infinite to Client is very high and the employees were severely underpaid. This same line of work gets you atleast 85k-90k annually in the specified location. They offer sponsorship which is a great option for International students, but the horrible part was, they didn’t want to pay the minimum wage as per the LCA because it was a significant increase from what they were paying and instead asked the employees to relocate to remote counties/states on a 2 day notice as the LCA minimum pay for those areas is less and didn’t care if the employees had to commute 3hrs for work daily due to their demand of relocation . Also had some of my ex- colleagues getting fired in the midst of their H1-B filing as they had too increase their pay too. The communication of firing was given on literally the same day just 2 hours before the End of the business day. On asking the reason, the managers redirected to HR’s and Senior HR who ghosted and didn’t respond and started the blame game. No relieving letter and no communication whatsoever, just a minute call and an email to ask for the return of the laptop. They Don’t match 401k, have a pathetic insurance provider and overcharge on the deductions for these so called benefits. Unprofessional management to the core."

Unwilling to let you submit your time card prior to the last day so if you're out of the office, you are still required to login. Refuses to include state tax forms as part of onboarding process. Will not offer a paper check option. Invoicing of client projects regularly does not happen despite a complete and transparent billing process so employees relying on that as part of compensation are left without commission. No maternity leave, no 401k match, but company has the capital to acquire and dismantle other products. Broken promises from day 1, from the simple promise of a 'welcome goody package' that was never delivered to a promise of growing the product but instead offshoring it.

Infinite Computer Solutions,5.0,"Mar 26, 2021",Customer Service Representative on IBM Contract with NY DOL,Customer Service Representative,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Rockville, MD","Working from home as an asset for Infinite Computer Solutions has been a great opportunity to earn money and stay safe from Covid19. This has been an unusual year 2020-2021 to say the least, so working from home lessens the disease risk. Also, I am able to watch my kids while they do school from home as well.","The blessing of working from home is also its own curse: you have to convince yourself you are ""at work"", so I still show and dress the part to get into the mindset. Also working from home answering the phone requires a quiet work space that is difficult to achieve. (Use a microphone that blocks noise that isn't near the microphone)."

Infinite Computer Solutions,1.0,"Jun 18, 2018",Worst contracting agency on the planet. Just say NO Thanks.,Computer Lab Technician,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","San Ramon, CA",Not a single positive thing can be said of these people.,"First they lied to me to get me to accept the position. It was never a ""contract to hire"". Second they screwed me over when I became eligible for company benefits and made me wait another 6 months. Third, they tried six or seven times to demand that I allow them to rip up my contract so they could cut my pay. Finally I was told today that my job had ended, only nobody from Infinite ever bothered to email or call me about this. I am unemployed and not one of those morons bothered to let me know. It is their job as my employer. They have known for days. Nobody has written or called me to say I was done, or thanks for all your work, or even screw you. Absolutely the worst agency I have ever had the displeasure to work for. You are not a person to them, just money and a number."
Infinite Computer Solutions,1.0,"Jul 11, 2018",Software Tester,QA Tester,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"None - zero - you're a warm body adding to their bottom line - that's it. Never heard from them after signing the initial paperwork, which took over two weeks for the background checks and alike, due to some pretty incompetent office staff.  Every day they would call to get one more piece of data - hey guys - ever hear of a checklist?  Everyone there in the hiring office seems fresh off the boat from Bangalore.","They zap you an extra $105 dollars every pay period for your benefits on top of the premium you have to pay. And they went out of their way to sign employees up for every type of insurance known to man, just so they could make money off of it.  
These people also used real payroll data from real employees/contractors to perform some internal software tesing, and that data got stolen.  So they had to pay for 2 years of fraud monitoring for their employees."
