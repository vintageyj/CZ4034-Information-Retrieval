Pactera,2.0,"Sep 24, 2017",A Charade,Test Operator,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Vancouver, WA","Building has good amenities, work is exceptionally easy. Company funds monthly workplace celebrations.","Very poor management on the Technician level. There are a select few who work hard and are generally likeable, but the rest sit on their computer all day and give assistance only begrudgingly. There is a high level of incompetence in the Technician level. Several times I have been able to answer more technical questions as an Operator than the Technician was able. Essentially, a hierarchy based not on merit was established shortly after 2015 when the team was put together. Many of these people have horrible attitudes, are incompetent for the job (not even saying they are dumb, just simply not fit for the job), and resistant to doing any actual work. The management receives zero input from employees based on staffing, there is zero penalty for careless or lazy conduct (a few Technicians arrive late to work every single day with no consequences), and there is zero employee review. The company image is being tarnished by a few of these individuals to the point that our client has specifically named some of them. 

This dynamic leads to those who have true talent being stuck at operator or low level technician level, where they are hindered from any real positive effect on the company, and the incompetent people filling the upper roles."

Many workers eat at their desk and do not take breaks. 
Workers hours/minutes per task are measured way more closely that needed. It is possible that the only way to get your 8 hours per day is to work through your breaks.
Pay is very low for the level of work that you are doing, and basically no raises. This is probably because they figure they can get someone to do the job (if they did not hire you). And they know that there is some ""draw"" for workers who are willing to work for low salary if they know they are working as a vendor for a large IT company.
No guarantee that you will keep your job even if you are full time. You could be laid off at any time, and especially if the Vendor does not renew their contract with Pactera."

Management is laughably incompetent, which is weird when you consider that's like half the people who work here. The people who negotiate contracts might as well be an inanimate object for as effective as they are. The people who actually do the work we're contracted to do keep having their productivity requirements raised, without a raise in pay, so they can keep paying their bloated management, and they're surprised when half the team quits every other month.

I was not told who I was interviewing with, or for what company I would be contracting for. The job offer was rushed and did not allow for any discussion on the benefits, work hours, details. There was NO room for salary negotiation. Now that I work here I am still unsure who my boss is. I have had no reviews or meetings discussing my performance.  Everyone speaks Chinese which creates a disconnect in the office. The on boarding was unprofessional- they were late to the first two days of training, never gave us a tour of the facilities, explained when we were expected to arrive, I had to ask many questions because nothing was explained. Pay is maddeningly low- it is obvious they are a billion dollar company because of the way they pay their workers.  I feel like another robot working for the company.

-The management (almost exclusively imported from China) may at times have a language barrier with the employees who are mostly locals
-From personal experience, almost all upper-level managers were overburdened with stringent work demands. Many such managers, including our own, eventually resigned in protest due to the amount of work and returned to China. The high level of turnover in management contributed to the general disorganization in the company itself
-The management was generally disorganized, perhaps due to the above-mentioned high workload and demands. Some managers confided to me that they were receiving less than 4 hours of sleep per night having to deal with many requests from Beijing. This general disorganization meant that workers sometimes had to deal with conflicting information from different managers, including their project managers. This at times led to sanctions and write-ups against certain employees.
-The hiring requirements as well as the pay grade for Relevancy Judges at Pactera were not very stringent, resulting in some interesting personalities being employed at our office. Although we had no issue being around and interacting with such employees at a personal level, the emotional instability that some of these employees suffered from caused tensions in the office to rise, especially with regards to perceived threats and paranoia.

Parking: Every day, you will have to go up to reception and ask for a parking pass to place in your car and then return at the end of the day.

Working Environment:
For the most part you will be in the open area in a shared desk, but some teams are contained inside small rooms, with surveillance cameras to monitor you.

Major Cons:
I noticed there is high turn over here. Many people quit within a matter of a few months or less.

I already had a big first red flag during my interview, when I went in for an interview and they did not know that I was supposed to be there, even though the email specified a time and a date to come in, which I was blamed for afterwards for coming in without an ""official"" invite and was then told to wait for two hours before being seen and then after was rushed through an interview.

There's a lot of finger pointing here, and I felt I was consistently criticized for every single ""mistake"" I made, which sometimes they were not mistakes but new rules made that don't reflect on the work you did in the past that were correct in that time and none of your work is ever appreciated nor is good work appreciated. When I first started, I was told by management how to do things a certain way. Then they changed how they wanted to do it later, and then when the higher ups did not approve of the work the way that we were taught to do it, we were blamed for making many ""mistakes"" even though that was how we learned how to do it. If they change the rules and don't like it, you will be blamed first.

I was constantly harassed and picked on during multiple team meetings, where management would specifically ridicule me in front of everyone saying that my work was bad, when it was the responsibility of everyone and not just me, and I felt targeted personally. My name was mentioned many times in front of everyone and other times I was pointed out like ""YOU made that mistake"" pointing at me or so on, which I felt was not professional in any way. I believe private matters should be handled apart from team meetings, or if there is an announcement to make to everyone it should be in regards to the whole team rather than targeting an individual.

I also felt that many people made comments and assumptions about me due to my race, and I was often asked about my race which I felt was inappropriate in a work environment.

Management also treats coworkers unequally and management mentioned she wanted someone else to review my work because she trusts her more than me (in front of me) and I felt like I have been putting in my hard work and treated poorly, more so than my coworkers so the management gives impartial treatment to all of the people on the team.

Management does not keep track of what work they have assigned to you, and keeps giving out more and more work for you to do without realizing what has been completed and will accuse you of not completing the work when realizing the amount they sent you was more than others.

I was also asked to do unpaid work and training at home and they insisted on doing unpaid work at home, which doesn't seem right especially as an hourly paid employee. When I tried to ask if I can work on it in office, they avoided answering completely. It often feels that they do not respect your time outside of work nor at work nor you as a person.

Some teams will let you work remotely/at home, but some due to privacy reasons will require you to work on site, with all your belongings locked up.

Very unorganized workplace, with no one knowing anything and no one knowing who does or did what and this company gave out the impression that they do not care about their employees at all.

Not worth the low pay and stress in my opinion. 

Overall worst job I ever had and felt devalued as a human being and employee here. 

If you can, do not work here!"
Pactera,1.0,"Jul 10, 2017",Everything was just a mess,Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"My in-office coworkers were (mostly) really lovely people who did their best to help me when upper management couldn't or wouldn't be there to assist me. I actually liked a lot of the work, was very good at it, and enjoyed being considered an expert in certain aspects of my job due to my relative seniority in the department. My work schedule was totally flexible and I could adjust as needed for traffic or other anomalies in a given day. When I had ongoing health issues one summer, I was allowed to take unpaid time to recover. I was promoted after only nine months and given what seemed at the time like a significant raise (more on that in the cons section), and I did gain experience in team management early in my career that I am grateful for. Most of my subordinates were wonderful people who I enjoyed working with and I am grateful for their patience despite my inexperience in management. I had decent health insurance, and was able to add my wife onto my benefits with no issues. I was able to work from home pretty much whenever I wanted, which was convenient. No one cared what I wore, so my wardrobe was extremely casual. Also, I got so good at my job that I was able to get work done while doing background reading and writing.","First of all, Google ""Stevenson v. Pactera"" - I was one of the team members affected by this incident, and while I appreciate the settlement check, I can't stress enough how shady it was to have us as 1099 contractors to avoid paying benefits. We were converted to W2 employees fairly soon after I was hired, but I know that some of the others had been there for many months before that happened. Also, I was originally stationed in a satellite office, and eventually when the team dwindled to a handful of people we were shoved into a tiny back room and expected to work despite ongoing loud noise from the team who took over our old office (the walls were thin). This back room was mostly windows, which meant that during the summer months it became almost unbearably hot, and we couldn't open the windows or have fans because the ambient noise would have affected our ability to do our jobs. I'm fairly sure I could have reported the company for inhumane working conditions or something similar (I was wearing a T-shirt and thin pants and still leaving the office drenched in sweat every day), but I was terrified of being fired and suspected nothing would be done even if I did say something.

Once I was promoted to a management position and moved to the main area office, I hoped things would improve, which in some ways they did. I received a small raise with the promotion...which I later found out was 70% of what the person who had previously held my position (a man) had been making, as well as hilariously under market rate and barely above minimum wage. I never got any more raises, even though I was (as mentioned) very good at my job and the only person in office who remembered several processes that had become outdated while I worked here (but which I was expected to remember and use if asked). When I asked for a raise and presented evidence that I was being severely underpaid, I was strung along for awhile and then told that no one in the company had received raises in the last year.

I also received no sick pay, vacation, or holiday pay. I continued to be listed in the system as a lower-level/contract employee and no one noticed despite my having been in a managerial position for a year and a half. No one ever bothered to explain to me how any of these worked, or whether I was in fact supposed to be getting them at all. I swear that once I entered in holiday hours and they were accepted, but I tried this on the last federal holiday before I left the company and was informed a few days later that I did not qualify for holiday pay and would have to remove those hours from the system. I have since been told that asking employees not to come in AND not to be paid for missing a federal holiday is unusual, especially for a full-time management position. On my last day, I waited until the end of the day to log my hours in the system and found myself totally locked out. (I believe this was resolved, as my final paycheck was the appropriate amount, but at the time it was distressing as I did work the entire day.)

I worked on either the in-office desktop computer, or a personal laptop that I purchased to use when I was working from home. At no point was I given a company laptop, and my repeated attempts to ask my managers for help acquiring one were shrugged off. I could have pushed harder for one, but by the time I realized that not having one was unusual (several months into my management position), I had begun to realize that almost no one in the office was interested in making sure I had the tools I needed. I also, somehow, was the only employee in the office who didn't get a proper badge - I may have been out sick that day but I continued to use the same keycard that I'd been given on my move-in day and no one ever bothered to check up on that. After the fact, one of my coworkers pointed out that without the official badge, I could easily have been locked out had my old keycard been disabled on a whim. Was there not a record of my keycard being “missing”? That seems like a ridiculous security risk to me.

Upper management was frequently either absent or difficult to reach – the person who was meant to be my ""manager"" was in-office maybe one day a week and didn't often respond to emails or messages. I had several other people who acted as managers to me, but while they did their best to help, they frequently left or were moved to another team within a few months, leaving me without guidance once again. I worked with overseas management more frequently, especially in the last year or so of my employment. I hold no grudges against them, but they had a tendency to prioritize ridiculous client demands and company policies over the reality of certain situations, and repeated many of the same talking points when I tried to push back. I was given zero management training and very little guidance and mostly left to my own devices in these respects. (Frankly, if my job had been taken by someone less conscientious, this department could have descended into chaos much sooner.)

I had repeated conflicts with several subordinates, in multiple cases receiving messages and emails with abusive language regarding both myself and the company. I never felt truly unsafe, but rarely was I given assistance in handling these issues. I always tried to argue in the best interests of my team, but was frequently overruled or ignored. I felt pressure both from the team to voice their concerns to upper management, and from upper management to deliver the (frequently) bad news about new policies or procedural changes. I did not get the sense that I had any real power at all in the situation.

My job required that I have a reasonably quiet environment; however, I was forced to move desks several times within a year and each time I found the ambient noise more disruptive to my work. At first I was placed in the same open office as a large team who would sometimes chat with each other and occasionally get rowdy, but were mostly quiet; I then moved to a smaller room where several employees had desk phones and were answering them multiple times a day. Finally, I ended up in the middle of another open office, at a desk that was very close to the employee break room, which had no door and no way of muffling the sound from within. Employees frequently went in there to play pool, chat, take phone calls, and even play video games throughout the workday. I understand some of these things will happen, but the noises from the video games and pool actively impeded my ability to do my job. It was literally the only room in the office without a door and I still don’t understand that architectural decision. 

I became so stressed due to the low wages and absurd job expectations that I developed a variety of health issues in the last few months I worked there, including a stomach ulcer and ongoing chest pains caused by anxiety that lasted for several days. In the case of the latter, I was in such pain that I was unable to sleep properly and had to go to the ER in the middle of the night. I believe this job impacted my health significantly."
