Uber,5.0,"Jan 6, 2016",An amazing and inspiring place to work,Operations and Logistics Manager,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Chicago, IL","I love being able to work around truly passionate people who are ready to change the world. The culture is great, free snacks and food is big plus. I had the opportunity to take ownership of projects within my first month","The hours are much longer than any other job I've worked in, but this is expected to change as we continue hiring more help"
Uber,4.0,"Feb 17, 2024","Good Salary, Friendly People, Weak Management",Senior Software Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Seattle, WA","The salary is top notch, even in the tech industry. Uber in the past has had a reputation for being an incredibly toxic place to work at. From what I've understand, they've undergone a transformation with the current CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. I've been here for 2+ years and I have not experienced that at all. All the people I've worked with are respectful. The work life balance is also quite good. I typically do not have to work more than 40h, except for on-call or an occasional deadline.","Uber has started to track diff count and other metrics for worker productivity, and it is an input to performance discussions. I often see diffs that are committed without testing or unnecessarily broken down just to meet quota requirements. It hurts quality without materially improving true productivity in my opinion.

I also feel like management is quite weak. My managers are all just people managers, assigning work to engineers and attending meetings. I don't see ownership in them to drive culture or engineering efficiency or product strategy. That stuff is pushed down to the engineers who are busy in the weeds. As a result, I see tons of examples of poor engineering design, incidents that happen due to lack of testing, and so on."
Uber,4.0,"Feb 25, 2024","Overall, I would recommend Uber",Recruiter,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","New York, NY","I have worked in different departments (the CEO in customer support and in TA as a recruiter) and can honestly say the people and culture was great in both orgs. Overall, some of the best people I have ever had the pleasure of working with in regards to not only my peers, but management as well.","I really don't have too many cons. I will say that I did not like how the layoffs were handled in June of 2023. For the longest time Uber employees were told not to fear about layoffs in 2023 in Talent Acquisition. While I understand these things happen, if there was any doubt that this was no longer true, a warning would have been appreciated. I spent 4 years at Uber and grew and learned so much. I felt that the company invested in me and I committed myself to do the same. I had every intention of staying at Uber. It is a shame that Uber let go of way too many talented people. Only allowing a month to find another role within the company was not enough time and the severance package was okay, but not great."
Uber,5.0,"Mar 4, 2024",Best Company To Work For,Sr Credit Risk Analyst,Current Employee,,"Uber cares about their employees. Their hybrid work schedule ensures you spend 50% of your time working remotely from the location of your choice.

Though I do wish I had two computer screens to use while in the office. lol"

Uber,1.0,"Jan 18, 2024",Horrible,Ride Share Driver,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,Convenience is the only pro,"Uber lies, cheats, and steals from riders and drivers. The pay is horrible, and they continue to make it worse. They do not care about drivers at all, because there is always some poor sap who thinks they can make a little extra money. I suppose if you only drive 100 miles a week which translates to maybe 90.00, then you still have to pay for the gas. It might be ok to make a few extra dollars, but that’s about it. Your car will be ruined if you drive regularly, and you won’t make enough to replace the car. Every year you drive you will have a tax loss, which can be beneficial. However, at the same time it shows how it is a losing proposition. It is unsustainable, unless you’re prepared to buy a new car every couple of years. I do know that in a few large cities there is more chance to make money. However, if you’re not making what you need, with an additional amount to save for a new car then you’re going backwards."

Uber,1.0,"Jan 21, 2024",Run!!,HR Specialist,Current Employee,"Sunnyvale, CA","The benefits are excellent, and the people are great, except for the leadership. When I first joined, the leadership was actively involved and there was more transparency within the department.","Middle management exhibits disrespect and a significant ego. Leaders avoid taking on challenging tasks and improving processes, choosing instead to position themselves as heroes by implementing systems learned during their MBA studies at a third-tier school. Career progression is lacking, goals are unrealistic, there's consistent deception, layoffs occur, and there are insufficient tools and resources. The primary reasons people remain in my department are the favorable pay and benefits, and more significantly, the current state of the job market. However, once the job market improves, there will likely be a line at the door as people seek to leave."
Uber,3.0,"Mar 7, 2024",Uber Freight is not Uber,Software Engineer,Current Employee,"San Francisco, CA","Uber Freight does probably pay better than your average tech company, but it is not Uber.","Poor leadership.

I love the feeling of independence. The newer features allow filters by area and destination. Would recommend as a side hustle only.,"Do not rent from Uber. I paid $425/week during the winter and business had died, but Uber/Hertz doesn't care. When I received my final bill there was an extra $600 charge. Being platinum level brought higher paying trips, but starting at the bottom is lower pay. Uber customer support is a joke and does not care about driver safety (only about how they look). A scammer called posing as Uber support and wanted to confirm my vehicle, appearance, and how I greet passengers. I hung up and called Uber directly, but all they cared about was if they had my payout info, not that they were trying to identify me (a female driver). They said they put in extra securities to protect my money, but they didn't. Disgusted with the company itself, grateful for the summer pay (~$35/hr) though the winter pay (~$14/hr) hurts if you're unprepared/unaware."

Great sales leadership, great pay and commissions, all the amazing benefits of UBER: great health insurance, wellness stipend, Uber perks, equity, ESPP program, etc. Then Uber Freight acquired Transplace Logistics and split from Uber…","After the acquisition of Transplace Logistics and after UF separated from Uber things started to go down hill. Loss of benefits and perks, crazy management changes, commission structure changes. I guess that while under Uber, UF was ok bleeding money — as many startups do. But no more. Layoffs. Sales employees terminated after one bad quarter. Im sure more to come as the actual merging of the two companies slowly continues on. Seems like a lot is up in the air right now and I wouldn’t join the company today with so much uncertainty about where it is going in the future. No career path or growth for employees in sales and account management. Unlimited PTO but don’t take too much time off as an acquisition sales rep or you will never meet your quota."

Work is independent, there's no real overhead to report to (this can be a double edged blade at times).
In my experience, customers have been very polite. I've had maybe three instances of dealing with someone difficult in my years of driving.
Company hires people of many backgrounds.","Inconsistent pay.
Use of personal vehicle means high maintenance expenses. This also makes the job less viable as full time work, I would only recommend someone take this on as supplemental income to another job or as a short term solutions in between jobs.
Long hours can be tiring, which can lead to safety concerns.
Helpful benefits require more time put in, and can be easily lost if your monthly tier requirement is not met; even then most aren't very useful.
There is a slight language barrier with the outsourced support team which can make it difficult to properly explain and resolve issues; which also eats at time and can result in poor earnings for the hour.
Opportunities to make extra income during certain time frames have shifted to opt-in and are easy to miss.
Having to cancel an order due to circumstances outside of your control (e.g. early closure) will temporarily reflect negatively on your profile. These will often be reported several times before the order is actually canceled."

- You receive Uber Credits every month
- They are hybrid and provide free lunch in office","- Our hourly rate does not equate to the work load that Uber throws at us 
- Organization is very disorganized (For a tech company they still are stuck in 2015 with their processes and are unwilling to automate/update processes to be current with standards and practices 
- Hold benefits over your head when you bring up concerns
- In application and entire training process make calls seem minimal but once you are fully onboarded they throw you on multiple call campaigns every week without proper training and expect extremely unrealistic calls per hour and quality assurance without providing useful resources.
- DO NOT JOIN SPOT IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE THE GUINEA PIG OF UBER !! (We test out processes and are the team that have to create processes for new assignments and because of that again there’s no standards to follow but somehow we are held at extremely high expectations! 
- Little room for growth due to favoritism/kissing up. If you are a hard worker but are not involved with their additional clubs they are less likely to promote you.

Like with many big companies, there is more work to be done than can get done. This is generally a good thing. It helps to stay engaged and to continually grow. The problem is when things try to move too fast and timelines, quality standards, and boundaries aren't managed correctly. Communicate well and it's overall a good situation.","Sometimes projects and initiatives try to move too fast and it comes at the cost of code quality and incidents. This isn't uncommon so just try to manage it, that's part of job anyway. I personally don't have an issue with the 50% RTO policy and code diff expectations. Some people do.
