Sprinklr,2.0,"Dec 15, 2023",Absolutely Atrocious Sales Management,Enterprise Account Executive,Former Employee,"Denver, CO",Co-Workers were great people and talented sales reps,"- Culture of micromanagement. Sales management at Sprinklr has no idea how to run a proper sales organization and they try to make up for it by attempting to control every aspect of the sales cycle. This in turn creates a massive bottle neck where reps do not have their own autonomy and require management involvement to simply call a customer. Your manager will want to be on every call, every email, maintain access to your call notes and will want them all in the format of their choosing; which they will change on a whim.

- 95% of reps here will not make any money. The quotas are set high and the territory is thin. Most people make their base salary.

- The company grew quickly due to a low rate environment and went public. Due to this they have people who were SDRs when it was a startup, who are now attempting to manage seasoned sales reps. This leads to insecurity in management, who will tear down their reps to avoid the perception of inexperience.

- The company doesn't know what it wants to be. Although public, the company can't decide if it's a marketing tool, a customer care tool, or an advertising platform. All of Sprinklr's competitors have decided what they are and cost less. The product is not a need to have for most companies.

- Culture of playing favorites. Managers frequently pick and choose who gets which accounts based on who they like. Promotions are also decided this way."

I have worked at Sprinklr for 7 years, and experienced the organization as both a Startup and Public company. Watching Sprinklr try, fall, get up, grow, and win over the years has truly been an unforgettable experience.

Ive kept up on LI with former colleagues and in my department roughly 50% of people have moved on sooner than a year which I think is telling.

The CEO is a great visionary but he lacks trust in his senior leadership team and begins to take over their jobs and responsibilities. The CMO position has been open for more than a year, the previous marketing leadership teams have tried to push back on Ragy in order to do their job, be the experts they were hired to be, and often get pushed out."
Sprinklr,4.0,"Sep 25, 2022",Overall Great - Few Key Areas Need Improvement,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Austin, TX","Base salary is very competitive in tech sales (Austin based) - variable comp is less than some of the %'s I've seen elsewhere, but higher base comp is always preferable in my opinion to account for the ups and downs of B2B sales.

Most amazing product ever - incredibly impactful on the market. The opportunity to sell to the literal biggest brands on planet Earth is very fun. This comes with a need for strategic, highly personalized outreach that is a very cool challenge to approach every day.

Lots of PG freedom, as long as your numbers are decent and you're putting in effort, the channel and method of outreach are always flexible, SDRs are mostly allowed to do what works for us. Now if you're struggling that becomes a different story, but that is the way of sales everywhere.

Very supportive community - since SDRs have their own territory and specified accounts to work on, there is a minimal amount of strategy guarding or gatekeeping. For the most part, everyone wants to help each other out, all managers are very willing to help people from other teams with whatever is needed.

Incredible office space that is under-utilized. If you get a job as an SDR here (which I recommend) use the office space! Free lunch 2 days per week, tons of snacks/drinks on site, many many desk spaces which are never full, game room, weight room / locker room, a bunch of soundproof call boxes / meeting rooms, etc. Really makes coming in to work a lot more fun in my experience.","Quota is pretty high, most will not be able to hit it consistently without some luck going their way or being placed in one of the best geographic regions. However, management realizes this and will work with you if you are putting in the effort to improve - this isn't a ""miss quota twice and you're fired"" type of place, its about the value you are providing as a whole and how hard you're trying.

Benefits are very difficult to understand - when signing up, the UI is not good and afterwards its a struggle to find the exact details of different health plans / how to change them. Also ""Unlimited PTO"" is a nice dream but don't expect to be taking 3+ days off every month - metric requirements are definitely high and you have to work hard every week to hit them. PTO still has to be approved in advance by management, and it will be denied if you aren't getting close on activity metrics. However, managers are very flexible and will 100% work with you when things come up.

Product is extremely complex - pro and a con because having so many different features allows you to sell to 75% of titles out there which is very nice because prospecting is limitless, but completely understanding the product and how to pitch it intricately can take 6+ months. Nonetheless, its a really cool product that makes it feel like what you're selling actually matters - its becoming a staple of Enterprise tech stacks.

Company has exported a lot of jobs to India including tons of marketing roles, makes up a huge % of the company - makes things pretty siloed at times, along with time / cultural / language differences putting a strain on communications and content / campaign development. Currently there is limited marketing support for Sales. SDRs mostly just stick within their own teams, but collaborating across is difficult when necessary.

Confused transitions happening within leadership right now due to a few key leaders leaving. It's also very tough to transition between departments currently, several SDRs have been blocked from moving to solutions or customer success even after being approved initially due to a hiring freeze. Should be lifted relatively soon - prior to the freeze, moving departments was encouraged and pretty seamless.

Major tech stack changes currently being implemented (likely to cut costs) that are a big step back in my opinion, will definitely impact employee user experience and internal productivity. Not one single person in the company that I've talked to is happy about it, many are dreading it as much as I am, our tech stack was near perfect before."

Sure, there are some exceptions, but I have found that they are the ones with the most stress and they pass that stress to everyone that reports to them and at times they can be way over the top. While most people at Sprinklr (including direct managers) will make an effort to befriend you or at minimum be nice, SLT does not. It seems that they have embraced the role of being the 'bad guy'. 

I will say though, for some of the SLT, this leadership style is effective and they are able to get the job done. However, a lot of newer SLT members see this and try to copy it, and then it just becomes a hostile work environment."

The company has a simple way of seasoning consultants. They get pushed into high pressure situations, and they learn fast, and quickly start managing their own work. But they tend to be blind towards intricate details, especially in complicated IT product implementations. This has an interesting effect.

Everything about this company is an absolute nightmare. After a mass exodus (which is still ongoing, by the way) on the design team, they have started ONLY hiring specifically entry level women POC. Everyone above your average product designer however, is not POC. You tell me what that means. 

Hint: Sprinklr will continue hiring junior POC talent while grossly underpaying and overworking them because more senior talent knows their worth. 

Design system? Research? Don't set the bar so high now, we don't even need to talk about that stuff when everything else is falling apart. 

Here's how it works:

Leadership will yell at you and lecture you about what they think UX is despite having absolutely no relevant experience in the field. You will do what they tell you, pixel by pixel, back and forth, constantly. I'm not even scratching the surface of what it's like...just know that it's bad.

Great experience for learning what a toxic work culture looks like. It can only go up from here I guess. Don't do it."

Sprinklr,3.0,"Apr 12, 2022",Growing into the Tech Norms,Professional Services,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","New York, NY","Team Culture
Coming from an Agency background into Tech, it was the first time having a team rooting for you to succeed. A part of this is understanding that it was a time of unprecedented growth and needing all help to succeed at scale. The other part was a homegrown culture of inclusiveness to foster belonging to a team. Wins and losses were recognized with transparency, then at the end of the day, we'll come together to tackle the next challenge. Honestly, it was the epitome of figuring it out as we go.

Great Technology Platform
The technology is enterprise ready. Though very complex, it is built to embed and scale within a company. Being able to reference across other technologies, I take my hat off on how impressive the technology is and what it can grow to be.","Company Culture
While internal team culture was a breath of fresh air, outside of that, there are some toxic relationships across departments. It isn't unheard of to have tension between departments, however it's more pronounced at Sprinklr. Hopefully this will get resolved, but at its current state, it seems like the departments are less cooperative (outside of C-Level mandates) to work cohesively together.

Engineering Answers ≠ Process of Execution
While the technology is great, the complexity creates its own challenges in implementation, training, and adoption. This means the delivery of actualized value needs careful design and know how, which aren't intuitive to our clients. To stay ahead of the market, the technology has added ""features"" as an answer to competitiveness, while leaving the compatibility and know how at the wayside.

Total Compensation Package
In my time, as I advanced in more senior roles, the compensation packages were ""okay"", however they are not as competitive in the market overall. As of now, there are growing needs to reduce costs, so I don't see this as getting better. In terms of perks, they are standard, but not stellar in relation to the industry.

Diversity Challenges
As with many tech and companies in general, there isn't a large diversity within leadership positions. While I have had the privilege to work with some amazing colleagues who were female or a person of color, there were few representatives in positions of leadership. This does drive culture and it does show across the various departments."

I have been encouraged and empowered to contribute in a variety of ways across various initiatives and audiences. 

Sprinklr's strengths are: 
- a tremendous, industry leading/creating product with a drive to continue innovation
- An ever-increasingly strong and clear direction from Executives on down
- An openness and willingness among leadership to discuss obstacles, challenges, and faults 
- Strong, defined values
- A supportive culture with a family-first tenet
- Supportive work/life balance through a work/life integration mindset
- Support during the challenges of Covid
- A wide range of available benefits including access to ongoing education and wellness resources
- An improving company-wide structure for alignment of strategic initiatives and goals
- A steady and effective structure for personal professional growth
- Lots of big opportunities for involvement in strategic projects that can change the course of a product, a company, and a career","I do not feel that any of the cons below are unique to Sprinklr, nor do I think they amount to more than temporary discomfort (which itself is a useful strategy for personal and professional growth)

- potential for competing priorities/bandwidth on big initiatives
- periods of intense focus on production sometimes feels like multiple whirlwinds

Base salary was extremely competitive with a big potential upside with quota.  
They were very aggressive in their recruiting, and did an amazing job on selling me on the company.","My review mostly applies to anyone looking to join in sales (especially outside of NYC).   
While the company appears to be growing quickly, they are covering up several issues.  I left a great company and job, because I thought Sprinklr was a rocket ship.  Unfortunately, that has not been my experience, and rocket ships can also crash. 
 
In six months, I haven't received any leads or assistance from marketing, existing customers aren't really happy in particularly because the product is very difficult to use even after long set up times (2-3 months to setup).  As a result, we are pushed to sell a lot of professional services to help customers succeed.  Therefore, while initially the compensation package was compelling, it will be extremely difficult to achieve under this environment since there are some smaller, newer competitors now winning business.  The recent acquisitions of agencies, shows the company is moving away from being a true product company and is an attempt to fill in the product deficiency. 

It appears the company did a good job locking a lot of customers into 2 - 3 year deals, and as those come up for renewal, I would suspect they start to see some real churn."

* social media management space is trendy/popular/sexy","* VCE management team (incl. Tim Page and his army) has severely damaged the company, its culture, and employee morale.   
* sales compensation plan is poor.  Definitely below-industry.  Top sales talent is not going to join with such a poor plan.
* Endless fire drills and last-minute requests to fill out ""emergency"" spreadsheets, docs, etc.   Feels like the entire business is running in panic mode 24/7.
* complete lack of marketing.   No CMO and it shows.   No simplicity in messaging/positioning, product briefs,  pricing, etc.    Field making up its own messaging and creating its own marketing materials.  
* massive hiring spree has dropped the quality of talent significantly.   Hiring managers were ordered recently to fill a very large number of positions in just weeks.   Not surprising that a focus on quantity (versus quality)  resulted in a decline in talent levels."

Sprinklr,1.0,"Jul 28, 2021",Pixel pushing feature factory,Product Designer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Portland, OR",The design team has a lot of great people that really care and are trying to do great work.,"The design team is relegated to churning out UI tasks handed over from Product, typically with minimal to zero requirements or research to back up the requests. Everything is high priority. There is no real roadmap or vision for the product, so requests ultimately end up being asks directly from [big client] with little regard to how they fit into the overall application. Forget about any strategic product thinking or collaboration as a designer. Design is completely reactive, usually bouncing from fire to fire. Exploration, wireframing, and prototyping are looked at as a waste of time, all designs start in high fidelity drawing from an out of date design system.

Design patterns and components change weekly, if not daily. Designers are constantly running around trying to find the ‘latest’ design. Design standards and rules are not established. Be prepared to constantly redo your designs to match the ‘latest’ from another designers design file. There is no source of truth library. 

Leadership micromanages everything. Direction changes day to day, seemingly on a whim. You'll end up designing in circles as you try to address contradictory feedback or input given with no context of the actual problem. And you'll be asked why it's taking so long. Feedback is given without any reasoning as to the why. Don’t expect to learn or grow here, as designers are left to fend for themselves in their own silos dealing with subjective feedback.

Every few weeks people are shuffled around and teams are rearranged to work on the suddenly new prioritized feature or to put out the fire of the week. Churn is increasing as all the talent is fleeing and moral has been scraping rock bottom for months. Processes are completely dysfunctional, bottle-necked, and inefficient. Leadership seems to have little interest in fixing anything.

Design managers are experienced and truly care, but are stuck is a difficult position trying to support and setup designers for success with no support from leadership. Any proposals to update or change anything regarding processes are met with roadblocks or stone walls. 

Look elsewhere if you're a designer that cares about quality and design thinking or cares to continue to grow and learn professionally."

That's it.","Sprinklr has undergone many changes, including new senior management, in the past couple of years that have negatively impacted workplace culture. Career opportunities are dismal for entry-level employees unless you are part of the inner ""bro"" circle. Expect to work long hours and not get compensated accordingly, even after multiple stellar performance reviews. If you want support from HR you won't find it, they care about making sure their upper management isn't affected by employee complaints or ideas.  There have been multiple instances of Sprinklr not taking diversity seriously and not caring to expand their team for qualified candidates. Undergoing financial changes, multiple layoffs have begun. This place will ruin your career and your outlook on the tech industry because they do not care about their employees, they only care about money now."

Not neglecting the technology/product here, it is absolutely robust, innovative, and amongst the highest rated in its class.  Having said that, people are what will elevate a company from great to elite.  The people I've collaborated with are the smartest and friendliest set of co workers I've had to date.  Everyone wants to succeed but realize you're only as strong as your weakest link.

The most exciting part is that this is a company in hyper growth, who is becoming more and more structured, yet retains the very foundations of it's start up culture (the degree can vary by office location as some offices are smaller than others).  You have the snack bars, catered lunches, equity, social outings, and beer in fridge.  Sprinklr creates for a very exciting yet professional workplace at the same time, where for the first time ever I can honestly say I enjoy going to work.

Our leaders are absolute visionaries, they've created something very special and unique.  The key is employing passionate people who share the same vision, and that's what you'll get in Sprinklr.","Again, they're trying to be more structured so only if you're not a self starter then that will be a huge con, as you will not be baby-fed anything in the beginning nor after.  401K match is also currently not on the table but that is something the company is looking into."

Given that this is a global company, people are working at all hours depending on where they are in the world. It is important to make sure not to burn out. But I think this applies to work at any global company. We all must individually learn to manage our time and protect it, while being productive."

Brilliant minds all around you at all level - each with an open door policy who are willing to take the time to talk with you and hear your voice.

Compensation is fair and on-par with other companies.  Benefits are strong and there are a number of perks that any in-office or remote employees can enjoy.

Work/Life balance is amazing.  The CEO himself talks about how important it is to have a solid work/life balance.  Having the ability to take care of business - Doctor's appointments, Gym, etc. isn't a problem.

They really want to make sure they're hiring people that are the right fit for the company and personify their values. Also, they genuinely work with you to find the right position that fits what you're interested in.","- Personally, I don't see this as a con, but you have to be a self-starter to work here, and want to learn as much as you can (aka be proactive and responsible for your own knowledge and success). Not an atmosphere for the lazy or those that want to mentally check out once they leave the office.
- Typical growing pains of a start-up (fast-paced, constant changes, constant platform updates, etc.). Again, not a really a con in my book, but can be for those who aren't interested in that type of environment."
