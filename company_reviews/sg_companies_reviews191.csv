Moody's,1.0,"Oct 21, 2023",A miserable experience,Data Scientist,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Manchester, England",A place to start in your career,"Extreme workload - you are expected to consistently meet an unrealistic target and are made to feel that its your own fault if you can't meet it consistently. The blame culture is toxic and makes you scared of stepping out of line or challenging management. New systems were recently put in place, making the workload a lot more difficult to manage, but the target was not compensated for. This led to the whole team failing to keep up with the workload, and all the team left (there is a very high turnover of staff because workers are exploited). Finding a work/life balance is extremely difficult, as the increasing workload and lack of pay increases meant that finding a half an hour slot to take your lunch break was impossible. I was put on an improvement plan for not being able to meet the target and had my sick pay taken away from me despite having worked there for a year and a half and always meeting expectations. Also, you don't get any recognition for good performance, just a ""pat on the back"" email with a smiley face. Career progression is rare, as long time workers aren't valued. The pay is extremely low for the amount of stress, pressure, and high expectations the job comes with. Some teams aren't held as accountable as others (making a mistake while on my team wouldn't have been noticed on any other team). Suggestions in team meetings were never listened to. Management fails to recognise when their employees are struggling. A lot of the staff are passive aggressive and patronising. The company claims it values mental health, but punishes employees for having mental health issues by taking away their sick pay and scaring them into doing better by putting their job on the line. The exiting experience was also miserable and poorly handled, again, proving how little the management will value you as an employee. No bonuses apart from the occasional pizza party. Though some team members were nice, it felt like this was because we could relate to each other with how bad the company is. Felt like fighting an uphill battle against management, and always being told to ""get over it"". Your performance is solely based on who is checking your deal input. A subjective bias from some team members will result in you being errored accordingly, thus making error quality reports decline unfairly. The company does not value its clients, as recent changes made it so less deals would be added to the system for clients to access."

You get the following: 
- a culture of stagnation, where there is no need to push boundaries or trail-blaze. Instead, this job is almost like a pseudo government job. 

- as a result, this is not the place for a young ambitious professional. 


- due to 08/09, compliance might be the biggest spend. This a nightmare for employees who are interested in actual intellectual and financial analysis.  The company has been forced to over invest in compliance and IT security and has severely underinvested in software capabilities for their employees.  The CEO once said, “we are ten years behind in technology” and that couldn’t be more true. 

Ultimately, the question, will this ever change? No. 

This is because the CRAs have captured a market and must satisfy quality to regulators to continue doing business as normal.
