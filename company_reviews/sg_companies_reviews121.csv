Palo Alto Networks,5.0,"Feb 26, 2024","Pretty Good, But Slow to Innovate and Politics",Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Santa Clara, CA","My direct manager and new staff were very helpful and motivated people. This is a great company if you believe in the product and if you are going to work hard to push it to new customers. They support having a flexible routine outside of work. You learn lots of new things about the products because they buy so many. 
Everyone was willing to make time to help me. Hard work seems to be rewarded as you get more projects and get promoted if you work hard enough. Santa Clara office is really pretty and have a gym, great cafeteria, and endless snacks.","People at the top are rich friends that all came from the same prior company, and do play politics. Some employees in management positions were very condescending.
Blindspot of the company is they are not willing to innovate. This makes you do menial and repetitive tasks that are time-killers. They can buy tools to make some work processes more efficient.
They promised several interns full-time roles and went back on that due to budget constraints. They ended my time there in a way that lacked warmth or humanity..."
Palo Alto Networks,3.0,"Feb 2, 2024",Great growth and solutions but toxic environment,Marketing,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Santa Clara, CA","Company has had solid growth with key acquisitions over the last few years. Generally, compensation is good for the industry and HQ area.","Company has learned from the pushback off return to office mandates and press links. The have been slick with messaging and promoting the 3 day return to office as flex work, giving 2 days to choice. What they don't share is that there is now reporting based on badge scans and you need to meet at least 70% (until there is a change) and the systems is not set-up to recognize when are using flex time off (FTO, like PTO) or on a business trip. Within one team there will be 90/95% of the team who is remote status and a few who are tied to an office and are required physically report to the office. 

CEO and other C-suite are self promoting, does not follow company code of ethics and nobody holds him accountable. President / Head of Sales and CFO are the exception 
 
No 360 reviews for people managers so no real incentive to look beyond their direct reports 

Heavy use of contractors and then do not convert them and not out of the norm to work with people who only have been at the company a year or two. 

Constant org changes"

Employees are the last consideration when it comes here compared to other places I've been. Leanne can get up and say it is all they want but they don't follow through with it.
- There is no communication. Constantly finding things out after the fact.
- Leadership doesn't take responsibility when something isn't right and instead pushes the blame down
- 401k is a joke compared to other companies"

Learning Opportunities: The company offers various training programs and resources to help employees enhance their skills and knowledge, which can benefit career development.","Micromanagement: One of the most significant drawbacks was the excessive micromanagement from our District Sales Manager. Their lack of management experience created an oppressive work environment that stifled creativity. Toxic Workplace: The workplace culture was undeniably toxic, characterized by high quotas and unrealistic expectations. This led to an incredibly stressful atmosphere that took a toll on employees' well-being. Incompetent Sales Overlays: Some of the sales overlays, often referred to as ""speedboats,"" displayed a noticeable lack of competence. This hindered collaboration and made it challenging to achieve our goals. Lack of Accountability: Accountability issues were prevalent within the system engineering team, which had consequences for the organization as a whole.

Palo Alto provided me with all of the resources I needed and more. I had access to several free licenses of Palo Alto software, an AWS account, a robust MacBook, and I could purchase anything I needed to drive business with the corporate card. I built my own demonstration and simulation environments for customers, and I was encouraged to go hard on technical rigor. Palo does not try to cover up its technology in marketing or buzzwords, it enables its engineers to put the technology on display in its truest form. Palo Alto Networks also supported me through several personal challenges and gave me the flexibility I needed to support my family while working full time.","Palo has a long and complicated process for requesting a raise. Many senior managers support raises for their employees and the requested amount is in the range for the employee's experience, but the bureaucracy at the company slows down or stops the process. This makes it difficult to incentivize and reward great performance."

Some positions are probably fine, but some may have 100-150%+ YoY increase expectations with minimal existing pipeline. For engineers, internal promotions may be tied to fulfilling quota among other things. If you can accept that compensation and promotion risk, then go for it!

Collaboration rich. Flexibility to grow however you want. Ideal diversity, inclusion, culture and corporate integrity. Truly visionary CEO with a grounded and pragmatic approach toward growing the products and business. There is a sense that even though PAN is a clear market leader we are still in at the ground floor. The security is real, I cant say the same for many other vendors. Supposed product short comings are exaggerated and often outright lies. Throughout my journey I have seen no deviation from the stated objective of being the security partner of choice at all layers at any organization.","I have seen nothing uniquely or excessively negative. Every large org will have imperfections, theres nothing really concerning though. At worst I would say that the benefits could be better, but in fairness - the secondary comp and mobility potential is excellent, which completely obscures any heartburn that would ordinarily incur. There is probably more middle management than necessary in some areas but the environment is not stifled with beuracracy."

It is impossible for any leader or non manager to be successful at Prisma Cloud as current leaders are given impossible tasks or are toxic. Attrition remains high. Enablement is non existent, leaving even “veterans” unaware of how to sell the product. The product itself is a shell of what it used to be and non functioning most of the time, leading to generally angry customers and massive customer separation to various other products in the market.

I’ve met several different pockets of people who I love working, are great at their jobs, genuinely care, and want to do the “right thing”. Find the right pocket of people to work with who can insulate you from the broader Palo ecosystem and you’ll have a great time.","The “Overall Palo” culture is pretty terrible… C-level management has a reputation for being REALLY harsh and not making much sense — people have to spend a LOT of time managing up to them. Terrible at internal comms and policies. Last year it was “FLEXWork is here to stay - we’re making a commitment to letting you work when and where you want, forever”. This year it’s “Managers must be in the office 3 days a week”. They have MASSIVELY bungled the comms and positioning of this roll out (not to mention policy is terrible). As far as “big company” things go — they’re terrible. I’ve never seen a large company where it takes this long to get something through the IT department, Legal, or “Pricing”.

Coming up in November, the leadership team is forcing us back into the office 3 days per week. They’re still trying to call it FlexWork by saying that you get to decide which 2 days you can work remotely. But all new job reqs say “on-site” not “hybrid.” I believe that’s probably because they want the option to force it back to 5 days per week without all the employees calling them liars all over again. Employees already did things like move far away, sell their cars, etc. because everyone really believed it when leadership said FlexWork was here to stay. It wasn't. I guess 3 days on-site is better than 5 though (and that's exactly what they hope we tell ourselves). They say it's because they hear that tons of people are craving in-person collaboration now that the pandemic is wrapping up. For those who want to work in the office, nothing is currently stopping them. So if they get to the office and then they're lonely because the office is empty, that's an indicator the majority of people are not craving in-person collaboration.","Before I started working here, a friend of mine told me: “You’ll probably work harder here than you’ve worked anywhere else in the past.” I’m not afraid of hard work, so I accepted the job offer. After I started, I realized that he didn’t mean the amount or difficulty of the actual work. He meant the effort to get the work done. There are so many obstacles in the way due to the strange way the company is organized, the lack of consistent process across different teams, the bad communication, and the inconsiderate way decisions are made. If you like to understand what’s happening and get your work done in a consistent/planned/predictable way, you’ll hate it. If you like chaos, you’ll enjoy it. If you just want a job and you don’t care if you like it or not, then it’s fine."
Palo Alto Networks,3.0,"Oct 1, 2022","Too woke: Openly pro-abortion, pro trans kids messaging, not inclusive & diverse at all",Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","San Francisco, CA","- Nice office and work environment
- Flexwork / Remote work
- Great talent and team culture within Marketing org
- Great marketing leadership: bright, smart people that are also kind human beings","I think what really sucks about Palo Alto Networks is the recent changes in their culture: it went far-left so quickly I still can't believe it.
- The Inclusion & Diversity group should be renamed as the ""Woke Department"" since they only promote far-left topics, they enjoy bringing politics and other divisive topics into the workplace, plus justify and enable leaders that share controversial far-left comments in global channels (Slack). 
- Openly pro-abortion (CEO sent an email to all US employees about this)
- Openly pro trans kids agenda (I&D organized a ""support our trans youth"" event during business hours)
- The Women's Network Group is the most toxic feminist and aggressive group I've ever joined: through their global Slack group they openly attack other employees that don't share their views -or dare to post messages that don't share their values. The leadership only organizes events that feed their views, they don't care about female employees that don't agree with their perspective."

Company values make sense and ability to recognize peers for these values is such a boost.,"Each transition in the company has been accompanied by RIFs and despite being a company that expects to grow to $100 B in market cap, has inner politics that keep productive employees from doing their best work. Be aware there is more on the horizon to comparatively measure and micromanage people out. Also, panorama product and VM firewall have serious scaling issues that will probably never get fixed. Customers are working around these in ways that reduce the need to continue using Palo Alto Networks products."

Senior management and exectutives seem to be steering the ship in the right direction, this is comforting considering everything else that is going on the tech industry of late. Company culture is also excellent, with very few exceptions everyone treats their co-workers as part of the family, focusing on achieving the best outcomes for the products we deliver for our customers.","Not a lot of negatives to report, although some of the benefits could be expanded (401K compant match being the biggest issue) to match what other companies offer in simialr industries.

Palo Alto Networks,2.0,"Jan 31, 2023",Terrible WLB and work culture,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,Decent to great compensation depends on tenure and performance. Much harder to achieve great compensation with current RSU and performance rating practices. Great employees who rally and make the most out of a pressure cooker environment.,"PAN once was a great place to work but today is a battlefield. There are too many obstacles to duck in order to perform well for a sustained period...... constant leadership change and reorg, political battles between business units, aggressive senior leaders, and a frenzied pace that sends employees into endless unproductive firedrills. This is all exec leadership generated and perpetuated by an army of VPs. I feel sorry for previous reviewer saying he changed teams 3 times in 18 months as if it was remarkable. Those who have been here longer know this will happen to him again every 18 months. A lot of sweat and tears goes into operating successfully with this level of distraction. But cracks are starting to show. This just makes leadership squeeze employees harder instead of stopping their own harmful behaviors. See RTO mandate, insulting performance review policies, downgrade of every investment in employee experience, and you guessed it more change."

I hoped things would get better because the pay and benefits were good. So I held on, soon after hitting my one year my team changed again and my role/responsibilities completely. My manager told me during my review that since this was a new role and I was still coming up to speed on the expectations that he would be assigning me an approaching expectations not achieving. This is a role I didn’t apply for, didn’t request, and no one has mentored/explained the role. I thought maybe it’s just the segment I’m in. Not all the teams can be this disorganized. Unfortunately Internal Mobility told me that I cant change positions because I’m not achieving expectations. With this chaos, i should have stayed at my previous company.

Finding anything in the giant google drives is impossible even using tools like Glean. - They don't care about customer satisfaction, only customer adoption of their products. And instead of changing the business model to ""pay what you use"" so customers would be fully deployed all the time, they create homework for the customers and account/CS teams to create shared goals for the customer to reach. -Leadership is significantly out of touch at all times and has no interest in soliciting feedback. Or, if they do, they solicit feedback ONLY from particular groups to ensure it aligns with their message of what they want. - You can only get a raise or promotion if you're going above and beyond your job, but it's impossible to do so because of the workload, to take on anything additional."
