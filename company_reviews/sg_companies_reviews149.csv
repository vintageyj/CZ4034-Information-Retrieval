Good work/Life balance",none that i can think of
IDEMIA,2.0,"Mar 5, 2024",Bad Seed,Sales Manager,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,"benefits, some sales people and tech support",Everything about the VP (EP)on the access control side as he is just there for the money. Let people go for no reason other than wanting to make a statement. Told someone their job was eliminated when it was not as he did not like her arm ink
IDEMIA,1.0,"Feb 15, 2024",Customer Experience Coordinator,Customer Experience,Former Employee,"Chantilly, VA",Nothing literally absolutely nothing. I literally cannot think of anything positive here.,"Nepotism, lack of training if you are not a family member or a family friend. I literally overheard the manager tell her family friend to bring their laptop over their house so they can train them and show them the ropes during the weekend. But for other team members when they ask the manager for help she gets frustrated or tells us she only has time to work on a certain client. Seems like management positions are given to people who are clearly not skilled enough mentally to be a leader. Negative work place environment. Contestant temper tantrums from management. Coworkers crowdsurfing your computer as they walk by your desk. Oh and during my first week working there the manager made a wild assumption that I was living paycheck to paycheck. Last VP was a racist and you could tell she could care less about the employees but more about the money being brought in. Which rightfully so but she did not have a poker face at all. Needless to say the only time you would truly enjoy working here is if nepotism favors you. I would not suggest someone who loves their life to work here as this place can make someone miserable."

IDEMIA,1.0,"Nov 16, 2023",Lack of ANY management and communication skills,Machine Operator,Former Employee,,Many breaks (which are already mandatory),"I was switched from department to department with no attention to my agency that got me hired there. I had 3 meetings with HR and my agency and they were all astounded to hear I was switched jobs with severely-contrasting job responsibilities than each other without them being notified. Very unhappy, tired, sad, thought-absent managers that make up tasks to keep themselves busy. No communication between manager and employee and HR and agency the entire time and it was very frustrating to work there for 12 hours a day with such a horrible management ""system"". I was literally let go for something my ""trainer""/lead told me I could do and not get in trouble for -- the best part was I wasn't told exactly why I was let go until 2 weeks after I received an email telling me."

Lack of accountability from upper management when projects are in the red. Pay is extremely compared to the market value.
IDEMIA,3.0,"Sep 25, 2023",Pros and Cons,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",,The pros are that my team is great and the people who work at the company are very kind and get along well.,"The pay is not competitive. The health insurance is very expensive. The ""cost of living"" raises are laughable considering inflation. Asking management for tools and resources is useless, and for a tech company the technology available for day-to-day operations is seriously lacking. HR's hiring process is a nightmare and hasn't improved the entire time I've worked at the company. The top execs are constantly getting catered lunches, which is pretty discouraging considering I can't afford to buy lunch every day on my salary. After COVID, some managers allowed their teams to work from home permanently, but other boomer managers insist we come to the office multiple days a week even though we work better from home."

It really does the archaic paper finger printing done in the prison system, which is the sewer of a prison system. And this crowd is prisoner hungry. International prison system. God, what kind of sicko would do this kind of work. Swedes, Californians, and anybody who thinks prison camp work is a needed service and excellent way to benefit your customers. AKA No one matters but me people. Now that the pleasantries are over, let’s get down to the software business. There isn’t any. This is software customization of Java 1.0 maybe 2.0 I don’t know, and 95% of the code you cant get to and debugging is 10 times harder than normal because you can’t get to the code. And it’s almost all config files. Config file after config file after config file. And then the shmuck who “leads” the team doesn’t lead but he would pull me in to train new team mates on material I had not been told to take. Disorganized, archaic, 80’s scanners (literally), and a whole bunch of people who are fine with imprisoning people throughout the world as long as they get the money. Hitlers faithful."

I think the pay is fair.,"In 25 years or service we have been sold many times. About to get sold again. Not insider info just google Advent International sell IDEMIA. Each sale the company degrades for employees. Benefits fall, pay increases get smaller, on average 1% every few years. The company just announced we will no longer earn PTO time. It is a ""Unlimited PTO"" that they tried to sugar coat it but any moron with a brain can see it is only being done to get PTO balances to zero by the end of the year for the sale as all that time on the books is a negative for the company. Advent is a company like Richard Gere's Pretty Woman movie depicted. Buy companies, pick them apart and sell them to make the most money. Advent does not give a damn about our products or the people. Take away EARNED vacation which is money in the bank, and substitute a program where managers can more easily disapprove time off requests. I am waiting to see when the company that is next in line buys us and stops unlimited time off and goes back to a earned vacation program. That way all exempt employees are at ZERO in the bank."

Clear focus on growth and transition to digital markets; at the same time understanding that we are playing a long game so you don't live or die by the monthly result or quarterly result. 

The team in Paris HQ is extremely supportive of the regional teams, and in fact work long hours supporting customer calls early in the morning and late in the evening in Europe, to accommodate global time zones.

Depending on one's role, there can be a lot of autonomy in how to get the results needed in personal job performance. People who performer are encouraged to flourish and grow.","The shared services (IT, Finance, HR, Legal) are staffed very lean. Most people in these functions are very willing to help, however, they are also very overloaded and often not enough bandwidth to respond timely.

401k matches
PTO increases","What prompted me to write this review was a recent review by a VP that stated that working at Idemia is fantastic. This shows me the vast disconnection between the top and the bottom. Everyone on my team and MANY engineers that I speak to are always mentioning how overworked they are. Our CEO recently stated in a town hall that we are eagerly trying to fill open positions. However, the head of engineering recently told his department that all openings will be closed. In addition, my team was told this week that the open position on our team that we desperately need filled will be closed. So why is the CEO telling us something completely different ? Upper management is trying to cut costs all around so we are more attractive as a company but it’s at the cost of the lower level employees. Lower level employees, especially hourly employees, are underpaid. NO competitive salary whatsoever and we aren’t even eligible for company performance bonuses anymore. We work just as hard as anyone else! We are also encouraged to use all of our PTO by the end of the year but there is so much work to be done that taking a vacation seems impossible. Things need to change or the company will lose valuable employees."

If you want a glacier placed job coding in a swath of tech debt, this may be the place for you. Take a look at the uenroll site, it hasn’t change in years. It was supposedly an overhaul from their previous dumpster fire site but looks like history has repeated itself. They had a whole team of “production ops” dedicated to keep the pile of junk running because the former engineering team failed to utilize best practices. A great place for yes-men to thrive; but challenge status quo and get a slack on the wrist.


 Management only cares about themselves and is not in alignment with with engineering, as evidenced by the high turnover. Teams act like independent islands not working in concert with each other.

Maybe they’ve update a few processes and got own board with a modern cloud provider but progress has been painstakingly slow"

IDEMIA,2.0,"Aug 19, 2021",IDEMIA needs help,Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"Amazing products and technology that are changing the lives of all daily. Great engineering team, from the top down. It is obvious that the CTO is constantly working to make things better and communicate to his org. PTO accrual is good, but only when you have managed to stay on 2+ years. Great HQ location in Reston Town Center and you get perks at retailers/restaurants and free parking in garage. Company is trying to promote diversity and inclusion, while changing culture and instilling values with new CEO.","Poor leadership that is really cut-throat. Poor culture. Constantly walking on egg-shells. Poor paternity/paternity leave. Lack of vision and connectedness due to the many leadership changes and re-orgs. The company cannot keep good talent. Promotions are few and far between. Not very competitive when it comes to pay, unless you are a sr. manager or above. HR and Finance departments are a disaster, so onboarding and task items are always a challenge. Internal processes are awful, requiring lots of hand holding and constant checking in to see if things have progressed. Environment is very clique-y. Company culture is almost non-existent, they definitely do not live up to their values. Most the work force is male and white."

IDEMIA,1.0,"Dec 14, 2022",Worst company ever,Senior Software Manager,Current Employee,,The company provides a paycheck.,"Management is immature and self motivated. Lots of talk about changing to support career development but no action to support this goal. This is due, primarily, to the lack of management capability. Promotions are primarily due to politics and connections or desperation that people will leave, not performance. Stay away if you want to feel good about yourself."

Management tries to be accommodating with life events.","IDEMIA has the tendency to get the the most out of people, sometimes at the expense of personal health and well being. Work-life balance is lacking.
Working in a large organization (which could be similar at other large companies) can be difficult with red tape."

IDEMIA,1.0,"Sep 29, 2022",Unbelievably disorganized and toxic,Night Auditor,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Exton, PA",Some of the people who worked there were wonderful.,"I worked as an auditor on the night shift, which means I counted over 20 boxes of 500 credit cards at a time using terrible counting machines that were extremely out of date. The warehouse is the most disorganized thing I've ever seen. They give you a number and you have to search through a huge room to find a big heavy pallet that sometimes falls apart when you push it, making sheets of cards fall on you. No one was able to help me because there is absolutely no system to keep track of locations. In addition, I encountered people on the night shift staff that were blatantly homophobic, transphobic, and racist, as well as one guy that I'm pretty sure was abusing his girlfriend that also worked on the night shift. Don't get me wrong, some of the people who worked there were really great people, but management does not care at all about helping with issues. I actually remember hearing that security called some black workers into the office because they thought they saw them making ""gang signs"" over the camera. Absolutely insane. I'm not black but just hearing about the things which they go through there made me sick. Also the pay isn't worth it.

It was also important to keep track of an audit sheet that listed where every card was at every time. But nobody filled it in correctly because it was poorly laid out and we weren't allowed to edit it. We did though. Everybody did. Because otherwise we'd have to search everywhere to find the person who messed up the sheet and often they weren't even on our shift! 

When there's nothing to do you have to go through the cards and pick out rejects only for the quality control head to put them right back in because the company does not care about the product they put out.

Also I've heard that this place used to be better until they got bought out by a French company and the entire thing went downhill immediately."
