    "\n",
    "In the code example provided earlier, I used a threshold of 0.05 (and -0.05 for negative sentiment) to classify the sentiment into positive, negative, or neutral categories. This threshold is somewhat arbitrary and can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your application or the characteristics of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why I chose 0.05 instead of 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutral Sentiment: Sentiment analysis often deals with texts that may not express strong sentiment in either direction. By using a threshold slightly above or below 0, we can classify sentiments closer to 0 as neutral. This allows for a more balanced classification, distinguishing between slightly positive, slightly negative, and neutral sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Variability: The choice of threshold may depend on the variability and characteristics of your data. In some datasets, sentiment scores may vary widely, and using a threshold closer to 0 may result in a large number of neutral classifications. Adjusting the threshold allows you to fine-tune the classification based on the specific characteristics of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Application Specifics: The choice of threshold may also depend on the specific application or task you're working on. For example, in some applications, you may want to be more conservative in classifying sentiment and only label texts with strong sentiment as positive or negative."
