Amazon,3,2016-02-20,exciting work abusive culture,senior engineering manager,current employee more than 8 years,"Seattle, WA",jeff bezos and his steam are brilliant and continue to make great decisions for longterm growth you work with smart people you work on exciting projects you are pushed to your limitswhich can be rewarding when you accomplish great things the diversity of the potential work and innovation can be very alluring ive often called amazon my sexy mistressshes emotionally abusive but shes so sexy that i go back for more punishment,the management process is abusive and im currently a manager ive seen too much behind the wall and hate how our individual performers can be treated you are forced to ride people and stack rank employeesive been forced to give good employees bad overall ratings because of politics and stack ranking
Amazon,4,2013-12-17,can be amazing for some people horrible for others,software development manager,current employee more than 3 years,"Seattle, WA",amazon is doing lots of cool stuffbut lots of boring stuff too there are really well run teamsand very badly run teams the experience for software managers and engineers is all over the board from really run low operational load teams to teams where people burn out after a year amazon is built quite deliberately to be darwinian you can generally expect that anyone whos been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldnt have survived you can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned there arent many slackers here and they dont survive long we work on so much stuff that theres always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on note that its an opportunity one that you have to pursue a chance to make a huge difference a place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things both technical and about yourself amazon encourages high mobility even your manager cant prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks normally more than a few months under unusual conditions your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what amazon does without you having to explain,youre responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do no one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that amazon is built quite deliberately to be darwinian the strong survive and the weak perish metaphorically speaking and the bar is constantly increasing the level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today its a kind of crucible thatll help you develop a harder edge if you can survive that can serve you well in your career and in life but its often not a pleasant experience i wouldnt recommend it as a place to work for just anyone
Amazon,5,2018-02-23,an amazing place to work,software development manager,current employee less than 1 year,"Phoenix, AZ",ive been at amazon for a month now and ive seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public although amazon is a large enough company that im sure there are good pockets and bad pockets everyone here is really smart and wants to succeed both personally and as a company people collaborate and help each other focus on data and truly focus on the customer every company ive ever worked for talks about how important the customer is but on day 2 theyre forgotten amazon seems to genuinely focus on whats best for the customer and its awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up and make decisions focused on longterm customer satisfaction the opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well i honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here,no cons so far seriously like i said im sure amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there but this is an amazing job an amazing opportunity and the biggest thing i have to complain about is that its a little chilly in our building i can live with that does amazon demand high quality measurable results yes is it hard work yes is it rewarding yes so im not calling that a con worklife balance seems comparable to other places ive worked not worse
Amazon,5,2018-12-03,amazing company and the most driven and smartest of the people,software development manager,current employee less than 1 year,"Phoenix, AZ",you can learn a lot very quickly in a very short time surrounded with nothing but incredibly smart and driven individuals compensation is well beyond my expectations and more than suitable exciting projects all across the company that keep you interested and focused amazon is changing the world,can be overwhelming very steep learning curve can be difficult to keep up if you are not self motivated
Amazon,4,2017-03-23,we are now in a world where we are condescended to by our inferiors,anonymous employee,former employee more than 5 years,"Seattle, WA",this company gets a list performance from c list employees the culture is quick and hard charging you are always working in relevant and meaningful projects,maybe because the company recruits c listers who have neither merit intelligence strategic vision nor pedigree academic or professional accomplishments most of those who become successful do so in treacherous low cunning ways imagine the lannisters in game of thrones attacking the starks in game of thrones or rawls and burrell attacking mcnulty and daniels in the wire or barrow and obrien attacking mr bates in downton abbey this is every day leadership behavior at amazon the culture at amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to manage people the work itself was stimulating and fulfilling but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges then just converted their winky nod nod good ol boy shenanigans into a ask no questions have no introspection company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded and the connected incestuous privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street
Amazon,5,2020-08-30,overall a great company with high standards,fc associate i,current employee more than 3 years,,challenging sometimes fun work environment being part of a team doing great things great people to work with,organization and communication can be a challenge to maneuver around hours can become a challenge when managing a hectic schedule having to be available for any shift in order to move up in certain positions work expectations and policies can change and can be confusing
Amazon,4,2014-09-19,a huge diverse high tech company with all sorts of stuff,software development engineer,current employee,"Seattle, WA",disclaimer my opinions reflect that of an sde in amazon seems like some operational job functions are very tough i have read through some of the other amazon reviews and it seems to me that everyone has a very different experience this is so true within the same team you can have both workaholics and slackers coexisting and coworking together i think i am more of the balanced type as i try to stay sane the amazon experience is basically the entire spectrum and it is what you make it out to be pros in amazon certainly excludes great benefits but compensation is competitive free food means average quality free coffee once in a while free pizza for lunch where it is a working lunch and free beer and finger food in special events we get a free orca card to take any bus in the seattle area for free $160 per month subsidy for office parking which is better than nothing downtown monthly parking goes for about $200 per month 401k contribution is 50 of what you put in where you can put in max 4 of your salary not so great staff cafeteria food is average and not at all cheaper than outside food or could be even more expensive it is hard not to complain about the cafeteria vacation days are ok but note that there are no sick leaves they count as part of your 5 personal days per year listing the benefits of amazon is like listing the cons and not the pros work life balance seems to be ok for the most part and seems to be individuallydriven no one will tell you that you have to come in at what time and stay till what time i have team mates working every night and weekend and others getting in at 10am and leaving at 5pm all in the same team managers will focus on your project deliveries instead of how much time you spend working if you work 40hour weeks productively you can definitely outperform someone who works 60hour weeks but dont deliver stuff working less than 40 hours per week is somewhat common but i cant say how many people are working how long the view on work life balance is a bit skewed all it comes down to are the managers and what they think projects are always neverending but i have found that deadlines are very realistic and reasonable without counting your nights and weekends getting some slack time once in a while is probably a sign of a healthy work environment everyone needs a break oncall really really sucks basically all it comes down to is having sdes doubleduty as support operations engineers note that oncall does not improve the code quality of any team in any way the oncall experience is particularly bad because you are using services from some other team and their code is of low quality and fails for the wrong reasons if the managers had given more time to up the quality there would not be so many problems software is usually delivered with a tough deadline with code that meets the minimum quality bar and never gets improved for the next few years the code review process does not seem to help improve the code but it really obstructs developers from making great changes as unconventional things will not pass code review in clumsy minds innovation and excellence are not the name of the game in amazon searching through the amazon code base is usually not going to turn up quality code that you can actually reuse integration is the name of the game in amazon you will need to spend a lot of time to figure out how to integrate your code with another teams services whether these other people are cooperative is a hitormiss i have found that most people are responsive and helpful but there are also quite a number of jerks who are out to make trouble for everybody it is not easy to work across teams but the experience is mostly positive amazon is a huge behemoth and is hiring people like there is no tomorrow this reflects well on a good growth momentum but also is worrying that the company is not turning much profit if the company does not make money where is our bonus going to come from you can see new faces around the amazon building almost everyday downside is that we are taking in a lot of average to aboveaverage engineers and being an amazonian sde certainly does not share the same reputation as the top names amazon is a huge mixed bag of some very talented people and some very dumb people i think the world is not turning up enough sdes and the only way is for quality to go downhill as an sde expect to spend most of your time talking writing emails and documents and maybe around 2030 of your time coding in most of the teams you can work on interesting projects but probably not revolutionary ones note that amazon is a very downtoearth company and the work is very downtoearth as well you will work on real things that people have actually requested for and that people will start using as soon as you are done work is challenging but not to expect highly technically complex stuff most of the work has to do with solving everyday problems to me this seems to make sense because i have ever tried working on experimental projects before elsewhere and i did not feel it was a good use of my time internal mobility is a key strength of amazon and i am not sure which company has done better than amazon in this aspect internal moves are easy you only need to stay in your team for a year before moving to a different team there is no easy way to tell which team is a good team to move to because they all have their different pros and cons and people and coming and leaving all the time seattle is by much rumour an easier place to live than the bay area overall amazon is a tough but yet sane place to work the flexibility of this company is really its core strength you have the freedom to excel as much as you want and also to slack as much as you want bummer you shouldnt be slacking,beware of bad managers and horrible team mates they are not specific to amazon but they do exist in amazon i have to admit that monday is usually a blue day at amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office i dont know anyone in amazon who looks forward to getting in on mondays be realistic about sde requirements coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job i think we are hearing the same thing from every company medical coverage is average or below average expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay more anything outofpocket sde advancement is unreal difficult they have about 6 levels total sde 14 then senior principal engineer and finally distinguished engineer the number of sde 1s and 2s are huge trying to get to sde 3 seems to be allofasudden extremely difficult but not impossible so this essentially means that if you come to amazon as a fresh grad sde expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality you will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else employee retention is horrible i am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources management all say that they are trying to retain people but actions dont seem to suggest anything better rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible this basically mean that either you are a superstar in the company before they will try to retain you or if you are smart you should not stay in amazon for too long
Amazon,4,2017-05-15,warehouse associate full time for over two years,tier i warehouse associate,former employee more than 1 year,"Carlisle, PA",great starting pay and the ability to get raises very quickly full training in all areas are offered and if your willing to work hard and sweat everyday for 10 hours a day 4 days a week then this is the job for you the 4 day weeks go by quick it can be exhausting so proper rest and a healthy lifestyle will help you stay strong within this company beat benefits as well once you are a hired on as a full time employee,after 3 years of working with the company you cap out at $1575 meaning you can no longer make any more money than that as a tier 1 associate your expected to want to move up in the company and that is the only way to make a better hourly wage by advancing into management and operations management positions if there are any openings
Amazon,4,2017-03-29,great place to learn churn n burn culture in finance,finance manager,current employee more than 1 year,"Seattle, WA",super smart people the best of the best from schools if you get hired here you will be hirable anywhere recruiting process is tough the pay is above average probably 15 times elsewhere but the expected results are 150 of elsewhere too lots of opportunities to work on new innovative projects cool slu campus lots of options for food and drinks after work,frugality is taken to the extreme only 2 weeks vacation parking takes a year or more to get zero perks not even free prime no fitness allowance poor 401k your peers will stab you in the back your manager will blame you for their errors you cant trust anyone people who throw others under the bus and take credit for other peoples work get promoted expectations 60 70 hours a week some teams expect sunday to be an in the office day headcount never gets filled teams are always short a few people but the work keeps piling on
Amazon,4,2024-01-17,a decent job but you will work very hard,general warehouse associate,former employee more than 1 year,"Wilmington, DE",the benefits and compensation is pretty good for a job that you can take without a degree you will get in shape as you will vigorously work daily in a physical way this is a job that almost anyone can do as long as they are physically able its not difficult to learn or do this work they cycle you between different positions in the warehouse so youre not stuck with one that you hate forever they give you flexibility in how to use the time off that youre given and accrue as you work this can be used to cover tardiness there is some opportunity to take on more responsibility in a leader role,there can be challenges to working a night schedule 120am1150am the shift is pretty long especially because you will be labouring and moving nonstop for most of the shift the fast pace of the work doesnt slow down for you you have to keep up its a bit like being on a treadmill the culture and expectation is that as a worker you will comply this isnt bad in itself because receiving orders in a chain of command is good but there is little freedom in this job in some jobs youre given a responsibility with some freedom in how you pursue it like a project or something but the nature of the work in this position is that you are pretty much bound to do what youre told the work is very rote repetitive mindless
Amazon,4,2024-01-30,amazon does real engineering but its often a pressure cooker and youre often just a number,senior software quality engineer,former employee more than 8 years,"North Reading, MA",amazon in north reading is a pretty good engineering environment with decent management there are opportunities to work on a variety of projects and interesting hw and sw projects are often well funded ideas are generally welcomed and often lead to new projects good benefits collaboration is promoted and supported a good place to learn,youll often feel like a number as amazon which can sometimes treat people like a body in a slot and hr feels very impersonal and is not known to speak up for employees against management its often a pressure cooker with tight deadlines and unrealistic goals in many offices people dont know each other and theres not much camaraderie culture or community north reading is generally better than most amazon offices with a lively social culture but its getting to be more impersonal over time employees are secretly stackranked against each other by management they usually deny this but ive had it confirmed by several managers and its been written up on the net extensively this can lead to highachievers suddenly being put on unrealistic pips performance improvement plans leading to job loss very few people survive the pip process which looks designed to push the person out most members of sw engineering teams are required to participate in oncall duty which often means multiple days of 24 hour support every few weeks
Amazon,3,2024-02-09,not a great future,it support specialist,former employee more than 3 years,,the pay was good based on the workload in the beginning great place to learn and get your foot in the door for it,the workload ramped up tremendously after a while with no extra pay the supporting of multiple buildings was introduced the past year two years ago it was a great place to get promoted now its difficult to get promoted without being buddies with upper management they promote the wrong people who display little to no expertise while others have it or the certifications to prove themselves and who want to move up very disorganized and clueless management who cannot agree on anything and forget conversations or messages almost immediately no backbone from management in upholding tickets and projects slas expect to bend over for anything operation management demands like a toddler throwing a tantrum and your own bosses yelling at you to get it done even if it goes against the ticket or project policies lack of building knowledge past your level and not growing basically it becomes a deadend job get in for about a year and get out fast use the time to earn your degree or certification and get out before they drag you down to their level
Amazon,5,2024-01-02,better than i was was expecting,software engineer in test,former employee more than 1 year,"San Jose, CA",helpful team teammates were always ready and willing to lend a hand or help out manager cared about our growth mgr was always looking out for our team and how to make sure we stood out both as a team and individuals so when promotionspay raises came up we had a better shot when compared to others solid benefits benefits were great and pretty cheap would like more pto tho lots of room for growth moving around amazon was always possible mgr would even help if you asked had access to free aws resources that was not limited to just active work projects but could be used to experiment and learn about aws and development never a dull moment there was always something to do whether it was an assignment from leadership or a teammate or an idea that you yourself had trust from leadership when leadership would assign us a task or goal they trusted we would make the rightbest decision for the team and company the roomers that your manager will work you into the ground are dependent on your manager and director,organization restructures would happen more often than i would have liked other teams would be slow to respond to tickets but expect prompt responses in return it took management way to long to look intoaddress the issue being on call every 3 to 5 weeks when team was small stock pay out being y1 5 y2 15 y3 40 y4 40 although the first two years you are compensated with more cash would still prefer a more traditional y14 25
Amazon,5,2015-04-06,everyone is very nice amazon web service team is best out of all good work culture one of the highly paying job,anonymous employee,current employee,,vibrant fast paced culture smart fun aggressive colleagues management is focused on latest tech trends and staying or becoming a leader for many of them by and large customers and partners are very positive about the technology good benefits and perqs,worse still is the politics when you hire a bunch of smart aggressive people and put them in an environment of outsized expectations throw in a bunch of reorgs and changing management and sprinkle with uncertainty and constantly changing priorities you inevitably get people back stabbing each other and throwing others under the bus to appear smarter and more worthy of promotion
Amazon,2,2024-02-01,any experiences is a learning experience,fast food and warehouse,former employee,,the pros of this job was meeting new people opening new doors for the betterment of my futures and others and the different experiences that allowed me to strive to do my best and to succeed with support of my managers and other associates,the cons of working at amazon was disrespectful associate and some managers the environment was not clean causing sickness due to dust and grim in equipment when i had ask for assistance with my health i was mocked by am care the dismissal and disregard of the associate by hr and higher ups being disheartened by the lack of compassion and sympathy that was not shown during hard time for associates either amazon is a place to find your footing and also to go and open new doors for yourself such as school medical and dental benefits accommodations and mental health support and the pay is fairly decent but even with all of that amazon seems to lack any sense of compassion understanding or sympathy towards its workers as if we dont matter and we are just a number by breaking down and burning out their associates anyone can work there as long as you understand what your getting yourself into
Amazon,2,2024-01-28,take the role if you need to put food on the table immediately,area manager l5,former employee more than 1 year,"Somerset, NJ",the company had good medical and retirement benefits the compensation was ok for a fresh college graduate during the pandemic,the really long work hours 12 hour shift x 4 days standing and walking around during peak season 2 times a year you are expected to work 5 days a week without extra compensation because the area manager position is a salaried position for the area manager role you are expected to micromanage the associates all the time while you are micromanaging the associates you are also expected to complete the routine administrative tasks and work on spacial projects the administrative tasks is what you have to do and the special projects is whats going to get your promoted all these tasks were expected from you without any support from management in both mentoring and resource this role have a huge toll on your body even worst if you have night shift take this role if you need to put food on the table immediately but you keep looking and leave once a better opportunity comes along

Amazon,4,2024-01-19,pretty solid,area manager ii,current employee more than 3 years,"Richmond, VA",usually has a good company culture really depends on the building you work at and your team my building recently went through a change and they ended up cleaning house on most of our bosses l6+ amazon can be a very cut throat work environment best advice i can give is to just keep your head down do your work and engage your team need to make sure your team respects you likes working for you without the respect of your team you will never make it,too many cons to share there are political games that are played at all levels like i said earlier keep your head down do your work and earn the respect of your team 2x times as hard to build a bridge that has already been burned
Amazon,4,2023-12-06,tenured amazonian,finance manager,former employee more than 5 years,"Seattle, WA",i worked at amazon for almost 8 years and one thing about my experience is that no two days were the same i loved the challenge of problem solving with the fay 1 mentality and model the pay is great and pto and benefits are top tier amazon has a ton of resources and vendor relationships so it was great to take advantage of certain perks like free movie screenings and discounted car rentals one of the best parts of working at amazon is the ability to rotate to different teams which helps avoid cultural adaptations when transferring companies most people who work at the company are self driven and easy to work with,although the pay is extremely good you definitely pay for it with your time my first two years i was consistently pulling 1214 hour days on average which leads me to my next con the amount of accounting work that had to be completed manually was unbelievable even worse the businesses were not properly supporting backend functions with reliable systems to track all transactions this led to way more work for the accountants in assessing completeness and accuracy and more tech debt we were being tasked to resolve lastly although benefits are pretty good at amazon theres a significant flaw in the sabbatical policy which discourages some of the most tenured employees from taking much needed breaks

reject as much as possible but that could be all providers for all i know other employee benefits aside from healthcare are nice the campus is well maintained and nice the caffe has great food that is pretty inexpensive for what you get on campus gym but its getting more expensive for some reason discounts on apple and third party products services occasionally youll get free swag occasionally there are campus parties not so much since covid and never as good as cupertino,tl dr near zero growth opportunity within applecare and very hard to be seen as a viable candidate to the rest of apple career growth pacification programs that provide no real advancement or growth restrictive rotation and career experience programs rather than allowing you to flourish and apply for real world experiences from other departments as much as youd like you are restricted to once every six months to a year every six months your schedule will likely change upending your personal life you get hired for a specific role then get various other roles dumped on you with no pay raise management will randomly move you around to different managers desks for no reason management either does not care about you or has no power to make real change when necessary so they just bs around everything oh man ive grown into a bit of a curmudgeon during my time here so ive definitely got cons despite what some will ultimately believe is some sad sack who sabotages themselves into being where they are that is not the case im not saying that my feelings havent spilled out over the years but i mainly keep this stuff inside and uphold composure all of this stuff is true sadly if you have a hunger and desire to grow your career and advance within apple and you came to applecare ac thinking that this would at least be a nice starting place you have chosen poorly ac is where talented individuals get trapped within a sea of mediocrity and complacency so many people are just meh and have no desire to advance therefore you cannot advance within the organization and since its apple its already extremely competitive so when opportunities that you would qualify for which are few and far between unless youre a hardware engineer or programmer with years of experience open up its nearly impossible to stand out to a recruiter for them to even give you the time of day because the executive and upper management level of ac know that there are next to zero opportunities due to the competitive nature of apple they have created a career growth program designed to make you feel like they care like there is possible opportunity and that this program will somehow benefit you despite it not providing much in the way of anything they have career coaches that have barely had a career themselves seriously they had the same job that you have right now then became coaches give me someone who has actually advanced they give you free access to coursera which is nice but it does nothing to make up for the lack of experience or education most roles require and it offers what are called rotations which is where you work for another team for up to six months getting real world experience likely doing a job that youd actually want to do but without the pay however the likelihood of getting a job from a rotation is about as likely as you getting struck by lightning on a clear day in the desert as the majority of the orgs that offer rotations are given zero budget for additional headcount they are perpetually stuck rotating new people in and out every six months they hate it as much as we do they wish they could hire some of us as much as we wish we could be hired were all restricted to one rotation per six months so in the event to where youd be amazing for a role that maybe just maybe might just wind up being able to hire you too bad so sad youre stuck in your regular job watching someone else advance whos been there a fraction of the time that you have simply because they were in the right place at the right time to rub additional salt into the wound we get emails on the rare occasion that someone is actually hired off of a rotation as if the career site had anything to do with it even better theyve barely even worked at apple going from a retail role to just skipping right over you making six figures easy now i assume theyre an amazing person who is killing it but i dont know what i do know is that i never got the opportunity to present like this person did because of this stupid one rotation every six months rule once every six months your schedule will most likely change potentially upending your life its apple right if they put out a request for people to work odd hours they would still get a crazy amount of applicants but for whatever reason rather than hiring for a specific shift we all get judged by our metrics these are metrics that are impossible to perfect due to the nature of our job so no matter how hard one might try to get perfect metrics so that in turn you get first pick of your schedule it wont happen so you might work from 7am to 4 pm half the year then 11 am to 8pm the other half maybe you need weekends off because you have kids who are enrolled in sports and you want to be there to support them too bad so sad if your metrics werent good enough to get first pick whereas once you may have worked monday thru friday now you work saturday thru wednesday or have two random days off rather than consecutively you get hired for a specific job then over time you literally take on the job of several other organizations lets say you get hired to assist mac and iphone customers cool two products though these products include all of the builtin apps and services you can become a master over these two things and get amazing feedback from all of your customers ie excel in your role then the org decides that they want to take on a completely new products because they want to merge your org with what once was a separate org for reasons and it happens again and again and again and no you arent paid more because of it now youre supporting mac ios lets say apple watch apple pay apple fitness + the apple tv apple tv+ apple vision pro apple whatever therefore you knowledge gets very diluted and you are overall a less helpful person who to a customer doesnt sound like you know what youre doing on top of that management cant help but want to shake things up for no good reason so youre often moved around within the office space itself and youre often moved around to different managers or to managers that you previously already had then got moved from and are now back under its like they have nothing better to do or some budget that they dont want to lose access to and moving us around costs money or something you create this fantastic working relationship with those around you helping each other out getting to really know people then bam you get moved sometimes you get to start over and really get to know a whole new group of people that are awesome but sometimes you get sat next to some guy that doesnt shower sleeps all day only to be woken up by a phone call before attempting to nap again or are sat next to someone who has anger management issues and slams their hands against the desk because every single customer frustrates them etc no wonder they treat applecare like children it can be a daycare sometimes i dont know why they allow this kind of thing to continue management doesnt care about you any time you bring up a legitimate issue you have to set up a meeting for when theyre available which can be weeks later sometimes only to be given some really politically correct bs response where nothing happens its like everyone is just biding their time waiting to retire or die and

Apple,5,2024-01-11,great company,hardware associate engineer,former employee,,the company culture is great a culture of collaboration where you can get a lot done and be exposed to experts in many different fields my experience talking to hr was refreshing they were very frank with me even when it meant going against the interests of the company in favor of my career,collaboration with people at different sites in other cities was difficult as long as you could meet someone in person things went very smoothly but working with someone over slack or on video call only was not great i would recommend asking about whether or not your team is distributed and how the team is handling that in your interview

Apple,4,2023-08-07,data analyst,sales operations analyst,current employee more than 3 years,"Austin, TX",its great to be part of a company like apple there are smart people everywhere and you have the opportunity to get to know any of them ive had mostly good luck with managers and the other leaders ive met all seem to be good people its definitely a place where you can get comfortable and ride out your career if you want or you can work towards more if you want to gain more experience,its very difficult to get promoted internally the only real opportunity for promotion is within your current role internal moves to a difference teamorg are all considered lateral there isnt much you can do to influence your annual review and raise whether you did the bare minimum or went above and beyond youre most likely just going to get achieved expectations and the standard cost of living raise leaders dont always reward hard work its difficult to change anything its a big company with old processes systems and people which enable those things youngnew employees always want to change things for the better and then often find out that they will have to get comfortable with the way things are unless someone higher up wants something changed 3 days a week in office is not fun they arent flexible with that its very corporate if you like that great if youre looking for a startup techy environment this isnt it if you arent in a technical role you get screwed on pay and stocks they give you the bare minimum and then give the whole world to the engineers
Apple,2,2023-09-04,recession proof work if you can tolerate the culture,apple genius,former employee more than 8 years,,the salary is livable at least where i worked you get great discounts on apple products and from partners you get great training opportunities you get benefits if fulltime we had benefits for parttime as well where i worked,promotions seem to be catered to whom is most popular and cushy with the managers rather than who is most competent the schedule often has these terrible shifts i call clopen shifts where you leave at 9 or 10pm and come back at 8am or 9am depending on day with commute this can mean you have no time to get even 8 hours of sleep they have these quarterly meetings everybody has to attend even if it is your day off if you do not go then the management gets upset with for not being a teamplayer they are obsessed with metrics as the managers have their bonuses tied to the metrics even if it isnt your fault and your customer gave you bad review just because you couldnt repair the device you will get penalized they do not fly you down to cupertino anymore they cheaped out and do online training instead unless management approves you cannot even do school parttime as they cannot guarantee you an evening off every week

Apple,4,2024-01-17,pay is great stress is high,manager,current employee,"Chicago, IL",collaborate with great talent your ideas are heard and you can have impact on others,stress is high pressure to maintain high kpis in a knowledgeable market is difficult team members can care and give 100 but new employees into the workforce lack the care of each other and customers leaders dont have each others back and it can be difficult to lead others in environments that dont have cohesive leadership
Apple,2,2023-12-15,avoid applecaresupport advisor roles,senior technical support advisor,current employee more than 1 year,"Raleigh, NC",decent benefits great coworkers a lot of great managers discounts for apple products stocks great 401k,lack of opportunities getting a rotation or ceinternship is largely luck based how well you perform in your role doesnt matter for the aforementioned applecare is just another call center with apple branding now all they care about is the metrics and whether or not youre meeting them pay is comically low for getting into a senior role and being expected to handle all ios and mac related calls
Apple,4,2023-12-07,personal review,sales specialist,former employee more than 3 years,"Naperville, IL",the relationships you build at apple are incredible you meet some of the most incredible people you are put into this position where you can not only help build relationships with your peers but build them with customers i loved going into the building every day getting to learn something new about everyone who walked through those same doors,in the past it has felt like the company was very heavily focused on the people aspect for at least a year the focus has heavily shifted towards numbers sales goals and everything you would expect from apples competitors it is very discouraging to have management almost breathing down your back when you are not hitting certain numbers
Apple,5,2024-01-30,great company to work for,sales specialist,current employee more than 3 years,,flexibility with scheduling and the environment working with new people and the energy is always amazing with employees and customers,management will be a major con depending on which location you are working at or who youre working with some managers are very easygoing some managers are micromanagers

Apple,2,2024-01-14,operations sales,specialist apple store,current employee,"Tucson, AZ",great benefits coworkers were nice,its retail and customer facing customers are going to make you upset the store will always be busy and you will be asked to put on a smile at all times also there are many employees and finding a fulltime role is rare in my case the store leader and senior manager were mediocre and they only cared about themselves and their little clique it was condescending and also ironic that a store leader and senior manager who did not know how any of the products work can tell you that you need to improve performance when they cannot offer help themselves they would just hide in their office and ignore the madness of the store especially during peak hours on the weekend part of the reason why we were always behind on appointments additionally we would be required to put in pto a month and half or two months before the actual date while they were always out on vacation it was demeaning and obvious that they did not care about the overall happiness of their employees also the worst feeling about working at this store location is that senior management did not promote from within when the store had so many talented people who could lead this location to success there were so many employees who spent years working here that were overlooked for leadership roles when they 100 deserved it instead it would be common for leadership to hire externally and bring on people who had no tech savviness whatsoever again it would feel demeaning to have an outside hire managerlead try to rate your performance when they didnt even know how to use an iphone

Apple,3,2024-01-13,its ok for like a year or two but dont expect many career opportunities,specialist,current employee more than 1 year,Melbourne,the team are excellent you make lifelong friends with most people includes free private healthcare university reimbursement up to 5k per year and 700 reimbursement for gym membership but dont expect any free products the culture does teach you a lot about resilience your journey can teach you even more about navigating complex issues but expect to learn most of that on your own word of advice dont tell anyone anything they will use it against you and stay far away from experts and pros they are not your friends theyre self serving paid snitches who tell managers everything,the worst aspect is a customer review works as 5 starts is 100 but 4 stars is 50 how is that fair one review can absolutely nose dive your team member score plus there is no tangible incentive especially when you consider each pt team member can sell around $152 million in products annually then they say youre not meeting expectations which is bs when you consider the amount of sales team members do in a year no bonuses are absolutely ridiculous not even a christmas party theyll provide chips and chocolate in the break room cough cough wheres the fruit the expectations of customers are absolutely ridiculous customers expect you to know everything on a measly wage can often be very demanding and just insist you do everything and dont actually listen management doesnt empower team to say no expect to be dealing with a lot of customers of all ages gen z to boomers who are completely incompetent and not interested in learning the basics instead they come into the apple store with all their issues they could easily solve with the most basic problem solving skills culture can feel overwhelming and fake recently the culture has shifted to more results focused with no financial or tangible rewards they manipulate you to pursue growth but its literally impossible to grow to their expectations unless you sell your soul to them most managers are absolutely useless at providing any assistance when youre facing challenges with customers will often bend to customers or reverse the question so you have to deal with them but have to shout out to the few who work very hard and are incredible the stock program rewards staff with a 15k bonus with stocks each year but they vest over 3 years so its just another way to manipulate people to stay

Microsoft,4,2013-01-28,thoughts after 10 years,anonymous employee,current employee more than 10 years,"Redmond, WA",1 if you love tech this is a great place no doubt youll talk tech mostly the msft stack from enterprise to consumer from pcs to phones to xboxes from datacenter to desktop 2 what were great benefits are now very good took a small step down but still probably better than youll find at 99 of large corporations if youve got family the value of the benefits is even higher 401k match is nice 3 even with its struggles msft is still a cash printing machine this means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work you can have a stable job pay your bills feed your family and not worry too much about layoffs the stock you own likely wont tank but probably wont go up much either youll get a bonus each year and some stock its a decent life if you arent looking to light the world on fire,brand on your resume after many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that theres 90000 employees dont think msft is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies managing your career make you say this out loud so it registers 90000 employees work there double that for vendors it is very hard to stand out and move up in the company dont expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too not familiar with the stack rank check out the 2012 vanity fair article called microsofts lost decade
Microsoft,4,2024-02-10,can be a great place to work if you find a good team,senior software engineer,former employee more than 8 years,"Redmond, WA",ability to switch jobs internally within microsoft to work on all different kinds of projects in all areas of software different teams have different cultures and practices so look for a team thats a good match for you in general the culture is improving on customer focus and growth mindset although management can be political and chaotic the folks at the ground level generally are supportive of each other and stiving to make the best most positive products that they can lots of resources to do things on a large scale and have a big impact microsoft takes ethics seriously and has a real commitment to doing the right thing,difficult environment for innovation microsoft tends to be better at improving existing products than creating new ones microsoft puts a lot of effort into innovating but it often reorganizes changes directions or cancels projects before things can pan out lots of meetings and process that comes with being a large company that has to coordinate between teams although this isnt generally the case some old microsoft teams can be very stressful and power struggles between teams and leaders are common
Microsoft,4,2024-01-07,good company to work for,senior product manager,current employee more than 1 year,,as far as big corporations go microsoft is one of the best ones to work the company culture is overall great they emphasize a growth mindset and try to care about people they have strong emphasis on diversity and inclusion which helps everyone think about how to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment the pay and benefits are competitive because of all the products they work on you can work on different products and move teams without leaving the company theyre also making a lot of great strategic decisions which gives me faith in the leadership and direction theyre headed,while the company culture overall is good and they try to emphasize good values its a huge company so you can have a vast difference in experience depending on where you work if youre interviewing make sure you meet with your hiring manager evaluate them and ask questions about the culture of the team a lot of work is still seattle centric which makes it difficult to be visible if youre new and remote impacting promotions influence etc if youre getting hired for a pm position make sure you understand what is expected from the role it looks vastly different depending on the product and its needs i would recommend staying away from products that arent growing especially as a pm
Microsoft,3,2024-01-23,more of a program management shop,sr product manager,current employee less than 1 year,"Chicago, IL",company employees are very nice helpful down to earth and very family oriented opportunities within the company are plenty i also think though no experienced yet that the troubles you have to get into a type of product role you dont have experience in is not faced once you are within however you do you have to go through all rounds of interviews like external candidates except 1 or 2 rounds if you are within the same overall organization from the top,company still isnt doing true product management and is much more program management oriented dont get me wrong i am sure there are few products that do run a product shop but i had been hard pressed to find them also organization is very siloed and broken up so there are so many dependencies across departments which slows down how fast you can generate impact
Microsoft,4,2024-01-22,handled layoffs respectfully,senior software engineer,former employee less than 1 year,,i only worked at microsoft for about 8 months after my company was acquired by them but had a positive experience overall a lot of nice benefits good pay and opportunities if youre able to find the right role for yourself my position was eventually eliminated and i was laid off but was given 3 months of severance pay and felt that microsoft handled the process with dignity obviously nobody wants to get that call but it ended up being a good catalyst for my career and having the 3 months of full salarybenefits to take a break and job search was really nice,as with other large corporations theres a lot of bureaucracy and rigid process hard for me to comment much further due to my short stint and unique situation with the corporate transition as noted above they also were going to have us give up our macbooks which is hardly a surprise given that its microsoft but that was very unpopular with most of the engineers coming into the organization
Microsoft,3,2024-02-15,teams consist of people whove worked in the same team for at least 5 years,software engineer ii,former employee,"Redmond, WA",they know ins an outs of the product,good luck getting them to share openly this doesnt speak for msft as a whole but people who stay at a place longer tend to have set preferences dont want things to change too much can be hostile towards people who are new and different in their approach good luck communicating with such folks msft has been a stable company where people tend to stay long its good for their stability but there is a reason you need diversity
Microsoft,4,2024-02-13,good place to work as a lifestyle job,anonymous employee,current employee more than 3 years,"Atlanta, GA",they prioritize work life balance and give great benefitsvacation the work has a global impact and the scale of the company is massive they tend to have the smartest people working there,very little authority to execute projects because of the influencebased culture consensus has to be reached before anything can get done and then every step of the way there are people who dissent question push back etc it is also extremely challenging to switch roles right now especially if working for a manager with whom you dont work well

Microsoft,4,2023-11-10,heavy sales,customer success manager csm,former employee more than 1 year,"Minneapolis, MN",microsoft has amazing products and services for enterprise customers so many companies use themcreating a lot of opportunity the culture as a strong learning mindset and encourages people to grow and try new roles so its always interesting and new,even if youre not in a sales role youre expected to sell the latest stuffeven if your customers arent there yet also while the culture is very employeeoriented encouraging diverse and focused on work life balance and wellness it can be very stressful due to the demand to produce new sales and they have their own internal language and acronyms that have 12 different meanings that takes a while to adapt to on top of the fact that their products and features change so rapidly including their product names its almost impossible to keep up so be awareonboarding is like waterskiing without skis you get dragged while hanging on for dear life
Microsoft,5,2023-09-17,microsoft is what others wish to be,director,current employee more than 10 years,"Charlotte, NC",microsoft is a technology company built by engineers from the ground up and designed to be run by engineers gates the company had a dark period under ballmer but thats because he was not an engineer and did not fully understand how engineers think and what they respond to and it was reflected in the flat stock for more than 10 years we now have an engineer at the helm again in satya nadella and the company is back on track to continue to do great things pros great culture you get to work with really smart people decent salary good work life balance good top level managers placing the right bets at the right times,the baller years were not great technical training is an issue msft will let you work as hard as you want so your work life balance can get out of whack some people do not like the employee ranking system but that is often because its not understood its not terrible but the company can do a better job of explaining exactly how it works the rifs are always rough but sometimes necessary

Microsoft,2,2024-01-23,its improved but still has a long way to go,senior software developer,current employee more than 8 years,"Redmond, WA",the culture at microsoft has improved since the beginning of the millenium a lot the elimination of stack ranking was a good move healthcare coverage is excellent as are other benefits perks+ flexible working location etc,there is still a lot of micromanaging that hurts employee morale and creativity many in midtoupper management are still learning to shift away from the old culture microsofts pattern of regular layoffs and then hiring new people is for lack of a better way of saying it cruel

Meta,5,2014-03-17,open fast no bs,software development engineer,former employee more than 1 year,"Seattle, WA",it might be easy to roll your eyes when people from facebook say how open their culture is but its true its more open than any other place ive worked at at a company widelevel secret projects public incidents important nonpublic business metrics and the like are all openly discussed you can ask questions about them directly to zuckerburg at the weekly qa i think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least differing views are heard the company will be stronger and solutions may be offered from a place you didnt expect this is much different from previous companies i worked at where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that theres certain things that cant be discussed and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a need to know basis etc this culture applies at a lower level too you feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other about product decisions about management etc the flipside of this openness is that you of course have to be willing to receive the feedback you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged decisions have to get made and actions and data are more valuable than words at the higher level since the company trusts employees with access to so much information keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously its a great place to work as an engineer youre given a lot of freedom but its also a responsibility to make sure youre doing things that are valuable you dont get much credit for working hard or being smart if you dont produce valuable output one cool thing about facebook in contrast to other comparable companies google amazon and microsoft though in truth fb is much smaller is how they have a pretty singular focus even with the differing areas including advertising and such they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible i also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for it seems like popular opinion has it that fb is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $signs from within the company it didnt feel this way at all i saw a lot of empathy towards users and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit the strategy is not complex the thinking is that if they can make fb easier and more fun to use then more people will use it for more time each day which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it then the advertising dollars will follow of course it is true that fb wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well but there are a lot of people at fb who care about privacy and security they have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code they have a lot of cool internal tools and what theyve built is really impressive and more importantly it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved every software company tries to do this but fb seems to have been more successful with it perhaps its because theyre still relatively small but if anything i can at least say it is very cool while it lasts the perks and work environment are great unless youre one of those types that cant stand open office spaces ive worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies while i do think a private office has some benefits i mostly think its a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company id much rather have the money go into other areas like salary benefits and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices of course youve heard about the food and snacks they have an amazing selection of great stuff and what i like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations sure some days lunch is better than others but i really cant complain and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing its not like you should work at fb just because of that but it demonstrates fbs desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible youll be surrounded by people who like being there i cant think of a better environment to work in if you have a giant ego you may not like it as much respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees however if for whatever reason you cant perform at the level expected no one is going to care if you did this and that at google or shipped ten things at ms etc fb also has a lot of fun events and i made a lot of friends working there so going to the events was fun also if youre older and worried that fb is just a bunch of 22yearolds and that you wont fit in i wouldnt worry about that fb does have a lot of young employees who are really smart btw and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like google ms amazon etc worklifebalance seemed totally normal to me it may be different depending on your team but i felt you could do 4050 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine its about what you produce not how hard youre working other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times i didnt see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that of course there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly from what i observed now there were many times where i chose to work late myself but i never felt any pressure to do so the caveat is that there are oncall rotations and in addition even if you are not oncall you are expected to be reasonably available if the oncall person needs your help however again no one wants this and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations the best thing i can say is that working at fb is about productivity i didnt experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it,fb expects a lot out of engineers and you cant slack off of course you shouldnt slack off at any job but since fb is pretty fastpaced there is a risk that youll have trouble adjusting at first fb has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools and prehaps more impressively it works great it makes doing your job really great but on the other hand youll end up learning a lot of stuff that wont be applicable elsewhere fbs codebase is very good in some ways but in other ways its not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is i dont think this is that big of a deal but the important part is that as an engineer you need to quickly learn fbs values and practices and get with the program so to speak if you dont like some things then you just have to deal with it as its not likely youre going to change peoples minds at this point the nice thing is that things are at least very consistent
Meta,5,2017-02-16,fast paced company with high expectations but incredibly fair you wont a place that cares more about its people,anonymous employee,current employee more than 1 year,"Menlo Park, CA",incredible benefits excellent compensation that rewards strong performance lots of autonomy tons of room for growth very transparent from the top down strong leadership intelligent and caring colleagues the most fair and well thought out review process you will find everywhere exciting work,if you dont learn to make the work life balance work for you it can be exhausting but youll also be given lots of support with this if you ask for it it doesnt matter how good you are at your job chances are youre going to be surrounded by a ton of other people who are just as good if not better imposter syndrome is real but if you got an offer you probably belong here too
Meta,5,2016-02-16,pleasantly surprised,site selection program manager,current employee,"Menlo Park, CA",im a 55 year old working in a company where the average age is 28 and ive never been happier i have always wanted to work in a company where i wasnt the proverbial square peg and after nearly 30 years in the work force i believe that i have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate here are the pros as i see them leadership mark zuckerberg sheryl sandberg chris cox and the rest of the leadership team inspiring smart and totally real the culture the openness is a real thing were trusted to do the right thing mistakes are expected being yourself is important and encouraged humility is encouraged and expected building trust is paramount the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isnt just a cool phrase because it guides everything its not about us its about everyone else the people smart and nice is what i find the diversity is better than any other company ive worked at and its getting better those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas two years ago i didnt know what this company really was or if it had a secure future i can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last and its sincere management managers are hired because theyre good managers and not because theyre good at something else the management track is different than the contributor track and theyre equal in importance benefits working in the valley its hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies but coming from seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible granted i havent been with the company for very long and im still in the honeymoon period but i can tell whats real and whats not this place is for real,like any tech company the work is big and complicated so worklife balance can suffer from time to time the difference is that its the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance but its not such that 1012 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless we do what we do to get the job done no one is killing themselves because theres an order to do so being able to eat to your heartsstomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline but thats a selfcontrol thing and not the companys issue

Meta,3,2023-11-26,great workplace but higher management can bring issues,production engineer,current employee,,meta really can be an incredible place to work in terms of perks they will certainly look after you meals healthcare life benefits etc top class in terms of all that also compensation is fantastic which is a big + tech teams are full of very great people and overall there is a really good work ethic,the people team who manage things such as psc feedback season and make decisions this year about remote policies etc is so disjointed and seems to consider the actual employees last in the equation there is a complete lack of transparency and everything can change on a dime which it makes it difficult to have stability in your own life which thus makes all the perks that bit more redundant also in terms of learning and career opportunities for those earlier in their careers you will be learning things a very meta way everything will be inhouse which can make it just that bit harder to transition out of your role to a company using industry standards

Meta,5,2015-05-01,landslide win over google for career growth,software engineer,current employee less than 1 year,"Menlo Park, CA",i just left google and joined facebook and felt so much happier the reasons are 1 the real impact at google i joined a team whose product is only used by less than 1000 people and even for that product i was assigned to do a peripheral part whose functionality actually doesnt matter at all just for that module i had to write unit test for every silly part of the code and took long iteration cycles i admit those are good engineering coding trainings however taking precious time in my life to work on something that doesnt matter is just a waste of my life in facebook things just move so much faster there are standard software engineering review process but not as rigid just during training boot camp weeks i had tasks to change very important part of facebooks core code and the second day after i checkin my code it got shipped to almost 1 billion people as a software engineer i cannot recall a moment i felt better for my job then i joined a team thats extremely important to facebooks revenue a mistake in the code i changed could cause facebook million dollar a day however facebook just trusted us allowed us making mistake and having quick iteration cycles to test ideas fast if i make a coding mistake in my team in google it might cost google nothing in terms of revenue as my product was small however the development process was so strict i could not have chance to try my innovations or test my ideas but in facebook thats all possible 2 the organizational structure googles organization is now very structured and hierarchical facebook is having more layers but the working style is still flat and socialnetwork style speaking to people in different teams form an idea lead a virtual team and complete it this style is still valued my boss is more like a mentor helping me navigating through the ideas rather than an authority telling me what to do,1 i dont quite like the office decoration style a little bit stressful and factory like 2 the compensation is better than google but not as good as other smaller companies 3 despite good acquisitions for solidify the position in social media social networks there is still uncertainty about the future of this company

Oracle,1,2024-02-09,you get treated based on performance,business development executive,current employee more than 1 year,"Austin, TX",do well get treated well like the favorite child make sure your managers love you and you will be loved back when the stress from upper mgt trickles down to you just say youre right and thank you for pointing that out its that kinda org,mess up prepare for hell and daily threats of getting fired with reminders of how useless you are their training programs are ineffective you only learn from yourself or your peers you have to pave your own way it doesnt get any more traditional in terms of climbing up the ladder here you have to keep a bragging report of your achievements and network your way in and people have to like you to get promoted your numbers are not enough people with less achievements have gotten early promos that dont make sense stress is insane here you can see fear in your managers eyes and tone your managers will tell you one thing and deny it the second their upper manager tells them otherwise because everyone is that afraid to make a mistake here employee morale is continuously surprising us how low it can go goooooooooooood luck also forget bout taking holidays because youll need the numbers to prove it even if youre fine youll be terrified about how to compensate the days wasted on rest
Oracle,3,2024-01-30,this company will slowly take advantage of you as your career stalls and workload increases,business analyst,current employee,"Austin, TX",good pay many of our support teams are remote and you dont need much tech knowledge aside from excel most of our tools are built and developed inhouse so you dont need a degree in it or coding knowledge to work as a business analyst with finance and sales data,its a well known secret that the only way to get a pay increase is to leave the company then get rehired for the same role as an outside hire this is mindboggling and leads to a massive brain drain throughout the year one reason for this is because bonuses and raises are not a thing you do not have a performance review and there are no career milestones to work towards leading to effectively a deadend job finally most operation teams are seriously overworked this is caused by people leaving probably to seek more pay and management temporarily giving their workload to someone else on the team while they find a replacement this never happens i know some teams that shrank from 10 to 6 analysts and stayed like that for years and no we do not get more pay with these increased workloads trust me ive asked
Oracle,2,2024-02-02,average big tech experience,principal program manager,current employee more than 3 years,"Washington, DC",depending on which line of business you work in you might get unlimited pto which makes the north american winter break period a plus instead of a minus benefits are decent with notable extras like gympass and a decent amount set aside for training employee resource groups are an excellent way to network and meet other colleagues in the mnc,oracle has a tendency to buy up everything and just hope for the best when it comes to integrating those new companies into the new parent company what you end up with is a hodge podge of fragmented businesses that dont know how to work together also oracle loves doing silent layoffs to keep out of the news so they cut just enough to not activate the warn act usually right before a quarterly earnings call or during the beginning of a new fiscal year if you work here always keep your resume updated
Oracle,5,2024-02-14,love this company,contract administrator,current employee more than 3 years,"San Antonio, TX",working at oracle provides a unique and positive experience due to its hybrid model this approach allows employees the flexibility to balance work and life effectively fostering a healthier work environment the unlimited sick time policy demonstrates a commitment to employee wellbeing ensuring individuals can prioritize their health without added stress moreover the culture of treating employees like adults creates a sense of autonomy promoting a collaborative and respectful atmosphere overall these factors contribute to a workplace that values worklife balance health and a mature approach to professional relationships,the only downside of the hybrid model is having to come into the office twice a week the volume of work can get overwhelming at times due to complexity and dollar value quarter end months tend to be extremely busy and can leave you feeling completely drained
Oracle,3,2024-02-16,terrible management terrible compensation,senior principal consultant,current employee more than 3 years,,the benefit package offered was good there was an opportunity to learn a lot and develop skills,coworkers who had less experience were hired in at higher rates when i tried to negotiate based on this knowledge i was not offered anything better the consulting practice manager would brag about his bonuses and how he was able to order fancy cars high end watches and build additions onto his home it was completely inequitable i later found out that other consultants were able to negotiate certain terms in regard to their projects no documentation no travel beyond wednesday or thursday no travel on sunday

Oracle,2,2024-02-08,netsuite decent compensation highly questionable culture,emerging account executive,former employee more than 1 year,,excellent introductory sales training accessible leadership young energetic workforce lots of company networking events multiple offices strong compensation plan you can make a lot of money at this job just be prepared to work extremely hard as an account executive,there are a few things that really soured my experience working at this company territories are wide open and netsuite places hundreds of reps in a free for all in each territory this breeds a cut throat culture amongst the reps if you take this role you will be subject to reps trying to steal leads that fall out of your name if you are an outside hire you are at an immediate disadvantage as internal promotes have had years of practice within the crm already and are akin to taking leads from their peers and finding ways to funnel new leads away from other reps just to themselves which brings up another part of the job that really brought down my motivation top performing reps in recent time figured out ways to funnel hot inbound leads away from our inbound queue that is supposed to fairly distribute each of these leads as they come in and had them only funneled to themselves either by creating searches to get in front of these leads unfairly before they were distributed or getting an assigned bdr to do it for them under the table it was revealed that all of our top performing reps had been practicing this which lead to around 10 or so reps per region closing all the large inbound deals leaving the rest to fend for themselves and scrape up anything they can finally only around 20 of the entire sales team hit quota last year partly due to top reps gaming the crm system and funneling every single good inbound lead to themselves leadership fully ignored this and instead of punishing those reps in question gave them a slap on the wrist and promoted them netsuite is a sink or swim company with surface level nice guy corporate behavior to mask the deeply negative leadership backroom politics that take place favoritism lead sniping and inbound engagement malpractice run rampant i guess this can come with being such a large company after the oracle purchase netsuite really evolved from a cool start up type company to a corporate beast where youre more focused on infighting with your coworkers than actually closing business with prospects on the outside on top of they have an extremely keen focus on tracking metrics and micromanaging your day to day there were leaders who were 23 levels above managers looking at reps day to day performances also youre ability to move within the company is currently very limited you can apply to 10+ roles within oracles opportunity market and not get a single chance to interview even if you personally reach out to the hiring managers be cautious when accepting a role here its a smile at your face while stabbing you in the back culture grindfest and it will not be fixed any time soon
Oracle,2,2024-01-09,good potential falls way short,bdr,current employee more than 1 year,,great coworkers in the bdr program and good training all the benefits that come with the job and great as well,bdr management is awful the entire process of working here has been frustrating even if you hit your quotas serve over your supposed tenure and overachieve in qualifying bringing in new business it wont help you get promoted leadership plays favorites from what was once a promote everyone mindset they over hired unqualified people and now that sales are down due to a combination of external factors as well the rest of the bdr organization has to suffer bdrs are deceived into thinking they still have a chance at promotion before getting handed an excuse that there were only 2 spots that went to more unqualified leadership favorites this happened pretty much monthly id rather have committed to a different program if i had known how unreliable netsuite was

Oracle,3,2024-01-01,oracle review,principal product manager,former employee more than 3 years,"Reston, VA",oracle is a large company with lots of opportunities the stock has done well since oracle is a cheaper investment into cloud compared to amazon microsoft some products and business units are a pleasure to work with especially former acquisitions,your experience will vary widely depending on what business unit you are in and what product youre aligned to the wrong business unit and senior management and your time will be miserable find the right fit and it can be a very rewarding and fulfilling period of your career compensation is ok but not as competitive as oracles counterparts in the tech world theyll swear up and down that they pay competitive rates in the market but the reality is compensation increases will be much faster if you go somewhere else or leave and come back especially if you arent given rsus as part of your compensation

Oracle,3,2023-08-16,the most bizarre job ive ever had,office support specialist,former employee,,the pros with my position were the leniency and the lack of micromanagement its very well known that if you work in a mailroom youll have plenty of downtime which was a huge benefit for me being a student at the same time the job itself was easy as long as you did the basic work downtime no one breathing down your neck at all times easy job to fulfill,facilities is not a long term job for anyone to be honest the facilities role gets treated with some disrespect youll be viewed as the help could be dependent on where you live but the higher up the people you interact with the more they tend to look down on you so be prepared for that youll be verbally told how much youre appreciated by management but it truly does not mean anything because they will never pay you an extra penny for your extra efforts do not ever expect a raise unless you get an offer from a different company for better then they might try to keep you by paying you off basically there is no reason to work harder because there is no incentive whatsoever other than fulfillment of doing a good job and a thank you do enough work to keep your job but not too much to be relied on for extra work without the proportionate pay you deserve for it

Salesforce,4,2014-07-09,still a lot of opportunity to learn connect and chart your own course but big company culture is encroaching,anonymous employee,current employee more than 8 years,"San Francisco, CA",ive spent over 8 years with salesforce in various management and individual contributor roles all customer or partner facing some of the pros vibrant fast paced culture smart fun aggressive colleagues management is focused on latest tech trends and staying or becoming a leader for many of them by and large customers and partners are very positive about the technology good benefits and perqs hip urban culture at hq a chartyourowncourse mentality that rewards those who aggressively seek out the job they want and pursue it or sometimes even create it,after my long tenure and many dreamforce conferences im nearly fried to say the culture is fast paced and the focus is always changing is an understatement the reason salesforce always seems on top and chasing the latest trend and in the press is because employees are expected to run harder carry more cheer loudly and pivot constantly its the worlds biggest startup in behavior but at the same time with the recent influx of top career sales leaders from oracle and what appears to be a boardlevel mandate for doubling revenue employees are being asked to do even more with even less fill higher quotas with smaller territories less help and the big company bureaucracy is rearing its ugly head worse still is the politics when you hire a bunch of smart aggressive people and put them in an environment of outsized expectations throw in a bunch of reorgs and changing management and sprinkle with uncertainty and constantly changing priorities you inevitably get people back stabbing each other and throwing others under the bus to appear smarter and more worthy of promotion the few at the top will get very very rich the rest will lose the sense of personal ownership and start to wonder why theyve given up health and family
Salesforce,3,2020-11-30,what a disappointment,account executive core team,former employee more than 1 year,"San Francisco, CA",benefits are top notch perks in the tower and holiday party are impressive sales tactics and strategies are great for growth even as an experienced rep youll meet very talented sales rep with a wide variance of styles espp generous maternitypaternity leave although this will affect your likelihood of be promoted,i came into salesforce like every rep excited and eager to get my mba in sales working here youll have to be prepared to give up everything just to stay afloat in the first year you will most likely be given a terrible territory and what you do with it will decide your future here things you will need to juggle effortlessly or will lead you down the road of being let go are activity lots of calls people who fib numbers here are celebrated by leadership but frowned upon by reps opp rigor the amount of fields you will need to update are mind numbing pipeline with a terrible territory be prepared to pipe aspirational pipeline that will be highly scrutinized prep meetings there are endless prep meetings before calls due to schedules each person involved will require a prep meeting leaving your day with little time for anything else team selling be prepared to sell with folks much junior than you and not held to as high of standards if the deal falls through its on you there are a few coprimes that are skilled sales reps your brand its important to maintain appearances even on bad days your brand is determined by how involved you are in diversity volunteer work and leading the team which requires tenure manager 11s these are a trap to look out for salesforce preaches trust as one of it pillars but beware that everything said in those meetings will be used against you when they have soured on you time management working a 12 hr day is table stakes there are endless distractions you will need to navigate and make hard decisions on brand appearance maintenance vs selling the worklife balance is very heavy on the work side the exec team repeatedly say their biggest regrets are not spending enough time with family this will never change if they dont take it serious there is a lot you can learn here but at the expense of your self confidence as some managers make you feel worthless when your awful territory isnt performing if that isnt enough to make you steer clear the pay is very low and less than 20 of reps hit their annual numbers the ohana culture is a mirage there is nothing remotely familial about the culture it is an ultra competitive pressure cooker i just had such higher hopes for my experience left disappointed

Salesforce,3,2024-01-26,new performance ratings signal a big shift in culture and careers,program manager,current employee more than 3 years,"Philadelphia, PA",pros still attracts some of the greatest coworkers around peers tend to genuinely care for each other the customers and partners on the ac side and want to help each other be successful build job security and more the work is interesting and there are loads of resources to grow personally and professionally if you have anything left over emotionally to invest in yourself,everyone is scrambling to still justify their roles work and departments to mid level leaders that seem disconnected from the top line decisions being made about programs people and layoffs the result is a report on everything culture of micromanagement and having to spend so much time documenting the job its hard to find enough time to do the job let alone engage with ergs personal development or outside of work board positions and volunteering this period of uncertainty and change makes it hard to get your footing many people including myself had had 23 managers in just the last 8 months
Salesforce,3,2024-01-22,changed significantly through covid and beyond,solutions engineer,current employee more than 3 years,,,leadership has been very weak since layoffs too afraid to stand up for their team or themselves due to fear of layoffs upward mobility is extremely difficult be prepared to do the job of a principal while being compensated for much less if you want to move up in a company i cannot suggest salesforce as it is typically luck of the draw or how you were hired role expansion with no compensation benefits every year get worse and worse they are taking things away slowly managementleaders only care about managing up be prepared to get minimal assistance from those above you

Salesforce,1,2024-02-04,good luck,account executive,former employee more than 3 years,"Seattle, WA",its a large company with seemingly endless opportunities the benefits are great,pay leaves a lot to be desired there is very little training and development in place within certain orgs so you need to be selfsufficient there are a million levels of middle management so everyone is a vp of something and nobody is good at their job people in all levels of management within certain orgs are completely incompetent the peter principle is how it is best described everyone there thinks that because they work there their blank doesnt stink the arrogance is obnoxious if you ever need help with anything dont expect to get helpful answers from anyone plan on searching internal systems and learning on your own forget product training better use google and youtube managers are not your friends nor are the other employees if you say something to someone trust that everyone will know so keep it related to work the people there are only in it for themselves and will happily stab anyone in the back to get what they want if you arent in the inner sanctum you will feel like an outsider very clicky environment

Cisco Systems,4,2015-03-13,the grass isnt always greener,manager network services,former employee more than 3 years,"San Jose, CA",i decided to wait almost a year after leaving the company before posting a review the primary reason being is that when you decide to leave an organization it is usually because there is something there that isnt aligning with you or what you want anymore however the grass is not always greener someplace else this has been my experience in fact the appreciation i have for the company has grown so much in my time away that i would really like to return the company truly believes on promoting within and as an employee you are encouraged to grow your career within the organization and learn new skills by taking different positions benefits are excellent cisco is the industry leader for networking and now cloud it is sometimes easy to forget that on the daily grind but you are working for the company that everyone looks to for network and infrastructure standards culture within the business units managing product lines give you a lot of freedom to be innovative and creative in your approach to your role in most cases you are given a fair amount of autonomy and control over how you do your job provided that it aligns with the strategic objectives benefits 401k match rsus and espp are amazing and while the salaries arent the top of the industry they are above market and pretty competitive,cisco can be a machine there isnt an overt demand for all of your time even the time outside of work but more of a subtle slight encouragement to always be on if you are not careful you will live sleep and eat cisco 24x7 dont get me wrong this is 100 a choice and if you are aware of this subtlety in the culture it is very easy to set appropriate boundaries that will be respected by the company and leadership team if you dont like where you are in cisco or what you are working on give it 6 months because you will be reorgd while it is sometimes necessary to realign the company to meet competitive threats or market demands reorganizing the company once a year is excessive and tends to create a distrusting environment for the rank and file which makes being a leader in the organize challenging there is a loss of momentum and motivation that occurs a few months before and a few months after reorgs so this leaves the company being effective at delivery and execution only about 70 of the time while cisco attracts some bright motivated people the truth of the matter is you are either cut out for the company and its culture or youre not if you arent it will be painfully obvious to you and those around you sadly as a leader it is hard to cut dead weight from the team and the only really accepted way is via layoffs which is why the company reorgs once a year despite the company line about the reorgs

Hewlett Packard Enterprise | HPE,3,2023-12-26,good company if your college age or connected not 30+,director business development,former employee more than 10 years,"Tampa, FL",perks culture etc is some of the best in the industry,every 1218 months the company undergoes a reorganization aimed at redirecting priorities and reducing costs while skills and performance are cited these reorgs disproportionately target higherpaid veteran employees the real intent is to cut costs not really care about their veteran employees i was with the company for 25 years before being released due to a recent reorg my department lost funding and could not maintain my salary one of the highest due to my tenure no other departments could take on my compensation either this pattern indicates a strategy of replacing experienced skilled employees with entrylevel hires purely to cut costs while legal it systematically pushes out veteran expertise employees should be aware that loyalty and performance may not protect against being cut solely due to higher salaries the company could be more transparent about the financial motivations behind these reorgs and it risks losing critical institutional knowledge and skills while some costcutting may be necessary there are likely better ways to achieve savings while valuing and retaining essential experience

PayPal,1,2024-01-12,extremely challenging and complex,senior software engineer,current employee less than 1 year,,compensation packages are generous especially their rsus and they are friendly to completely remote work,ive been at paypal a relatively short time and so far this is the most challenging job of my life with some very questionable management personally ive never been more stressed or felt as hopeless in any job and support from management is underwhelming the first thing to note is that you likely will not see any of these problems during your interview process the interview questions were fair and somewhat difficult but the experience of working with the engineers was positive everyone i interviewed with was extremely polite patient and knowledgeable and gave me a fantastic initial impression of the company from a technical perspective the internal software architecture of paypal is a mess in addition to being the most siloed organization ive ever seen there are far too many individual services that make up their system this has the side effect of making even the simplest debugging or coding task almost impossible for any new hire from outside of paypal to accomplish regardless of their technical ability without at least several years of paypal proprietary domain knowledge you will be woefully unequipped to deal with most tasks you are given the only preparation you have in this regard is a litany of online documents to review during your first few weeks most of which are very detailed but still cannot give you enough perspective to understand paypals overly complex flows with regard to management despite knowing the complexities mentioned above and how difficult they are to understand for new hires they dont seem to really care when it comes to allocating your tasks you will likely be overloaded with tasks that you clearly arent well equipped to deal with yet and your manager will likely just ask you to handle it anyway on top of this there seems to be a culture of trying to shift blame and kick the can around to different teams for incidents regardless of what the data says

VMware,1,2023-11-28,dont even bother,representante de atencion al cliente,former employee less than 1 year,,the only thing good about this place are the benefits,hearing about all these layoffs makes me really sad for people but i think they should consider it a blessing im so much happier since i left 2 years ago my mental health has greatly improved cons extreme micromanagement by the c level senior staff i had the unfortunate experience of working closely with a clevel executive i was constantly belittled and put down my boss was a former navy seal so they had a particular mindset their way or no way it was extremely toxic and cannot believe i let someone speak to me like that in this day and age they expect you to work past clocked hours also there were constant unexpectedunscheduled calls to my personal cell phone just because i didnt have small children should not give you the permission to call me at 900 at night it was a truly unpleasant experience and the worst job i ever had i knew it was time to go after being told the following youre bad at your job instead of providing constructive criticism $30000 doesnt get me up in the morning the god complex was astounding then they had the audacity to roll their eyes when i spoke about my experience in a meeting with hr extremely rude and unprofessional i hope they see this and know who they are im now with a company that appreciates me and my boss is wonderful
VMware,1,2023-11-03,tragic turn from great to horrible,senior ui developer,current employee more than 3 years,"Palo Alto, CA",vmware was a great company until recently they hired some new people and got into the broadcom acquisition and it all went south really bad pay is still good but that will take a significant hit with broadcom if the deal ever goes through in either case vmware will never be the same,my team is fine the devs i work with both here and remote are pretty good but there is too much to do and not enough people unfortunately i work with the design team doing fed for ui this team was pretty decent until they changed leadership there are now several foul and horrendous people full of phony warmth and a lot of meaningless process designers are burdened with time wasting ux performances that make things hard for them and this trickles down to us i am very proux when it brings value but this does not even worse are the technical people in this group along with being unpleasant full of misery and sadness that turns everything into an unproductive and noncollegial confrontation they also are straight up unqualified i have sat in meetings where these people make embarrassing outright errors make sure anything you do has zero connection with them or you will work in a backstabbing atmosphere of gloom
VMware,2,2023-09-13,low key racist favoritism across the board,sales development representative sdr,current employee more than 3 years,"Boston, MA",benefits are awesome pays pretty decent for the role if youre a remote employee it can be a little more difficult to get your foot off the ground but a lot of flexibility,some of the management shows extreme favoritism they micromanage and they dont like remote employees im only speaking for cloud health and not vmware there is a closet racist at the helm of cloud health they are very abusive when you dont hit your numbers and start to micromanage you they promote their friends and they all hang out together if youre in the boston office management are friends people leave with an a days notice and you never know why they give their friends the best territories and then make it your fault that your territory is not the best even though data shows that that territory needs to be white spaced overall good company but if youre a biopic not the best place unnecessary meetings and gaslighting when you express concerns

VMware,4,2023-12-30,good culture but bad management,staff engineer 1,current employee more than 3 years,"Los Angeles, CA",culture was great as an employee you really felt taken care of with wellness allowances raises and bonuses,often times products and services were unknown to the larger technology industry rather than taking the products to the people the expectation was that the people would come and find the products
VMware,5,2023-09-08,best place i ever worked and broadcom will destroy it,anonymous employee,current employee more than 5 years,,vmware is the best place i have ever worked of course there are always things you could complain about but ultimately vmware pays its employees well treats everybody with respect and encourages employees to develop themselves the company goes out of its way to do nice things for its employees im going to miss vmware and all of the people here once broadcom destroys the culture and lays off 90 of us,its easy to get pigeonholed into a job here but the company will continue to promote and incentivize you financially to stick with it there are a lot of tenured directors and senior directors that are in over their heads good people but are not qualified for director level jobs other than having worked their way up at vmware

VMware,3,2023-10-22,not a visionary company,staff performance engineer,former employee,,vmware is a visionary company in terms of what they are famous for however see my comments about working on a product unrelated to what vmware is known for,vmware is a great company in terms of its primary focus however they also have some products that are out of their mainstream i worked on one of those the management of this group was completely clueless in terms of the industry the competition and the product direction they have no ambition to make a better product instead they were happy to make a little money based on maintenance revenues from legacy customers working in an environment of 2nd and 3rdrate engineers running on autopilot was very frustrating had i known this in advance of joining i would have never signed up

Thomson Reuters,5,2024-02-13,a stellar work environment,assistant manager,current employee more than 5 years,Hyderābād,one of the most remarkable aspects of working at thomson reuters is the unwavering commitment to fostering a healthy worklife balance in an era where the lines between work and personal life can sometimes blur thomson reuters goes above and beyond to ensure that its employees can thrive both professionally and personally whether its through the flexibility of a hybrid work model or the generous leave policies such as flexible work from anywhere extended parental leave and ample annual leave mental health leaves the company truly prioritizes the wellbeing of its employees if youre seeking a workplace where you can grow thrive and make a real difference i wholeheartedly recommend considering thomson reuters thank you thomson reuters for being more than just a company for being a supportive community where every employee is valued and empowered to succeed,communication issues micromanagement favoritism lack of recognition inadequate resources
Thomson Reuters,1,2024-01-23,steer clear unless no other job offer,research analyst,former employee less than 1 year,"London, England",brand recognition thomson reuters is a powerhouse and having it on your cv increases personal brand value career opportunities the size and scope of the firm provide room to move into other business functions decent social life at reuters events for junior and middle management if its your first job join tr and stay for a year for the brand then swiftly move into into something else,strategic oversight issues lack of strategic awareness among senior and middle managers resulting in instances of overpromising and underdelivering eventually most of the team apart from middle and senior managers was made redundant favouritism and potential retaliation the existence of managerial favoritism coupled with a perception that dissenting voices are not welcomed was concerning instances where going against management resulted in active pushback and attempts to sideline an overachieving colleague are particularly troubling questionable handling of disagreements a colleague was targeted by middle and senior management for expressing dissent when offering constructive criticism and presenting differing viewpoints managers tried to push colleagues out of the firm despite the team being made redundant real crappy environment to work in professional development no professional development opportunities beyond what is needed for the product poor compensation belowinflation increases in salaries which impacted overall job satisfaction and motivation

Thomson Reuters,2,2023-11-01,should have left sooner,conference producer,former employee more than 3 years,"London, England",the only pros that i can think of is that the name thomson reuters looks good on your cv so can help you get a better position elsewhere although im not sure how long tr can live off their past grandeur,management have no direction it changed quicker than the wind and we were always left to pick up the pieces senior management is essentially a bunch of cowboys who started working for the company when it was still fcbi straight out of uni and have had no real management or business training the lack of professionalism is unimaginable for anyone who has worked elsewhere all company risk is put on the employer as the vast majority of our pay was based on event commission the events you were given were strongly based on favouritism and often sexism whereby some people continuously were receiving huge commissions the main reason why they have stayed and others get nothing the culture is toxic and full of bullies you are expected to work well beyond contract hours as it is the only way to attempt to make any commission next to no progression people had to almost beg for any sort of promotion and when they finally got the role they were only offered 25k more despite a doubling in responsibility the last 2 pay rises their initial offer was a 2 increase which was around 800 a year given the low salaries to begin with
Thomson Reuters,3,2024-02-12,good company,associate content specialist,current employee more than 1 year,Taguig,they have good and a lot of benefits when you on board approachable teammates and managers,for me the cons the new management i think they tend to do more micro managing unlike before that tend to pressure tenured employees to leave and also regarding promotion even if you work hard if you cant think of any process improvement you will stay on your job role for a very long time it takes to 3 to 5 years to promote an employee

Thomson Reuters,4,2023-09-26,a company that truly cares about its employees,sales development representative sdr,current employee more than 1 year,Hyderābād,thomson reuters is a globally recognized brand known for its commitment to excellence and innovation working here allows me to be part of a prestigious organization with a strong reputation one of the biggest pros of working at thomson reuters is the emphasis on continuous learning and professional growth the company offers a wide range of training and development programs tr promotes diversity and inclusion creating a workplace where individuals from diverse backgrounds are valued and respected this fosters a culture of creativity and collaboration tr values worklife balance and offers flexible work arrangements this helps employees maintain a healthy balance between their professional and personal lives i really appreciate the idea of providing work from anywhere opportunity where you can travel to any location to spend time with your family without affecting your work tr values internal talent and provides opportunities for career advancement employees can grow within the organization overall i am happy to be a part of thomson reuters,competition among employees for promotions or recognition can be intense leading to a potentially stressful work environment while tr invests in technology some employees may face challenges in adapting to new tools and platforms with a global workforce communication across different time zones and languages can sometimes be a barrier to effective collaboration at times while working in sales i have faced a lot of pressure when i was actually looking for some support the fastpaced nature of the financial and legal industries that thomson reuters serves can sometimes create a highpressure work environment which may not be suitable for everyone

Honeywell,4,2024-01-26,good company just be ready for change,offering management,current employee more than 10 years,"Atlanta, GA",fortunate to have had some terrific managers over the years who have been and still are on my personal board of directors our current exec leadership is evolving however while very focused on growth they are listening and engaging our benefits packages are better than most while we are middle of the pack in some areas we do lead in several our employee resource groups create a space for everyone to feel like they belong they offer ways for community engagement and personal betterment very innovative company almost too a fault we are highly invested in rd which can mean you sometimes forget about all the great npi we have made amazing team of employees and friends,all depends on if you are in it for only you or looking at a larger picture there are many in every company who have negative statements about their workplaces if you know that you are going to work for a large global company and think it will be like working at a small family business wake up honeywell is there to make money for their shareholders and that can create a fast paced hard core very direct environment that not everyone can live work in be honest with yourself and know what you are getting into no matter where you decide to work after all it is your decision to accept any all job offers and the associated pay benefits would say that over the past 510 years hr has put us in a very woke system that is broken this is one piece that does need attention or you will run the folks with the ip away

Genpact,3,2023-09-11,pay review,manager,former employee more than 3 years,Bengaluru,the work life balance depends on the account and the type of management running it hence if things are good then you dont get stressed neither are you expected to kill yourself for companys sake junior levels can actually have a good work life balance but as everywhere else as you climb the ladder the learning increases but that may happen at cost of family or personal time,if the account your are part of is not setup correctly then you will be juiced very well in some scenarios its an operation driven decision making while hr is simply on loop hence you may see people getting promoted without clearing minimum criteria industrywise hence internally folks my be holding good designations but once they look out they may get a reality shock also being a captive you are only good as the account you worked for genpact makes people do certain courses on their genome learning platform but they do not publish any certification for the completion of those courses to their employees so many employees are trained on many tools and other domains but cant prove it anywhere due to lack of a certificate there are other account level activities which certain employees take care of but cant showcase it anywhere regarding those experiences except talk about it folks get rewarded through cheers points for such adhoc efforts but again there is no written recognition given to employees also the 90 days notice period is indirectly an entrapment which forces many never to leave or take huge risk and resign with no offer in hand

Seagate Technology,2,2023-06-13,great work terrible execs,senior staff engineer,current employee more than 10 years,"Longmont, CO",the work itself is a lot of fun fellow employees are great the technology is very interesting and engaging to work on the scale and scope of the technology and manufacturing process is decidedly cool the problems the company faces are measured in angstroms and dppm and it has the capability of measuring both extremely well the worklife balance is a mixed experience overall the company is run by people who value working 60+ hours a week and being on call 247 but theres space for existing here at a more appropriate rate for your health and wellbeing people generally understand that we all have family responsibilities and that a healthy body is critical for a productive mind,executives are enforcing yes man tendencies and getting routinely blindsided the company broke export laws and was fined 300m the executives cut 300m in employee salary to cover the costs which has netted a 30 employee reduction in the last 6 months the company leadership isnt taking ownership of their responsibility for that decision employee wages are getting cut to fund stock dividend payments the company budget for employee wages is now approximately 13rd the company budget for stock dividends promotions are drastically suppressed and when they do happen are either made because the person in question is politically well established or its made out of desperation to retain employees there is a chronic lack of vision about retaining and growing talent and leadership in an increasingly close to retirement age population critical departments are chronically understaffed and when they do manage to pick up a competent or exceptional new hire they quickly leave due to lack of career progression timelines for programs are so compressed that innovation is suppressed lack of personnel in critical departments is suppressing innovation lack of investment into innovation gets turned into poor management decisions when it comes time that we need massive changes risk tolerance is a bizarre mixture of extreme aversion to change and totally impervious to potential downsides

NTT Ltd.,3,2023-06-27,lot of churn lot of inefficiency but good flexibility,client architect,current employee,,they offer a good worklife balance and give you good flexibility at least at the midtier engineering talent level pay can be competitive you also get a good amount of exposure to different technologies and meet a lot of different clients,you rarely make the bonus which is a large portion of the compensation package a lot of inefficiencies in the organizational combined with rigid corporate structure can make it frustrating to get anything meaningful done constant corporate restructuring due to the merging of several companies over the past 5 yearsish has caused a lot of instability in job positions too much of a focus on sales instead of innovation which i guess could be a pro if you have a sales based compensation package

HubSpot,2,2024-02-06,unmet potential hubspots vision falters in the shadows of a fractured culture,business systems analyst,former employee more than 1 year,"Cambridge, MA",hubspot has a great overall compensation package amenities and resources for employees the framework for greatness exists and with the right leadership i believe the envisioned excellence will be attained,while hubspot flaunts a truly impressive compensation package topnotch amenities and ample resources theres an underlying sense that the organization is yet to realize its full potential regrettably hubspot appears to be a mere shell of the oncerumored 2 best place to work the initially touted culture serves as a tantalizing facade to lure in top talent but as the veneer fades a toxic underbelly of highperformance becomes increasingly apparent what may seem like ones unbridled cynicism postrecruitment and during the theatrics of employee orientation soon reveals itself as a stark reality over time in my brief twoyear tenure i witnessed an alarming level of turnover layoffs and burnout surpassing the cumulative experiences of my multidecade career remarkable individual contributors and stellar managers struggled against the tide their efforts to foster an authentic company culture often thwarted exceptional leaders and contributors were at times driven away by the tenured and toxic gatekeepers resulting in a very disheartening overall experience
HubSpot,3,2023-12-04,aes be advised terminated before my 1yr,account executive,former employee less than 1 year,,hubspot is a worldclass leader in crmmarketingsales software and has really created a phenomenal platform as well as marketing strategy for the platform 1 platform in the industry so youve got a great platform to sell overall great company culture despite the way my journey ended,i started in january 2023 and was terminated the week after thanksgiving 2023 we all know tech sales have been a real challenge in 2023 but my experience at hubspot may have prompted an exit from saas altogether if we look at it from a numbers game i was terminated at 86 attainment i was strugglinghad been for months when i joined i was told inbound should cover approximately 4050 of quota and the rest would be outbound the reality 1020 each month it was an uphill climb from day one i know many reps who are also struggling and are looking for their next role elsewhere i was anticipating starting pip in december i had joined a salestech coaching group meeting w my manager 2xweek meeting w highperformers and coming at it from every single angle i knew how all while it was taking an enormous toll on my mental health instead of pip hr joined my 11 with my manager and i was promptly let go i admittedly wasnt super successful but this was a really disappointing way to leave a company after i had invested so much time and energy and i never got a pip to try to turn things around
HubSpot,2,2024-01-18,used to be a best place to work,senior account executive,current employee more than 5 years,,the product is best in class the business outlook is fine as of now,hubspot really was a best place to work at one time those of us who were there were lucky to have experienced that i could write out a lot here but it really boils down to my experience is that hubspot cares about its employees and customers about as much as your average large corporation its not the worst place to work but its not an amazing place to work anymore in my opinion on average employees seem a little unhappy and a bit disconnected from the mission there are a lot of arbitrary kpis to make up for lack of contextexperience in some of leadership many who are coming from outside of hubspot and in my experience dont necessarily understand what goes into the jobs of those around them my experience is that you have to be ruthless or cutthroat to be successful cash compensation is on the lower end and there are many upcoming changes
HubSpot,2,2024-01-24,it went downhillfast,anonymous employee,former employee more than 3 years,,,i worked at hubspot precovid the energy and support i felt from other hubspotters way back when was amazing it got the company through the hard early days of lockdown then the surge in business that came right after we supported each other through the good and the bad heart wasnt just a culture slogan but how most hubspotters approached each other and their customers but then something changed high performance culture came in another way of saying well get rid of anyone for any reason we want no more trying to lift up your fellow hubspotter and supporting each other through challenges and tough times micromanagement took over and the vibe turned to survivor so many long time employees and leaders have left the company recently its become like any other big software company
HubSpot,2,2024-02-17,high expectations,finance,current employee more than 1 year,"Indianapolis, IN",the stock based compensation is a great benefit,even though they are full remote and offer unlimited pto i am never able to take time off i have even had my manager decline a vacation request during a non busy work time i am unable to have appointments during the workday because my manager schedules meeting over them or constantly slacks me during the appointment she also slacks me at all hours of the day there is no work life balance the expectation is you are on the clock 247 and must be available at all time another con is the promotion process is extremely slow if you want to get promoted even if your manager agrees be prepared to have to prove it over three performance cycles and document extremely high performance
HubSpot,1,2024-01-17,overly focused on race and gender identity,senior software engineer,current employee more than 1 year,"Cambridge, MA",the pay was pretty good,its incredibly difficult to get promoted unless youre a women or have a diverse gender identity then its incredibly easy apparently thats not problematic at all they even brag about having over 50 women in leadership positions that includes trans women and thats how they do it the ceo also female admits theyre doing it on purpose and even makes public company blog posts and posts on women empowerment job sites about how they do it completely oblivious to their bigotry and misandry when the woman team lead with only 4 years of junior level experience stepped down because it was too hard they immediately promoted another woman with only 2 years of full experience who proceeded to ruin every project our team got due to lack of experience even though i had 8 years of experience i was never even asked or considered for a promotion in that area i found another job pretty quickly im currently at the team lead level in a texas based company one that is not overly woke
HubSpot,3,2023-08-28,great company needs better management,account executive,former employee more than 1 year,"Chicago, IL",its a great company with great benefits truly i loved the culture and felt that they cared about their employees very different from previous employers there are plenty of oneoff benefits that actually made me feel valued when i exceeded quota my manager sent me a nice bottle of champagne which really made me feel valued compensation is fair for the role and commission structure is very clear no concerns about being cheated out of what you earned ramp is a full year so it gives you time to learn the product and get comfortable with the role truthfully its an enjoyable and welcoming place to work the people are the best and i made real friends there despite the wfh environment,a lottttt of meetings i spent almost 2 hours a day in internal meetings truly a waste of time and annoying management also needs some work the sales managers take way too much time off and dont really take the time to support their team my manager specifically was out for a total of 3 months throughout the one year i was there it was truly shocking unrealistic expectations youll be hired for an inbound sales role then will never receive a single lead fyi im fine selling ob but to be hired for one role and receive a salary for that role then not receive the tools for it seems wild
HubSpot,1,2024-02-18,the company has gone downhill since the layoff in 2023,software engineer,current employee more than 5 years,"Cambridge, MA",it used to be a good company until the layoff,2022 they said they are not going to lay off anybody the finance looked good then they laid off 7 of their workforce in 2023 2024 comes the company morale was at their lowest they said there wont be another layoff then they laid off bunch of ux designers and katie burke and bunch of hr people around her left i bet the company told her to leave or something
HubSpot,2,2024-02-06,used to love but steadily getting worse and no longer recommend,anonymous employee,current employee more than 3 years,,the remotehybrid culture is fine here but this isnt enough to recommend the company to others,when i joined hubspot several years ago i had heard great things and felt strongly aligned with the culture of the company it felt like they didnt just talk the talk however over the past few years it feels like it has become the epitome of toxic positivity they continue to use their culture code to explain things like consistent reductions decrease in benefits lowered performance reviews etc i havent even been hugely impacted myself by these but its disappointing to see and its made worse by leadership speaking as if were watching a ted talk in addition there are some really shameful dib changes that have disappointed me hugely for instance on my team every single person who has been let go has been a person of color speaking with management about disability accommodations during covid spikes was a terrible experience i know from fellow coworkers that there is truly disappointing treatment of parents on parental leave my own personal experience as a marginalized employee has been so bad that if i had the resources and time i would have moved forward with an employment discrimination lawyer but at this point id rather just get out the company feels like a sinking ship with constant scaling back of benefits roles compensation equity etc theres no oversight of individual managers and it feels like every time theres a company announcement it doesnt land with the broader company
HubSpot,3,2024-01-15,rolling a bit downhill at least for sales,small business account executive,current employee more than 3 years,"Cambridge, MA",great product you can believe in,huge changes these past couple of years general vibe at the moment is that it feels like like the glory days of selling at hubspot at past us they used to brag and celebrate how much they worked into rep attainment number of reps at p club and worklife balance all of that has dropped away almost entirely and they only seem to be taking steps further to go towards the culture of any other large corp business out there still a great place to work but far off the best place to work status of the past imo
HubSpot,2,2023-11-30,uncomfortable culture poor management,senior software engineer,former employee,"Cambridge, MA",the pay and benefits are competitive and there is opportunity to work remotely for those preferring remote work the office is in an easily accessible walkable location and is well equipped with amenities,the company is very aggressive and heavy handed with its culture which is very political and very far left radical to provide a more welcoming and constructive environment for all of its employees politics should and traditionally were kept out of the office but not so at hubspot regarding team dynamics teams are set up to look good on paper but managers are focused on completing rituals and voicing slogans while being indifferent to the progress and success of employees or else being too afraid of confrontation to actually make expectations clear supervisors have no interest in training new staff on company resources and company paradigms and merely wish to insert staff as cogs in the machine rather than preparing them for excellence and a greater contribution there also appear to be higher management schemes to fish for justification to push employees out of the company as a backdoor approach to layoffs rather than being straightforward
HubSpot,1,2024-02-07,warning smoke mirrors ahead,anonymous employee,former employee,,individual contributors are deeply passionate about their work and play a vital role in preserving the founders vision and values the company used to be an exceptional workplace under the guidance of brian and dharmesh,since the onset of covid19 and the transition in clevel leadership the companys guiding principles have shifted from one aimed at building a legacy our grandchildren would admire to fostering a culture of rapid turnover prioritizing perception over substance its crucial to remain vigilant and cautious under these circumstances
HubSpot,2,2023-07-25,cliquey club,manager,current employee more than 3 years,,leadership is very transparent and humble often recognizing areas they need to improve and actually taking steps to improve them they are not afraid to admit where theyve gotten something wrong there are some excellent new leaders that we have brought in product that have great expertise maturity and empathy im excited to see what they can do great pto hs also does a great job of supporting big life moments good and bad i really appreciate the human touch and empathy the company takes here lots of cons but some of these are pervasive in tech and not unique to hs sadly,hubspot is like a high school clique where those that are insiders are protected and promoted often at the expense of more skilled smarter mature and more empathetic leaders if you dont fit in to the hs way you wont go anywhere and the hs way at least in product often favors the men that have been here a long time and are now at the top see the other brave reviewers here that have spoken out about how hs treats people with differing opinions styles etc we also vastly undervalue design and this seems to be getting worse by the day we hire such talented designers and then dont give them the room or voice to lend their expertise over the past year the amount of autonomy of teams has dissipated while this is to be expected as a company scales some parts of this org now have highly paid smart and skilled ics and middle managers who are basically just executing on the orders from people at the very top again beware if you voice a different opinion
HubSpot,3,2023-12-08,camaraderie,customer support specialist,former employee more than 3 years,"Cambridge, MA",during the time i worked for hubspot there was still a startup environment feel to it lots of opportunities to move around try out projects fun creative perks and a seemingly progressive and fun office culture stacked with outings celebrations etc its shifted to a more corporate structure in recent years but i ultimately left discouraged that after readying myself with the right skills and experience internally via collaborative businessminded projects outside of my core role i continually was rejected for new roles i interviewed for 5 different attempts,its shifted to a more corporate structure in recent years but i ultimately left discouraged that after readying myself with the right skills and experience internally via collaborative businessminded projects outside of my core role i continually was rejected for new roles i interviewed for 5 different attempts
HubSpot,1,2024-01-31,do not do customer support at hubspot they absolutely do not care about you,customer support specialist,current employee more than 3 years,"Cambridge, MA",unlimited pto remoteflex work decent health insurance,if you think getting a job in support is a way to get into the company think again the next door is locked they seldom promote from within the support team and when they do they parade it around like a youtuber giving $50 to a homeless man they like to talk about appreciation and mental health and career growth but make no effort to provide any opportunities for those things they will strait up lie to you and then punish you for calling out the lie look at how many other people in the company say they would absolutely never do the job that support does or allow themselves to be treated the way support does last year they laid off 500 people 7 of the company spread evenly across all departments but some how it was just under half of the support team we spend the whole year struggling under heavy volume and all they did was demand more then get upset when we took time off because it was getting to be too much i cannot stress enough do not apply to this job there are plenty of similar roles with similar pay and benefits that wont leave you so stressed out that you need to see a therapist dont believe the crap about this being a great place to work it was under halligan but for the support team at least this has not been a even a good place to work for a long time and they absolutely dont care
HubSpot,1,2024-01-22,fake care = liberal culture pronouns corporate slavery,mid market account executive,current employee more than 1 year,,if you like playing the corporate game putting work first in your life and hit increasing quotas then yes you will have work life balance but only when things are going well,if youre not hitting quota even if youve had a great track record previously the personal things going on in your life will not be cared about and youll be disposed of or pressured to leave diversity means liberal diversity aka pronouns voting democrat etc forcing african americans to take the vaccine at the same time as saying you care for american americans is wild
HubSpot,2,2024-01-12,was great increasingly terrible,ux researcher,current employee more than 3 years,,pay is good colleagues are generally nice smart work is challenging,leadership is taking on more of a faang tech mentality and doing it poorly at that micromanagement is on the rise no psychological safety firing some of the best people and replacing them with mediocrity an environment of malaise has been created more managers than are necessary no one around me is happy at work anymore it wasnt always like this
HubSpot,3,2024-02-16,layoffs,recruiter,former employee,"Boston, MA",the remote culture was actually solid,the way the company handled the layoffs was not great decent severance though

HubSpot,2,2023-06-08,a complete change in culture for the worse,finance,current employee,,ability to work fully remote compensation is pretty good sabbatical after five years,in the past year or so the culture at hubspot has taken a complete nosedive there has been a total exodus of highly tenured knowledgeable people across so many departments who had been with the company for many years and held so much knowledge it seems most everyone you now meet has been here under 2 years which should tell you something leadership keeps joining from major fortune 500 companies and along with it they have brought the toxic cultures they continue benchmarking to the market which basically means doing away with the benefits and culture that made hubspot special and different from the typical corporation that treated you as just a number worklife balance was terrible to begin with and was made worse after the layoffs constant communications via emails and slack at all hours of the day and everything is somehow an emergency that needed to be completed yesterday people are already on the edge of burnout yet somehow were now pushing this new high performance culture that hr and leadership have barely been able to articule and explain what exactly it means

HubSpot,5,2023-11-17,phenomenal company to work for,principal business analyst,current employee more than 3 years,"New York, NY",hubspot is the best company ive ever worked for hands down theyre transparent in their communication flexible in their working time and time off and generous in their compensation but above all you get to work with smart talented people every day who genuinely enjoy their jobs plus i have full confidence in the companys future success,unlimited pto can sometimes be difficult to navigate because its been marketed as a benefit i have used it to its full extentand most people do but ive also received push back from managers when it might not be a good time to go on vacation fwiw i would prefer a company policy that strictly outlines the number of vacation days we can use but hubspot stillon averagenavigates these situations well

HubSpot,1,2023-08-31,used to be great,customer service representative,current employee more than 1 year,,unlimited pto as long as you have done enough tickets for the month good benefits great people,things just keep getting harder we are building a high performance culture and just dont have the support needed for this it is causing so much burn out biggest issue for me is growth they put barriers in place to prevent growth if you get a sometimes meets expectations on a performance review you can not apply for internal positions for 6 months even if the role has nothing to do with the internal position even if the hiring manager doesnt care in my case i am not the best customer service rep im finally hitting metrics but because i struggle with customer service i cant apply for a software dev job even though the skills are completely different to me this is judging a fish on its ability to climb help people get to positions that their skill sets allow them to succeed i want to like my job and i used to love it here if management would be willing to work with me this would be a different story but they wont do anything i know our chief people officer reads these if you want to help say the word and i will reach out
HubSpot,1,2023-04-05,used to be great downward snowball since 2022 freefall in 2023,anonymous employee,former employee more than 3 years,,you get a middling job that will pay the bills and work remotely that will give you an excuse to hide from disrespectful or moderately competent coworkers you get to work against other teams and compete to be better than all the rest the best like no one ever was you might get to work with a leader that doesnt assign you the same task also assigned to several others unbeknownst to you you can take unlimited vacation and fall behind your coworkers on their way to a promotion before you even though you completed everything in good order you get a high chance of taking on work that will not get recognized because the leader that designed the project was confused and cant understand if theres any business value you might still have some of the benefits advertised by the time you start you might have a chance to switch teams or move internally if leadership thinks a new shiny title and rebranding an existing role are important in the next year,this is a complete bureaucracy now any merit based teams are few and far between those teams are also probably not hiring as they are being forced to conform or actively being managed out by being given unrealistic expectations culture teamwork and comradery are all rapidly declining as teams feel pit against each to produce
HubSpot,5,2023-12-14,have loved it,account executive,current employee,,hubspot has surpassed all of my expectations i am genuinely delighted with my team manager and the company culture it is truly invigorating to be a part of such an amazing organization,continuing to put the customer first ive noticed that on the cs side of things we could be doing more to support our customers
HubSpot,1,2023-08-07,toxicity behind a smile and orange paint,software engineer,former employee more than 1 year,,,ive worked at the company as both an intern for multiple periods 2018 2019 and as a full timer from 20202023 and i can attest to the very negative turn in culture at this company i raised concerns about my manager which were ignored by upper leadership and it resulted in multiple retaliations an internal whistleblower investigation and ultimately short after the investigations conclusion was let go although they made it a point to let me know they do not retaliate against employees who file whistleblower complaints if you are neurodivergent not ablebodied a person of color a woman etc my strong recommendation would be to avoid this company like the plague if you do not conform you will be sidelined and most likely let go eventually i know of a few former employees that have really bad interactions with this company behind close door please be careful and consider other options
HubSpot,3,2023-09-20,wish it ended differently,anonymous employee,current employee more than 1 year,,hubspots culture offers a myriad of appealing qualities some of which include a strong emphasis on autonomy and ownership at least on certain teams the organization has demonstrated an openness to remote work options for virtually all employees allowing for flexibility in terms of work hours and styles my colleagues were by and large truly exceptional working alongside such talented and remarkable colleagues was a valuable experience and i had the privilege of forming enduring friendships with many of them while the compensation didnt reach the heights of faanglevel packages it was quite competitive additionally the inclusion of unlimited paid time off was a notable perk,in light of the shifting economic landscape the organizational culture has undergone a notable transformation what was once characterized by autonomy and trust has evolved into a situation marked by increased micromanagement and a prevailing sense of apprehension the companys emphasis on cultivating a highperformance culture has resulted in a proliferation of performance improvement plans terminations and layoffs despite prior assurances from executive leadership that every possible measure would be taken to prevent such outcomes while some layoffs ostensibly were performancebased others affected individuals who had never received unfavorable performance evaluations or been provided an opportunity to rectify any deficiencies following the layoffs several of these individuals have been informed that they are ineligible for rehire even as many of the previously eliminated positions have been reposted and new hires made it is the perceived lack of transparency that proves most disconcertingasserting that the layoffs were objective and driven by the fact that positions were no longer needed only to promptly replace those who were let go id have preferred to be told directly that it was based on performance at least be transparent furthermore amidst the escalating trend of micromanagement affecting lowerlevel employees there seems to be a conspicuous dearth of oversight when it comes to the actions of top leaders ineffectual management goes unnoticed and unaddressed and clear favoritism exists granting a select few an audience even when their perspective may be misguided or based on inaccurate information
HubSpot,5,2024-01-08,great place to work,business systems analyst,current employee,,great company culture with really smart folks,none for me great place
HubSpot,1,2024-01-09,lack of transparency lack of empathy,senior software engineer,current employee more than 3 years,,unlimited pto work life balance,managers are unqualified and inflated they will make up problems to justify cost cutting and other issues
HubSpot,2,2023-08-08,mixed culture,director,current employee more than 1 year,,customer focused company with interesting problems to solve,the so called heart is mosty talk not consistent humble and empahty is only when you are in the circle of the leadership or if you are within product org you are treated well if you are not part of product team and trying to collaborate with them you are excluded also theres no empowerment of decisions leadership review 100 pages of slides for each review meeting and tons of data and almost every business decisions need c level review and approval theres no structure and process leaders talk about automation as priority but the problem starts with accountability and process when those are not clear every department is trying to fight their way to prove their value by stepping into other function or peoples area no work life balance people at senior leadership level openly say theres only work life flexibility
HubSpot,4,2023-08-16,great company product quite complex,senior customer success manager,current employee less than 1 year,,pay culture benefits and time off pto global week of rest create your own schedule autonomy,started out leading calls with vps 6 weeks in while knowing next to nothing about the intricacies of the product the training to this point was largely emotion based the customers knowledge of the product ranges from next to nothing if they werent using it big red flag hah to having a mastered it the types of questions that consistently come up on calls and via email lead to me sifting through many many slack channels in desperate attempt for answers i receive lots of support from my manager and peers but often the questions are so complex that ill receive 10 wiki resources and or get on a call with a coworker that ends up being an hour long great company but be prepared for this
HubSpot,2,2023-09-18,failure to scale effectively culture not what it was,finance,current employee,,still a strong growth company decent pay internal mobility remote work,hubspot was once truly a great place to work worthy of the prior accolades unfortunately as the company has scaled there have been a number of growing pains and its now just slightly better than another company at least in the finance department working long hours is demanded in order to be successful forcing trade offs in your personal life a once strong team culture has been replaced with a toxic one led by outside hires who have pushed out long tenured members of the team pressure to deliver against unrealistic expectations is at an all time high and empathy is nowhere to be found
HubSpot,1,2023-12-03,buyer beware,software engineer,former employee more than 1 year,"Boston, MA",i do not have any,feels like the company grew way too fast and everyone is scrambling to try and figure things out i felt like just number there because there are so many people lots of inexperienced managers and directors lots of software parts are abstracted away from the engineer so not a good place to learn how things actually work company is great at feel good marketing internally but reality is very different

HubSpot,2,2023-08-16,hire and fire huge new rep turnover rate,corporate account executive,current employee more than 1 year,,worldclass product the product really is the best on the market flexibility in building custom packages for customers with products and pricing customers know and love the product and often bring it from company to company with them in general i have a ton of hope for hubspot and there are some really amazing people there however there is a lot to improve on im writing this review bc i wish i had seen one like it before i joined if you are coming from a salesforce are super organized and land on the right team with a good territory you will be great,you are very unlikely to make it out of your first year of ramp of my hiring class almost 50 were put on a pip andor fired the managers have an actual incentive to continue to bring on new reps while pippingfiring under 1 year reps to keep their team number low while they send good leads to tenured reps they provide very little training managers do not have a ton of product knowledge and there is no formal training program lots of noise and unfocused strategy strategy seems last minute and ad hoc crm data is a mess this was a major shock for me because it adds an insane amount of admin work on your plate think old contacts duplicate records and records that dont connect to our actual customer database they ask you to hit prospecting metrics with extremely few tools and a messy crm which makes it super frustrating territories are unfair reps who have been there for 2+ years know every trick in the book and have bloated books of businesses by skirting around rules managers pass leads to tenured reps leadership protects managers who churn through new reps they say its a mishirebut its really just bad or poorly trained managers straddling the fence between a true enterprise org and a smbmidmarket org they expect you to be running small transactional deals while executing complex deals with 10+ team member deal teams this is nearly impossible with the amount of time in the day messy crm data metric expectations ie calls emails activities and tasks and internal meetings there are a ton vp of sales says we are on quarterly quota when you are actually on monthly quota the sales cycle length is quarterly you can hit your yearly and quarterly numbers and be fired on missing a month very little team culture there are some amazing tenured reps that are willing to help but there are few and far inbetween most reps are just trying to get by and have their heads down and are unwilling to help
HubSpot,5,2023-04-17,amazing culture where you are genuinely valued,senior product designer i,current employee less than 1 year,,the people culture and genuine care for employees is everything it was touted to be and more there is a reason hubspot is at the top of glassdoor and other job transparency sites and i have loved it here so far the diversity training and first week onboarding was the best onboarding training i have done with any company and that can be difficult to do remotely your health and wellbeing is genuinely important to others here and you can feel it and it creates a great culture of taking care of each other the perks and benefits are also excellent,the only con i have ran into is that in my particular area processes are a bit loosely defined for such a large company its not a problem if you are a gogetter and like to figure things out for yourself which i am but i would have expected more clearly defined processes to help newhires understand what is expected and the steps taken to get to the same result everyone seems to be doing their own methods which is fine but that can create inconsistency with end results and doesnt work as well when scaling a team or onboarding new hires hubspot does seem to know this however and i have already seen initiatives in place to start creating bettermore defined processes

HubSpot,3,2023-09-04,goodbye old friend not the same hubspot,anonymous employee,former employee more than 5 years,"Cambridge, MA",excellent phenomenal products customers and partners live and breath this product and the ecosystem is strong marketing and sales particularly have exceptional strength in the market the culture built by dharmesh and brian was incredible but eventually every employee became a victim cant keep hrbps because the victim volume incredibly high,woke inc unfortunately for all of the diversity and inclusion hubspot espouses it is the antithesis of inclusive when it comes to welcoming nonliberal points of view csuite determine new customers based on slack channel crowdsourcing to ensure they dont hurt employees feelings everyone is offered an abortion as they please without any sense that various countries and religions take offense employees with differing views are shunned and the internal liberal echo chamber is loud separately the layoffs were a mess top performers with highest marks were let go and their managers had no idea after ceo said we arent doing layoffs people with many years at the company under their belt with families cut with no reason intense metric based micromanagement has created a world of cut throat cover your neck and throw anyone you can under the bus the mission the passion and the camaraderie is gone as an ethos across the employee base employees all on an island with no support to connect with others irl pay significantly lower than core competitors
HubSpot,2,2023-06-09,used to be a great place to work,customer support specialist,current employee more than 1 year,"Boston, MA",decent salary for the postion compared to other job offers on the market good health insurance,since hubspot understaffed support via the 7 workforce reduction earlier this year and this short staffing has been further exacerbated by massive attrition since hubspots culture has shifted dramatically leadership doesnt care about experience seniority or history of loyalty in employees all that matters now is your production numbers this month there is no context that can explain low numbers and no compassion for employees i personally know a mentortype person with years of experience who was cut loose in recent months after their numbers dropped due to stress caused by their move across the country and the general burnout culture we work in 40 hours a week everyone i know is leaving as quickly as possible this ship is sinking while on fire

foodpanda,2,2024-01-14,very very unstable,food delivery rider,former employee less than 1 year,"Pasir Panjang, ",frontline workers not a very useful writeup in a resume as this field is completely different from most typical job offers experience wouldnt be valued as much however companies may hire these workers due to their adaptability to a different environment etc would leave foodpanda as they dont feel that its worth it to contribute their time to this job as the returns are not much and they would find other job prospects,frontline workers delivery riders have to learn about how they have to do their job on their own without coaching they have to check up on their own wellness and do their own reports in the app only given directions on how to collect food at stores by a certain time period they are expected to double check on items then they are expected to just deliver to certain places based on the map projections on the app however in this case it does have directions to follow no coaching on how to engage with customers either drivers are expected to communicate to customers politely even if they dont know how to do so expected to know how to take clear and proper photos of food items and delivery locations sometimes there are other scenarios that riders are not prepared for like being forced to take 2 orders at 1 time or restaurants taking too long to prepare the food not much growth opportunities here mainly just social skills and geographical skills the tasks are always strongly correlated to each other without much variety and is extremely repetitive
foodpanda,3,2024-02-17,a career stepping stone but not worth staying at,associate,former employee more than 1 year,,the worklife balance is great especially because its a hybrid setup tho the workload and job quality in general really depends on the team and your manager its fun working here,theyll really lowball your salary the also did mass layoffs twice or thrice in one year in addition your supervisor or manager can also have 4x your pay even though they arent really working nor taking care of their team my advise is to look for other companies but if you need the experience and work life balance then you can try it out

Expedia Group,2,2023-10-28,bad management,anonymous employee,current employee more than 3 years,"Los Angeles, CA",great benefits unlimited pto work life balance,ive been with this company for quite some time now and its safe to say that a lot has changed since i first walked through those doors its been a journey filled with ups and downs and id like to share my perspective lets start with the positives if youre fortunate enough to have a good manager consider yourself lucky they can be your guiding light in an organization that often seems to have lost its way however the management style in general tends to lean heavily towards micromanagement which can be stifling and counterproductive at times its hard to thrive when you constantly feel like someone is looking over your shoulder pushing you for more even when youre already outperforming your peers one of the most significant issues ive observed is the sheer number of initiatives the company pursues simultaneously while ambition is admirable it often feels like a scattered approach where resources and attention are spread too thin it can be challenging to excel in an environment where youre expected to juggle so many tasks and it sometimes feels like a lack of clear direction furthermore theres been a noticeable shift in the companys priorities we used to have a budget allocated for partner meetings and inoffice engagement which contributed to a sense of camaraderie and motivation however thats no longer the case despite the companys financial success its disheartening to see such perks vanish when the company is more prosperous than ever it leaves employees feeling undervalued and disconnected from the companys overall success in conclusion working for this company has been a mixed experience the presence of a good manager can make all the difference but the prevailing micromanagement style an overwhelming number of initiatives and the loss of budget for partner meetings and inoffice engagement have made the journey a challenging one the company seems to be in transition and it remains to be seen whether these changes will lead to a more positive work environment in the future

Expedia Group,3,2023-09-13,great people shortsighted management,technical writer,former employee more than 1 year,"Seattle, WA",,pay is lower than you would expect compared to other tech companies i was never really given an honesttogoodness onboarding experience opting for a sink or swim approach where i was just immersed in the work and trusted to figure it out as a result i never learned basic things like how do i found out who to talk to about x and was later chastised for not knowing these things when i hadnt been given any guidance expectations are often unclear when i asked about criteria for promotion i was provided a very vague skills matrix but told that this is going to change soon so dont get too hung up on it it was going to change soon for six months and i never saw it change i would often not find out that i had missed the mark somewhere or was not meeting an expectation until a month or more after the fact which it is much harder to adjust and correct when i raised to my manager that i felt some of these things were coming out of the blue i was told weve been having these conversations consistently about topics that had literally never come up in any of our conversations when i tried to raise this concern up the chain i was told well communication is complicated and not given any assurances anything would be done about it after my departure eg is pushing an absolutely nonsensical return to office policy even if none of your teammates or none of the people who requisition work from your team are based in your location you are still expected to come into the office 50 of the time that 50 seems to be an entirely arbitrary number picked out of the air to please shareholders not based in any kind of analysis or fact this wouldnt be so bad if the office was actually a good place to work but the office culture is severely lacking in organization or basic etiquette desks and chairs are ergonomically awful with 80 of them facing directly toward exterior windows so glare is a constant issue desks are firstcome firstserve during the day so if you dont arrive bright and early you are stuck with a nonadjustable desk that means youre uncomfortable all day long despite the existence of conference rooms and phone booths people often take zoom calls right from their desk including two people at side by side desks jumping into the same zoom call this is a common occurrence because as a global company even if everyone on a team is in an office they wont be in the same office so theyre conducting all their business remotely anyway the end result is doing the same work you do at home in a less comfortable desk with worse equipment and more distractions of course nobody wore a mask as of early 2023 and you would get weird looks in the halls for wearing one exceptions to the inoffice policy are only given out for physical health reasons and even then mostly only on a temporary basis if you dont wish to come into the office for mental health reasons to say nothing of the basic practicality as outlined above the official company line is see a therapist and suck it up this is to say nothing of the fact that in october of 2022 they removed any kind of vaccination requirement to come into the office so you cant even trust that the people around you are vaccinated against covid leadership seems to be charging through all of this with oblivious aplomb when the office first opened peter kern released a message to employees telling them that it was option and if anyone didnt want to come in for any reason including youre just not comfortable doing it you would not be made to at some point this message was quietly discarded and the policy changed from 50 to 50 not counting monday and friday eventually expedia weeks were instituted where a week every quarter would require everyone to come in all five days this resulted in chaos long lines for all food and drink options and special events that could not handle this capacity no collaboration or increased productivity took place but leadership smiled and insisted it was a success every candid conversation i had with a fellow employee made it clear that these policies are wildly unpopular with everyone except the highest level of management or those who have thoroughly drank the koolaid the result is an environment where i dont feel like my needs are taken into account whatsoever

Concentrix,2,2023-10-10,fast pace environment,customer service representative,former employee more than 1 year,"Dublin, Dublin",salary is always on time wfh is great my team was the best,kpi to get monthly bonus in the hands of customers makes 0 sense if they are unhappy about the resolution that you give according to policy they will give you 1 out of 5 and your voc will drop drastically you are told to start at 8 and go online but when its time to log off you have to do it 2 minutes after your log off time because we have to wait for the queue to be clear imagine an incoming call that comes in those 2 minutes and youre on the phone for half an hour that means if you had something else to do like living the rest of your life youre late you cant you cant take your 10 minutes personal time in the last hour of your shift for some unspecified reason the breaks are tightly scheduled which for a job based on incoming calls is unthinkable if your break is at 10 am and you receive a call at 958 you have to wait for the call to end before taking your 15 minutes anyway so whats the point of scheduling them sometimes between 2 breaks there are 354 hours on an 8hour shift to progress in your career you have to stay in the same role for at least one year other factor for promotion is if you constantly get the bonus by reaching kpi so if youre good on calls you will be promoted off the calls

NEC Corporation,1,2014-05-31,not a happy place,anonymous employee,current employee,,nec offers a mix of research and development some groups may be more focused on business needs and thus spend most of their time on development,high turn around rate people rarely stay more than 2 years initially people may be attracted by the research or rd but soon realize that this is not a very productive research environment if you group is controlled by manager who is completely incompetent it will stifle all progress or research cant generalize this to all groups but i have seen similar things happen more often than not senior management essentially roger although nice is practically useless not much collaboration is going on the culture is quite backwardish for example working on weekends is praised it is apparently acceptable to scold or shame employees long and useless meetings are held in which the manager or occasionally roger talk endlessly not much not any growth opportunities pay is not competitive for fulltime employees
NEC Corporation,3,2011-01-13,classic good ol boy environment,reporting directly to general manager,former employee,"Irving, TX",large company perks for most employees mostly nice offices and respectful environment the parking was covered and the basic support systems were nothing to brag about but reasonable,management style and incompetence straight from the 1950s it was surprising how many of the senior level executives turned a blind eye to gross misuse of company money some of the major boondoggles were beyond the pale flying 1st class on company money and hosting party meals for dozens of friends is not in itelf a bad thing however misrepresenting the purpose andor need destroys upper managements credibility and brings its character into question
NEC Corporation,2,2014-04-12,better stay away or you will regret,anonymous employee,former employee,,relaxed environment flexible schedule quiet place to think about things,its not that this place is so bad its the opportunity you will be missing that will cost you this review is based on my personal experience in a particular group i dont think every group is the same so ask observe and do your research about a group first of all this place is called a research lab but its barely one some people when they decide to forget about financial gains will come back to this later and join a research lab want to publish papers and build up an academic profile if you are one of those people think twice about joining this place especially some groups look at if any of the recent departures from the group went to a place youd like to be if the odds is against you there is probably a good reason there you may be different but you will still be constrained by the lab you will probably get much less research and much more development than you thought freedom of research is more often just used to entice you to join after you join you will likely be assigned something your manager tell you very critical for the company and you have to do it for those who really wants to do academic research its much better to find a postdoc position with a great mentor i know you will sacrifice a little financially but the long term gain will be worthwhile plus you are not going up too much anyway secondly your direct managers power is pervasive and democracy is nonexistent of course the org is flat and on top of your manager there is roger president who is kind and approachable by the way what this means is that managers have no chance to move up in the company because they cant replace roger when you get no chance to go up in a company what would you do you think about next opportunity and you dont think about taking a longterm view in managing and helping your reports some manager chose to use everything they could to get things for themselves in preparation for a future job jump and some times this is at the expense of what could help researchers when your manager takes a very shortterm view to maximize his gain thats bad news for you what makes it worse is your manager decides everything literally everything from what you should work on on a weekly basis what intern you may get in the summer if you get one whats your performance review and bonus and who you should put on your paper of course manager gets to be on almost every paper regardless of how little he does for that paper this kind of massive power on a manager can easily produce dictators in the meetings generally people are obedient towards the manager rather than actively voicing their opinions its sad now lets come to compensation japanese companies generally dont believe in giving out equity stocks to employees its a fact that in the bay area you cant live on wages alone houses can easily go 1x million if you want to be in a reasonable area with good elementary schools and close to where you work this is a very realistic problem if you want to have a life here dont forget that you will not get what you are offered its taxed much higher than when you were at school so you will get about close to half of that amount think about how long you will be able to get your down payment for a house and pay back the debt compare that with upstart american companies its very easy to find such information from friends or online realistically think about your livelihood and think if its going to be worthwhile to make half of what you could make for a few papers that you may or may not get to publish some people chose to join this place to get a green card because nec applies for it for you right after you start this is totally unnecessary with your papers and phd degree you will get an eb1 green card almost anywhere you go in a few months the cost totally outweigh the gain and finally you want to be working in a place that you are proud of consider if this is going to be that place if you are the kind of people who want to get a wow when you tell people where you work youll be disappointed if you join this place

Thoughtworks,4,2024-01-12,was amazing but kinda lost its way,digital marketing specialist,former employee more than 5 years,Bengaluru,incredible work culture and fantastic colleagues create an unparalleled experience the level of trust extended to employees is unprecedented distinguishing this as a truly employeecentric organization the global marketing team consistently treated you with utmost respect and valued your contributions highly abundant learning opportunities abound and the companys commitment to worklife balance enhances the overall quality of life,for a company that prided itself on inclusion i felt like an outsider not in terms of race or sexual orientation and all those things but working in operations and especially marketing you are treated like a secondgrade citizen by the ps folks inside the marketing cocoon you notice nothing but once you step out of it the problems become more apparent lately with the rapid expansion following the public listing and the consequent layoffs the company seems to have lost its way a bunch of mediocre hires especially at slightly senior levels is making the company lose its familylike feel finally the career opportunities for internal growth seem to go only to those in global north

Red Hat,1,2023-12-14,red hat has been bluewashed,anonymous employee,former employee,,smart people wonderful colleagues,the company has gone downhill since the ibm acquisition specifically after the original executive team left red hat is now just a business unit theyre not even pretending to hold rht apart as a separate company anymore the only goal is to generate as much profit for ibm as possible all of the thought and industry leadership that red hat provided for the open source community is gone red hat is a dying culture its sad to watch
Red Hat,2,2023-05-18,goodbye open culture,people team,current employee more than 5 years,,the red hat that once was before current leadership was in place was full of opportunity and growth open was real,the current leadership in place at red hat is out to change the place altogether take the recent layoffs as an example the people team did their layoffs in a 4 minute call the people team the team that is supposed to care about how this place is run how people are treated they showed their true colors they eliminated roles and it wasnt performance based but then its uncovered that they just moved the remaining people into those roles to put a bandaid on the gaps is that how it works seems a littlesuspicious and it cannot go without being addressed that the current leader of the people team is essentially hiring all of her friends from cisco shes been at red hat 2 years and slowly chipping away at this great company conforming to other companies cultures and ways of doing business and erasing how red hat has operated for so many years dont get me wrong change is necessary and how a company grows but at what point do we question the leadership for devastating change

Red Hat,4,2023-06-13,great colleagues good work mixed vision,developer advocate,current employee,,most reviews mention the same pros but i guess ill repeat them the wlb and work culture is pretty great you get to work with interesting technology and many great people honestly the pay and benefits are pretty good rsu allocation could be higher given the wlb its not bad in my opinion its just not as high as some peers people putting in the extra effort generally get more rsus to my knowledge and do get raises,some teams and people complain of poor compensation lack of raises and rsus lots of people at red hat were able to coast and got stuck in old ways there was a huge bias towards enterprise java and onpremise until recently sure its a large part of the market and core business but it left red hat looking like old hat theres a lot of process at times all big companies probably get this way but its frustrating when simple or important tasks can take weeks to finish leadership has felt directionless for a while though they are improving recent layoffs were handled poorly some high value peopleinitiatives were mistakenly affected and morale took a hit

Red Hat,3,2023-09-18,mileage will vary but beware,product sales specialist,former employee more than 3 years,,,this is a sale oriented review so it likely isnt relevant to other areas i personally would not recommend working at red hat the culture has severely degraded and while openshift and ansible are very good solutions they do not justify the premium ibm is driving from red hat in order to recoup their $34b investment red hat is on a negative trajectory and although ibm is buying time to turn it around its not a pleasant place to be right now otes have become largely unobtainable except for the very few top accounts everyone else is looking at a multiyear cadence of hitting less than 50 of quota with some only achieving single digits for a 5050 plan that just isnt acceptable and nearly everyone ive talked to is actively looking for a new gig management is in selfpreservation mode distancing themselves as much as they can from the underperforming regionsaccounts this means a pip culture has started and those with the short straw are being left with no real alternative than to leaveregardless of their overall abilities be aware that the comp plan is rumored to be changing significantly in 2024 and no one seems very clear as to how it will impact sales people ask some good questions if you are interviewing i also have found that red hat on my resume is to not a positive attribute the red hat reputation as a legacy brand along with the ibm association isnt very interesting to most hiring managersat least not in sales

Red Hat,2,2023-03-28,ibm finally taking over,sales area manager,current employee more than 10 years,"Raleigh, NC",there isnt really anyone out there doing what red hat does so if youre technical and get in to the technology or enjoy helping customers advance their missions with best of bread technology red hat is solid,going on two years of quotas that arent based on reality you cant take an account that took 5 years to build and double it in 1 year as an example this year because quotas are so high there arent sales funnels to support it so new oversight policies are in place that look to be only there to permit terminations without question back office processes are so broken some people have had paychecks not issued and it takes weeks to get benefits questions answered or issues resolved its really sad to see how far red hat has fallen
Red Hat,4,2023-08-15,your team matters,senior communications strategist,former employee more than 10 years,"Raleigh, NC",theres some great teams with amazing culture and support benefits are overall solid lots of internal pride and motivation to do the right thing,evolving to become more like ibm its parent company the recent layoffs a first are evidence of that plus the quote from the ceo on how layoffs are healthy in an interview there will be a lot more change and a lot more restructuring whole programs are being sliced

Red Hat,5,2023-04-04,great open source company to work for,software engineering associate manager,current employee,,emphasis on employee welfare great forward strategic thinking from the upper management open and inclusive environment strong customer support experience emphasis so at least our customers really like us and dont just use our software because they dont have any other choice,we dont have any sort of vendor lock in so every day we are fighting to stay on top theres no break from the pressure worklife balance can suffer as a result red hat has always attracted people with a philosophical axe to grind in favor of open source software and have relied on that to allow them to hire top talent at a lower pay rate than they otherwise might have to pay since the people that come here want to be here in order to further grind that open source axe

Zendesk,2,2023-05-01,company slowly being dismantled for scrap,manager,former employee,,my first few years at zendesk were very lucrative as the company was lean and capable of innovating,in the last few years the board let the ceo bounce from failed mission to failed mission the board went right along with these polarizing collections of buzzwords that ultimately cost us everything this culminated in a battle to sell the company that was heavily politicized internally ultimately he declined a fair offer our shares lost half their value in a few months that left us with a fire sale offer from bloodless private equity stakeholders we were lucky to get half the peak value of our remaining shares the first and continuing order of business has been to reduce the payrolls this started with layoffs in november 2022 like a few hundred others this was my last day the weekend before they leaked the plans with an early filing in accordance with the warn act presumably this was an effort to demoralize more into quitting hundreds of longtime employees in good standing were fired in order to signal to pe that were a real superserious company now obviously this wasnt enough and remaining management is being coached to reduce the payrolls in mediumtohigh cost of living areas

Zendesk,2,2023-01-10,a mess,sales representative,former employee less than 1 year,,there are some genuinely decent and talent people amidst the sea of the passive aggressive and passthebuck sorts,so very many deals over 1k are considered strategic on an enterprise team the company uses a competitor crm internally as their own offering isnt competitive management reaching out for long conversations and requests to do work on days off its a bureaucratic nightmare to get anything done the pricing model is ridiculous and unsustainable even the ceo skipped town while there are decent people here far too many people speak out of both sides of their mouth and that includes senior leadership the gotomarket strategy hasnt evolved to meet where the market is today alot of inflated egos alot of highly anxious fearbased behaviors too much insincere passiveaggressive and sometimes just aggressive behaviors claims to be diverse and welcoming but also lost a class action suit due to unfair treatment of protected classes every company has problem areas where they could do better but zendesk stacks alot of issues with very positives to offset the nonsense
Zendesk,1,2023-06-04,the ceo wrote to those who were laid off saying how great the future is for zendesk,senior manager,former employee,,many smart talented colleagues you do feel connected to your global peers the pay and benefits seemed fair,leadership is tone deaf in the layoff notification to those affected the ceo wrote how great the future is for zendesk absolutely zero transparency since the new leadership team took over in 2022 they will overwork you to the bone again and again managers tell you to set boundaries but then do not lead by example because they are scared of their own managers and leadership also it did not seem like an equitable place for women at least in my department

Zendesk,2,2023-06-06,treasure turned to trash,account executive,current employee,,flexible work environment 100 remote for those 50+ miles away from any office location they leave you alone if you perform well pto for sales is 21 days + you get 11 or 12 paid holidays product has great brand recognition,sold to private equity firms in november 2022 and theyve turned what was once a treasure of a company into trash and a stress pit they sneakily cut gtms commission structures so you have to hit around 150 of your quota or more on average to hit ote they bamboozled everyone into thinking the new commission structure was going to make them more money but if you read the actual icp its the complete opposite sales leadership didnt even understand the new icp and how it affected them even until it was brought to their attention by concerned aes nothings changed though but supposedly now that leadership knows theyre affected by it too theyre pushing for change tbd but not hopeful the culture is going way downhill it used to be amazing but now everyone is extremely stressed all the time and overworked theres no worklife balance anymore the pe firm have also made what was promised last year from the old ownership to be a 100 flexible wfh if you want environment to forcing anyone who lives within a 50 mile radius of an office to go back to the office at least twice a week 50 miles is a lot and to be forced to do so after years of wfh and being able to enjoy life more is horrible in my mind its easy for executive leadership to force return to offices when they have the money to pay for their childcare what about the people who cant im glad i live far more than 50 miles way from an office because everyone i know who has been forced back at zendesk is not happy about it office work isnt the way for millennials and gen z and wasting life commuting and having your mental health affected being forced to go back to a physical office isnt the new way of life anymore all departments are so disconnected from one another and the processes they have in place conflict with another departments so theres no true real process its extremely cumbersome and has only gotten worse with the new pe firm takeover unvested rsus were cut by 50+ for pay out with the new ownership came in went from 30k to just 12k the pe firm took away a crucial benefit for employees when they took over recharge fridays where we got half days every friday now its one friday per quarter pe firm took away personal development funds as well i know there are other cons i just cant think of right now

Deliveroo,2,2024-02-07,do not recommend,sr manager,current employee more than 1 year,"London, England",great people almost everyone is very friendly and kind very diverse and international teams some job flexibility ive seen people move internally every 12 years to very different roles but now its much harder with new processes,benefits have decreased over the past 2 years no more equity for middle managers and junior level employees l6 and below 2 redundancies over the past couple of years one in 2020 and another in 2023 high expectations and workloads with low salaries over the past year workloads have increased due to people leaving combined with redundancies but roles are rarely backfilled that workload is shifted to existing employees now roles and responsibilities of every level have increased while salary bands have decreased very few promotions this year and salary increases are very minimal and not worth the increased expectations high turnover i think average turnover is around 1 year return to office 3 days a week mandatory too much change every few months there is an org change so its difficult to understand long term direction and growth of the company lack of empathy from leadership the expectation is you work hard even if redundancies have happened salary increases are minimal and morale is low
Deliveroo,2,2024-02-10,slow hierarchical and lack of innovation,product manager,current employee more than 3 years,"London, England",pay is decent not at the same levels of meta but definitely above market average pm 6080k senior pm 80100k staff pm 100125k group pm 125 150k high quality engineers in particular in the india office,where do we start lack of diversity in management leadership mainly comes from consultancy backgrounds death by documents very heavy on prds tdds and in general 2pagers because of the focus on documentation the company is incredibly slow the company has no culture or whatsoever high attrition complete lack of product innovation no sense of strategic direction company is outperformed by uber eats and just eat in every aspect
Deliveroo,2,2024-02-07,leadership is making terrible short term decisions,staff product designer,current employee more than 3 years,"London, England",working with great people on a really interesting area of tech i enjoy it loads,after their second round of standard tech redundancies they ended up having to rehire plenty people anyway ever since the pace of development has slowed to a snails pace innovation is stifled and deliveroo will end up falling behind now they are refusing to give promotions to the majority of people in the latest performance review likely hoping people will quit so they wont have to pay redundancies all that is going to happen is we will loose the best people and they will end up having to spend more money hiring and training new people to take their place all a waste in the name of saving money add to this the decision to return to the office 3 days a week while not returning any of the pre covid office benefits like snacks or free lunches it seems like the employees are undervalued
Deliveroo,2,2024-02-01,going steadily downhill,data scientist,current employee more than 3 years,,not much micromanaging variety of work good culture among colleagues,lack of job security every few months the company implements some new policy to worsen working conditions eg no longer awarding stock options to any but the most senior staff forcing people back into the office redundancies implementing new metrics for tracking productivity the company does not consider employee feedback when making decisions staffing crises caused by the company trying to outsource new hiring overseas meaning that when people leave they are very slow to be replaced

Deliveroo,1,2024-01-19,dont do it,lawyer,former employee more than 1 year,,i unfortunately dont have any pros would not recommend at all,legal team is not a great place to work at deliveroo work life balance does not exist management think one free evening is sufficient the teams work in silos and there is a blame culture blame is aimed at everyone except where it should sit which is with the leadership team leadership is dreadful petty and separates the team into likes or not treating people accordingly atmosphere and morale is poor and work is not great determined by mbas other parts of the business who dont know what they are doing turnover is extremely high caused by terrible management who are even worse at management than they are at the law

ServiceNow,5,2023-12-21,best culture and best tech in the business,customer success manager,current employee less than 1 year,,there is a genuine commitment and distinctive vibe when it comes to values inclusion and belonging exceeds the positive values that is communicated its no surprise servicenow is highlighted for so many workforce categories but the one that energizes me most is americas greatest workplaces for diversity the company is a global tech hub all teams across departments are diverse and assembled with talented folks our success can be attributed to our high influential ceo and the strategic decision making of the leadership team from the p4 to your direct manager and peer teammates are top caliber individuals in the technology industry goals and expectations are personalized so that you are evolving professionally servicenow celebrates your achievements and is a steadfast champion the office spaces perks and employee benefits are super nice flexible work arrangements and familyoriented programs so that you are able to do your best work and live well a good mix of company events and social activities across the company professional development opportunities are endless at servicenow the platform stays fresh and ahead of market trends with regular enhancements customers have a range of selections to maximize the value of the technology robust security measures to protect customer data and build trust first movers in multiple verticals ive worked in the big five tech and i am blown away at how much new innovation is live in the current release and road mapped for future releases servicenow is the largest rocket ship i have ever been on,i wish i joined servicenow sooner because this has been my best tech experience in over 10 years
ServiceNow,3,2024-02-13,great presentation with underlying problems,manager,current employee more than 3 years,"Vienna, VA",servicenow talks a big game and in many ways follows through the csuite is largely competent and their performance has consistently led to the stock price increasing broadly the company culture is supportive and talks a big game when it comes to dei broadly the company lives up to its stated goals but experiences vary depending on the team the company is a rocket ship and the momentum is palpable,your experience at servicenow will depend on the team that you are on managers run their teams as their own personal fiefdoms and experiences can vary some managers are not qualified for their jobs the companys public sector strategy is not good recent hiring decisions have made it clear the company prioritizes short term gain over long term sustainability this will likely negatively affect servicenow in the long run
ServiceNow,2,2023-12-06,great people terrible processes,senior manager,current employee more than 1 year,"Santa Clara, CA",overwhelmingly the greatest people you will ever work with smart hard working and kind to each other whatever experience you want to grow professionally you will find it here ceo bill mcdermott is inspiring everytime he talks he is a true visionary and the company is fortunate to have him,most processes ironically are still very manual as the company grows and changes the tools and technology arent updated leaving teams with unmanageable amounts of manual work this is raised as biggest issue every year in employee feedback surveys but nothing ever improves just more manual work to compensate for bad tools and processes lots of pressure from leaders to deliver results but no direction or support to improve they promise it then back out when its time to deliver on their promises yet they still expect perfect execution from their teams most teams are completely burned out unrealistic expectations and demands without support no time to do anything but work no time for learning career development or even vacation time off = work builds up so you either work while on vacation and or work even more hours when youre back just to get caught up
ServiceNow,2,2024-01-31,mixed experiences in my first month at servicenow france,regional partnership manager,current employee,,competitive salaries the compensation at servicenow is commendable and aligns well with industry standards product awesome platform,cultural disconnect the work culture in the french office seems misaligned with the global ethos of servicenow this has been a significant concern during my initial days here onboarding challenges my onboarding experience was marred by delays and a lack of support the delayed delivery of my laptop significantly hampered my ability to start effectively and the response from my manager added to the stress rather than alleviating it age dynamics the average age at the office appears to skew over 50 creating an implicit bias towards younger employees like myself this age dynamic seems to affect perceived credibility and acceptance within the team worklife balance theres an unspoken expectation to work long hours which is not necessarily linked to productivity or efficiency this oldschool mentality clashes with the innovative image projected by servicenow externally limited diversity in recruitment the hiring pattern predominantly favors candidates from specific former employers xoracle xsalesforce xmicrosoft which leads to a lack of diverse perspectives in the workplace
ServiceNow,5,2024-01-30,great first year excited for the future,renewal account manager,current employee less than 1 year,Amsterdam,it has been a great experience working at servicenow from the hiring process to onboarding ramping up with fellow new hires as well as getting the trust and support from my teammates has been nothing short of fantastic when joining coming from a small software company that ive been a part of for nearly 13 years i did wonder if i was going to be one of many and would get lost in such a large organization servicenow has proven to me over the past year that this fear could not be further from the truth i feel welcomed and really experienced that i directly contribute to how well servicenow is doing together with my direct team and everyone,as servicenow has been growing so incredibly fast there are some systems processes that are only now catching up to where they need to be servicenow has been transparent with me what these challenges were and they have been open to critical feedback all with the intention of becoming better
ServiceNow,5,2024-02-02,best company i worked for,customer success manager,current employee more than 1 year,"Dublin, Dublin",great perks you will be working with very smart people and learning a lot the product is amazing the culture in the company as well no micro management and very free to get the job done as you want to do it i love it,there is a lot happening so you have to be ready to adapt to change and also to deal with ambiguity sometimes roles are not so clear and can be understood differently by different people
ServiceNow,5,2024-02-06,on a rocketship and feeling confident in this company,anonymous employee,current employee less than 1 year,,fast growing company that is paying off to its employees stock is doing extremely well benefits and pay are good i feel well compensated for a nontechnical role they keep culture at the center but i would encourage leadership to make sure not to lose sight of it as we continue to climb up,a lot of growing pains because we are scaling so quickly as a company lots of operational rigor that is needed but everybody is moving too fast that the systems and processes that need to be in place arent being placed fast enough
ServiceNow,3,2024-02-02,some growing up to do,sales,former employee more than 1 year,"Atlanta, GA",the companys stock is doing well so get rsus pays on the upper end of market insurance was average products seem good perhaps a bit pricey not overly high pressure which ends up being a con if youre looking for commissions,its a productdriven company with no real sales discipline to speak of they havent figured out accountbased selling differing to reactionary transactions driven by the customer ignoring a prescriptive vision and roadmap for the account that worked at the outset but will limit growth to the next level if they want to get dollars outside of it

Citrix,4,2023-07-09,not as bad as it was,support and services,current employee more than 10 years,,ive been at citrix now for a long time and im one of the more tenured individuals still at the company ive been in multiple positions and can speak to how the teams are being managed this entire review will be broken down with before acqusition and after acquisition since a lot of the other reviews keep mentioning how things were while wearing rose tinted glasses before acqusition pros no longer valid ================================ more team outtings more team dinners better team building activities culture was better for smaller teams and harder to improve for larger teams due to budgetary concerns sales cycle was fine at first became very convoluted towards the end publicly traded so we had the ability to do a stock purchase plan 12 workfromhome days for certain orgs or full remote for other orgs great new hire experience until we were fully remote during covid new hires failed often when full remote due to the lacking training infrastructure for this model more laidback environment but came at a cost of nothing really getting done towards the end after acquisition pros ================== were now fully in office also has some cons in of itself making the new hire experience significantly better and reduced the time to train from fully remote 1216 months to 612 months due to real time collaboration getting headcount that we desperately needed in many orgs see cons good restructure that makes sense on paper reduced linear reporting no longer have sr managers reporting to sr managers reporting to sr managers now its more linear and easy to follow payscale increases to be at or above industry standard significantly reducing churn comparatively promotion opportunities more easily accessible complete redesign of our internal standard operating procedures making things make sense again company hands out private equity shares to those who contribute to getting things back on track when you need to work from home you can there is a system in place that allows you to work from home with your direct managers approval unlimited pto if given 2 weeks in advance sick days are still metered but pto for trips and such are not still has great insurance and benefits as we did prior to the acqusition though i do miss the epo plan which was removed,most of the information needing to read will be in this section having read through almost all of the reviews since the acqusition many of these reviewers tend to look at the past with rose tinted glasses im sure the experience between these individuals is drastically different than my own or even each other but its important to remember that our stock price didnt fall to $90share because of what our new leadership did the old leadership did a number on the citrix organization that will take years to recover from and the anger rightly deserves to rest with them not to say the new leadership is absolved from bad policy but a majority of these policies are being created to fix what the former leadership did incorrectly cons prior to acquisition prior to and up to henshall and his subordinates ========================================================== after mark templeton leadership cared more about the shareholders than you and it was obvious this got worse year over year teams were completely gutted or skeleton crewed to make the numbers look better hiring cycles were a disaster youd be given 30 days to fill xnumber of reqs which included the time of advertising interviewing making a decision etc this forced teams to hire the good enough instead of the right talent if you couldnt make a decision by your 30th day then the req was frozen pulled and who knows when itd be released again this caused us to not be able to staff people who left let alone get the right headcount for the staff we needed poor business decisions resulting in a very bipolar stock price ie temporary licenses during covid were an outright failure poor purchases that left us hundreds of millions of dollars in debt for an item that didnt improve our portfolio or werent used at all hyper investments into poor performing products that only proved the sunk cost fallacy instead of investing where most of the money originated from high turnover of ceos and csuite employees high turnover in support sales consulting technical account managers inability to retain top talent due to being underpaid by industry standard extremely prevalent yes man culture once you get to director or above not in all cases but many cons new leadership under tom krause ================================ mandatory rto those of us who did perform 100150 when remote were gaslit in the first gem and made to believe that we were underperforming as a whole those of us who realized the benefits of working fully remote less cost commuting more time with family a way better worklife balance are now all gone however the statstics that you can pull yourself using our own internal crm system can prove that this was a minority of people many individuals were performing suboptimally or barely hitting their kpis they were unresponsive and some were blatantly caught working two jobs at the same time during the same hours not moonlighting this is firsthand experience not me parrotting what someone else has said engineering teams being treated as support makes it very hard to retain new talent in the engineering spaces they got hired to code but are being used for support purposes sales have changed to prioritize the largest and abovetheline customers training content is also subpar for what we need fatigued workforce remnant from the old workforce but makes people fatigued when the new processes from the new leadership come down the pipe new system software being used instead of the legacy software outlook replaced with gmail teams replaced with zoom these are cost saving endeavors to avoid further layoffs but these softwares are not enterprise ready and it makes your day to day harder to manage and organize gmail is absolutely the worst offender of this due to how difficult it is to produce filters that make much sense

Tripadvisor,1,2024-01-10,a regrettable experience at tripadvisor,sales,former employee more than 1 year,,lifestyle benefit is a nice perk as well as the company shut down week between christmas and new years,i joined tripadvisor with high hopes and enthusiasm believing it would be a stepping stone for my career growth however my time at the company turned out to be the biggest regret of my professional life the companys primary focus appears to be solely on revenue with little regard for the wellbeing of its employees or the satisfaction of its customers the lack of value placed on both internal and external stakeholders is evident in every aspect of the organization one of the most glaring issues is the disorganized structure of the company the communication and updates are shockingly poor leaving employees in the dark about crucial information teams seem to lack passion for the business resulting in a noticeable lack of desire to excel in their daily tasks the leadership team unfortunately is both inexperienced and unorganized their approach is not only tonedeaf but also sloppy leaving employees feeling unsupported and undervalued a striking example of this is the insistence on fulltime office attendance while leaders enjoy vacations in exotic locations such as the bahamas joining meetings remotely this stark contrast in expectations and actions highlights the lack of empathy and understanding within the leadership team communication breakdowns are rampant with emails frequently ignored and political games playing a significant role in daytoday operations this creates an unhealthy work environment contributing to the overall dissatisfaction among employees the benefits package provided by tripadvisor is severely lacking causing numerous headaches and troubleshooting efforts there is a palpable lack of trust in how commissions are calculated and paid out further eroding confidence in the companys transparency and fairness in addition their were hidden cliffs with in 401k and rsu options the limited support given to teams and customers alike underscores the companys lack of commitment to their wellbeing in conclusion my experience at tripadvisor has been nothing short of disappointing this move which i had initially looked forward to the most in my career turned out to be a profound letdown i strongly caution anyone considering employment with or engaging in business with tripadvisor to think twice the companys prioritization of revenue over its people and customers combined with its organizational and leadership issues make it an undesirable place to work or collaborate with
Tripadvisor,5,2024-01-03,culture wonderful at tripadvisor,executive assistant,current employee more than 5 years,"Newton, MA",hard working fun and kind colleagues incredible free lunch every day job security and opportunities to grow your career,some of my friends left the company because they werent given raises they felt they deserved
Tripadvisor,4,2023-09-18,good company overall,senior product designer,former employee more than 1 year,"San Antonio, TX",i really enjoyed the benefits compensation was respectable and the people on my team were wonderful some of the best ive had the privilege of working alongside in my corporate career,sometimes it felt as though leadership lacked vision not necessarily the company leadership but the area that i worked in and the appropriate appetite for risk to enable a culture of innovation there seemed to be a misalignment in priorities between focus areas and leadership often causing for excessive pivoting or work once deemed critical to be shelved once they tighten up the vision and take an unwavering approach to product development the sky is the limit

Meltwater,1,2022-06-23,stay away,sales consultant,former employee more than 1 year,"Atlanta, GA",the only pro about this place is that it opens the door to real software jobs,zero work life balance subpar pay unreachable quotas 70 hour work weeks poor leadership at every level very poor leadership at the top i was told that i had to earn my personal life consistently worked until 8 pm at night had to take off for a doctors appointment and was given hell for it by director i was lied to before accepting an offer about the work from home and work life balance management will find any and every reason to make you come into the office for unrealistic hours if you are not 15 hours early youre late and if you dont stay till 7 pm or later you get in trouble for leaving early additionally i was also forced to lie to future applicants that were considering accepting an offer by the company in fear of retribution for being honest about the toxic work environment during my time with meltwater there were 2 lawsuits settled for workplace mistreatment it would be my guess that there are many more to come all of this would be tolerable if the pay was good however as a sales consultant you can only expect to make about 60k

Gemalto,2,2017-05-24,struggling to adapt,marketing,current employee more than 3 years,"Baltimore, MD",worklife balance is good work from home flexibility promotion from within this is a doublesided sword as they pay internal promotions less than they would external hires relocation flexibility,lack of organization slow to adapt different departments get to play by different rules lots of bureaucratic red tape and policies that hinder efficiency prefer to work a lot of departments on skeleton crews which create frustrations and inefficiency but keep overhead costs lower annual raises are low 401k match was lessened health insurance went up in price and quality went down still trying to find financial traction due to lower revenue from saturated chip market employee grievances are heard but never addressed low morale for a lot of teams

Gemalto,1,2017-04-08,political company and questionable leadership,marketing director,former employee more than 8 years,"Belcamp, MD",i did work with a few smart collaborative and happy people unfortunately not many this company promotes the opportunity to transfer across functions and will relocate you around the world if you choose but this company does little to train or advance people who do not want either of those opportunities i learned a lot in my role earlier with a company that gemalto acquired that allowed me to thankfully leave here and find a better company to work for,the political environment at this company is causing low morale stressed out employees and high turnover executives make decisions based on political motives and not company efficiency causing unnecessary power struggles between teams many people work in silos lower than industry average salaries and for some leaders ethics and professionalism are nonexistent

Gemalto,2,2018-02-13,awful management and understaffed,anonymous employee,former employee more than 3 years,,gemalto has quite many great employees that work tirelessly to yield great results with the little that they have they put in long hours attend early morning pointless meetings and work late in to the night until we get more people management doesnt often recognize the efforts of those that are not in the upper echelon but you will find peers that will look out for your wellbeing this is actually the strongest point of this company the employees really band together and try to make the best with what they have you will make friends easily and look forward to seeing them each day if you have a fondness for travel or working with people from all over the world you will feel just at home in gemalto you will likely need to coordinate with multiple international teams and have meetings with your manager who will be located in france if you are lucky or are in a more sales role you will get to enjoy more international travel since gemalto doesnt compete very well in the usa market internal recruitment is pretty good you can jump up diagonally or horizontally quite easily this is great for gaining experience in a field that you thought would have been locked away professionally behind several years of experience in a different company health care and dental are really good wish i had given birth or broken a bone while i was on their plan,the upper most management and hr are not dependable or trustable great hr people will eventually leave the company leaving behind a slew of yesmen you will have some one promoted over you quite quickly because they are friends with the right person the company wasnt like this long ago but thats the turn that it took in late 2016 going in to 2017 you will find some good managers on the low levels but it is rare what you will encounter is a management culture that is much more focused on their personal gain than your place in the company you will find managers that block your opportunities to move around to other teams or are unwilling to give you the raise that you deserve it is unfortunate that this company refuses to try and retain their talent you will never get enough people on your team since this company keeps losing good talent you will always be doing the job of 2 employees or more even when they hire more talent it is only a matter of time till your next team member leaves most people are underpaid

Gemalto,3,2015-06-16,gemalto is a really great company with great products,anonymous employee,current employee more than 10 years,"Austin, TX",this is a good company with great cutting edge products i really like being a part of it i enjoy going to work every day and like everyone in the office there are a lot of very nice people working here the flexibility is great if i have an errand to run i can leave the office if work permits and go do it no problem 401k matching and sometimes stock purchase benefits are available,if you speak french you have it made at gemalto if you are american you will be lucky if you ever get in management there are a few vp level american managers at our office most are french however they are men if you are a lady your chances of getting into management are in the miracle category along these lines at gemalto you are probably working for a french person many times this person is actually in france this is problematic because your french manager will provide resources and time to the people he sees in front of him in france you are in the us so you will often draw the short straw objectives are written in broken english so may be difficult to understand phone calls and emails from your manager may be equally as cryptic it is very difficult to get a raise at gemalto definitely negotiate what you want at the get go there will be low and few increases after you join hard work is not rewarded you are always told that you were expected to do the things you do even if you work insanely hard on things that are not in your objectives this goes back to above low raises perhaps they dont want to give you credit for your work or else they may have to give you a raise if you need a pat on the back for your good work this is not the place for you you will probably only get feedback if there is an issue that needs modification it is hit and miss as far as management goes you could be lucky and get a good manager but most of the managers are promoted for being great developers and are not the best managers there is a lot of politics going on it is not conducive to good teamwork it is kind of an every man for himself type atmosphere your managers top priority is looking good if you are one of those people who likes to come to the office and work and go home get ready to learn about politics
Gemalto,2,2015-11-01,career stagnation,personalization engineersoftware developer,current employee more than 8 years,"Montgomeryville, PA",good pay and benefits fairly flexible schedule,micromanaging boxing you are put in a box in the sense that you are expected to work on the same domain for years on end unwillingness to allow development teams to have ownership of their product domain thus leading to employees feeling disempowered demotivated lacking passion for their work and rampant justified cynicism towards management initiatives this is a 9to5 environment where nobody really cares much about what they do they just do it because it pays the bills zero innovation unless you work at the gemenos france office because every new idea must be vetted by corporate managers and when good ideas are presented they are often taken and repackaged by corporate rd leaving engineers at satellite offices with no recognition extremely difficult to move within the company if youre not a yes man who never questions the status quo very high employee turnaround due to the reasons above and intense internal politics and bureaucracy you may thrive in this environment if you are a social butterfly whos good at navigating the bureaucracy and play your cards right but then youre probably not a great engineer and the problem is that the top is full of the aggressive corporate ladder climbers who got there by stepping on their peers and those people will be your managers expect unreasonable deadlines nonsensical requirements superfluous projects designed to pad some project managers resume time consuming tracking of developer time down to the hour yes even fulltime salaried software engineers must produce detailed reports of how they spent their time among other nonsense being a french company everything of french origin gets precedence french nationals enjoy very generous expatriate contracts to work overseas a disproportionate amount of internal thirdparty software solutions are of french origin despite the fact that they are often considerable inferior and more expensive than leading providers one last thing that really bother me is the extensive use of open source software internally without any kind of contribution back to the floss community when gemalto cant find a french company to provide some service they will grab an open source solution customize it and deploy it internally worldwide all while not allowing employees to make any contributions to those projects as a matter of company policy some exceptions exist mostly employees who have developed solutions in their own personal time
Gemalto,2,2015-11-30,job growth but at a high cost,anonymous employee,current employee,"Belcamp, MD",if you want to do different things in your career gemalto encourages you to take different positions and will pay for you to move within country or internationally quite often this means taking positions in areas where you have no background or expertise for instance they are quite happy to move someone from a vp of operations to a vp of marketing they also strongly encourage internal transfer and promotion which means theres a real career ladder at gemalto excellent benefits including generous pto decent health care plans and exceptional life insurance,gemalto spends less than half the industry average on marketing making it challenging to get in front of customers leadership is focused exclusively on how profitable the company is from year to year rather than competitiveness or leadership over the long term gemalto does not allow you to be rehired if you leave you are gone permanently even if you are a better and cheaper options than other candidates its difficult to get rid of underperforming employees even if they do damage to the business gemalto does not pay for any training or education outside of their own programs gemalto caps their maximum pay at the 50th percentile for the region making hiring qualified outside people very difficult and results in pretty poor compensation internally there is a lot of blame and fingerpointing when something doesnt work well with a few notable exceptions there is very little accountability

Xilinx,4,2016-03-23,heavily depends on the team,anonymous employee,current employee,,im fortunate enough to work in a great team with a few very brilliant people one of them happens to be my manager the second level manager is also very good at what they do the work is interesting sure it is interleaved with some mundane stuff but theres great flexibility in how much you choose to do and you pretty much have a say in what you work on and what you want to learn the roadmap looks good and outlook looks positive weve been continuously ahead in the industry for the past few years and looks like momentum will continue there are some really great folks working here with whom ive become very good friends easy culture full of exciting fun people of all age cant beat the location half the folks i know work here for that reason,promotion is slow and bureaucratic even if you are performing higher than you should and are nominated for promotion red tape usually stops your promotion or give a 12 review cycle latency higher level management sr vp and above seems disconnected from lower level workers and are looking out for their own interest not enough company wide events and when they do happen seem cheap and badly put together there are some seriously underwhelming people working here on all teams whom i have no idea how they got hired in the first place if you happen to get on a team with more of those or have to work with a team like that then prepare for frustration they should really screen the candidates better the distribution of skillstalent is crazy

Xilinx,3,2014-01-30,in the business of helping other companies innovate but internal processes are old inefficient and expensive,anonymous employee,current employee more than 8 years,"Longmont, CO",great pay ability to work from home somewhat flexible work hours espp 401k matching and health benefits are all great,decisions are made in my department by senior managers who dont understand the customers needs internal processes are slow inefficient and error prone and therefore expensive things that can and should be automated are being done manually requiring much more work than necessary they wont replace people in my department when they leave so we are now doing 2x the work with 12 the number of people although the schedule is flexible i often have to be available for meetings early in the morning or late at night because the development team is in india and china layoffs are frequent and with no communication its frustrating to be working on a project with someone have them not show up to a meeting only to find out that they have been laid off this has happened more than once the performance review process is a joke self assessments have no bearing on grade and bonusesraises are not given fairly profit sharing used to include everyone in the company but now only goes to some employees based on review grade work + work + work + work = burnout
Xilinx,1,2009-04-27,the greed and averous of the executive management is disgusting,senior staff engineer,current employee,"Longmont, CO",xilinx still has many exceptionally talented people working here for now the work ethic and integrity of most individual contributors is exceptional despite the ridiculous burden of work placed upon them due to layoffs,the apparent greed and averous of the executive management is disgusting they have shown monumental short sightedness in most of their recent business decisions they have been completely reactionary to the competition and have been outmaneuvered at every point since taking over in 08 xilinx presently has over 30 vps or higher and more than 180 directors or higher showing that the ratio of senior management to individual contributors is skewed to a nonsensical extreme xilinx is acting like a start up in askingpushing employees to put in very long hours to make up for the reduction in staff after two sizable layoffs this might be reasonable if employees believed management had some intelligent plan for the future but no such plan has been communicated there is little prospect of reward for the extra effort being demanded when the economy improves i predict a mass exodus from xilinx us and europe this is probably what moshe is wanting so he can move more jobs to india and singapore
Xilinx,2,2009-07-11,oh how the mighty have fallen,engineer,current employee,"San Jose, CA",1 even though xilinx has successfully improved its stock price haha by letting go many of the longerterm employees whether they were excellent employees or not and in important roles or not there are still many great people who work here sharp engineers helpful peers a willingness to see the companys products succeed in spite of the incompetent senior management and critically bad morale 2 unless youre part of the executive staff youre not actually forced to listen to moshe speak in person he seems to prefer to hide from the common folk,with maybe one or two exceptions the new senior management team are scarybad with the scariest and baddest at the top its truly amazing how some people get the jobs that they do compassion morale open communication and anything resembling the previous corporate values have flown out the door and the bottom line is now absolute king which may not even sound that bad to some people but the problem is these clowns are demonstrating they have absolutely no clue how to get there somehow slashing longtime employees and throwing away everything that existed before they got here isnt working huh go figure maybe the stock will finally go up after theyve outsourced all of the jobs except for their own to india and singapore im guessing thats their next move
Xilinx,2,2009-08-01,just another company,anonymous employee,current employee,,strong technology and market leadership pockets of excellent chip design engineers who understand fpga technology and how to tie everything together to make a functional product a lot of very hard working individuals who will work 247 to tape out a chip,new management team is technically strong but all come from a asic background and dont seem to understand or care to learn about the custom design nature of an fpga however under the previous management team continuous improvement was not something encouraged unless one of a few select individuals wanted it to happen morale is ok but not good in some groups but is very low in other groups especially those that have a lot of 15+ year employees for the most part they dont like what they see and dont think it will get any better if the job market was better attrition would be much higher and when the market turns dont stand by the door because youll get run over the stock used to keep employees at xilinx it hasnt done much in recent years and the majority of stock options are under water some organization changes were long overdue so they were not all bad but in the end xilinx is just another company nothing special

Xilinx,2,2011-08-27,no longer a great place,anonymous employee,current employee,"San Jose, CA",there are still a lot of bright and talented engineers and employees and communication between individual contributors and collaboration is still pretty good flexible hours are allowed in most engineering groups benefits are ok salary is ok,xilinx used to be a place that everyone was proud to work wim was a charismatic leader who made a lot of crucial and successful business decisions and was a true leader that the employees believed in moshe came on board hired some really poor people to support him who really dont seem to understand the corecompetence of the xilinxs products or the importance of keeping the core knowledge of the innovative and creative engineers who were around before them the bottom line is the new bottom line every decision is now made for maximizing shortterm profitability at the expense of what appears to be the longterm health of the company excellent talented and very experienced engineers are constantly being let go from north america and europe and their jobs are being replaced in india and singapore usually in the name of being costefficient it seems to be working in the short term to boost margins but the longterm fate is extremely questionable at best
Xilinx,4,2021-06-24,good company to work with,senior staff software engineer,current employee,"San Jose, CA",able to know a wide range of applications,needs to deal with many teams
Xilinx,3,2009-04-12,xilinx is changing maybe for the better,staff software engineer,current employee,"San Jose, CA",xilinx usually pursues interesting technology solutions in both hardware and software and general provides an open atmosphere for the exchange and discussion of ideas the work can be challenging and plentiful employees are usually top notch while there was some effort effort in the past to create a homogeneous corporate culture that has dissolved but some groups mostly in engineering keep that flame burning and provide a supportive environment to develop technically and professionally,xilinx is a company in transition new management arrived in january 2008 and still seems to be working on developing a strategy for growth granted the sudden recent economic events have not made that easy but management is also unusually invisible and noncommunicative or opaque about the future most recent pronouncements have been schizophrenic in proclaiming both that we have the most advanced technology the best solutions we are positioned for stellar growth and that the market is doomed and we are destined to collapse with it while it may be possibel to hold both of these opinions simultaneously management has not been particularly good at explaining how that can be
Xilinx,4,2008-04-23,xilinx is a creative innovative and progressive high tech company,applications engineering manager,current employee,"San Jose, CA",xilinx is open and emphasisizes learning and work life ballence there is also a strong culture for results and innovation taking risks is looked on favorably options to work from home are available to commuters pay is good stock and bonus plans are good people are great the company is activily working to reduce its impact on the environment food and cafeteria is great location is great generally counter commutejust outside the major traffic zones the executive management team has recently turned over and they are providing clear strong and motivating messages there is a vision for the company to grow and a challenge that will likely be met by an excited team,sometimes collaboration has its drawbacks it takes too long to make decisions and often decisions are reviewed and discussed after the fact the other downside right now is really that the company has had new executive management put in place so the guy on top is new the executive staff and folks that report to him are mostly new the org structure and teams are all changed up and that leaves lots of unknowns other downsides include it responsiveness and a slowness to pickup enterprise 20 concepts
