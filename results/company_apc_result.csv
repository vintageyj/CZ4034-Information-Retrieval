"""I just left Google and joined Facebook, and felt so much happier. The reasons are:  1. The real impact At Google I joined a team whose product is only used by less than 1000 people, and even for that product I was assigned to do a peripheral part, whose functionality actually doesn't matter at all. Just for that module, I had to write unit test for every silly part of the code, and took long iteration cycles. I admit those are good engineering coding trainings, however taking precious time in my life to work on something that doesn't matter is just a waste of my life.  In Facebook things just move so much faster. There are standard software engineering review process but not as rigid. Just during training (boot camp) weeks, I had tasks to change very important part of Facebook's core code, and the second day after I check-in my code, it got shipped to almost 1 billion people. As a software engineer I cannot recall a moment I felt better for my job.  Then I joined a team that's extremely important to Facebook's revenue.

"""Having been part of Grab for a considerable time, I appreciate the company's solid purpose and mission, which creates a sense of shared direction among employees. The dedication to a commendable cause is a driving force that fosters a sense of collective commitment. Leadership Immaturity: Grab has witnessed immature leadership, marked by knee-jerk reactions over the past two years, leading to an uncertain work environment and abrupt changes that impact overall stability. Diversity and Inclusion Concerns: Non-local or non-Chinese employees may experience racism in day-to-day conversations. Additionally, data on hiring and promotions raises concerns about an unfair skew towards Chinese ethnicity, necessitating urgent attention to foster a more inclusive workplace. Bullying Complaints Ignored: Formal and informal complaints about bullying, supported by evidence, appear to be consistently ignored. This lapse in addressing employee well-being contributes to a less-than-ideal workplace culture. Particularly alarming is the prevalence of bullying among senior leaders, indicating a systemic issue that demands immediate intervention. Concerns raised via whistleblowing channels seem to be disregarded, exacerbating the problem. Strategic Deficiency: The company tends to be more tactical than strategic, emphasizing immediate actions over long-term planning. This impacts Grab's overall effectiveness and requires a reevaluation of the strategic approach. Cost Management Priorities: Grab's approach to cost management raises questions, with decisions seeming less thoughtful regarding retaining valuable leaders and choosing advisors.

My org is pretty flexible and stresses work life balance. I am given a lot of freedom in what I work on. People are generally nice. They encourage career cross training across orgs. They do have business networks which throw events which encourages people to talk to others they may not normally get the chance to. Unlimited time off (depends on the management though.) I think if you’re trying to gain experience and show career growth for your next company it’s a solid place to work. Pay is middle of the road. The priorities are all over the place. There is a new organization every day. So many teams it’s hard to track down how to fix something. A lot of “well this isn’t my job” and lack of ownership. Conflicting business objectives across the board. Employees are used to development tickets taking 6-7 months to be completed. New product focus with low resources for products in the field. So many people that have been here 20+ years. It’s hard to push for modernization when some people are stuck in the “this is how it’s been” mentality.

I’ve been at PayPal a relatively short time, and so far, this is the most challenging job of my life with some very questionable management. Personally, I’ve never been more stressed or felt as hopeless in any job, and support from management is underwhelming.  The first thing to note is that you likely will not see any of these problems during your interview process. The interview questions were fair and somewhat difficult, but the experience of working with the engineers was positive. Everyone I interviewed with was extremely polite, patient, and knowledgeable and gave me a fantastic initial impression of the company.  From a technical perspective, the internal software architecture of PayPal is a mess. In addition to being the most siloed organization I’ve ever seen, there are far too many individual services that make up their system.

"""Unlimited vacation, amazing health insurance Qualcomm was an industry leader of innovation for a long time. Because of this, employees have been conditioned to believe they're the best.

Stay there long enough and you become Director, Sr. Director, VP, President, etc. The majority of management has no leadership experience outside of Qualcomm and Qualcomm doesn't value training its management. The result is poor leadership that doesn't understand the importance of diversity of thought. The monetary compensation/benefits (salary, bonus, RSUs) is not as competitive as it used to be. The culture has continually degraded over the last decade. A decade ago there was much more innovation happening at all levels, everyone seemed happy around campus and enjoyed talking to each other, and the company provided much more for the employees.

Top-down vision from leadership is clearly defined, and a lot of space and opportunity to define the """"how"""" if you're willing to raise your hand. A lot of new leadership within our C-suite and VP ranks, particularly in Marketing, charged with driving change and transforming Marketing into a growth engine for the company. Despite that challenging mandate, I've found them to be clear on the vision, comfortable in making challenging decisions, and open to pivoting when new information becomes available. No business transformation is ever easy, but as someone who's been through *many* I've been impressed at the leadership's ability to thread the needle between maintaining the culture that makes Autodesk so great and driving the business forward in a meaningful and uniquely different way. The culture can be very relationship-driven, and because of this, there are areas in which it can feel quite process immature.

"""I worked at Autodesk for many years in the Human Resources - PPL department, and I have mixed feelings about my time there.

Supportive, friendly, and knowledgeable, they made the workplace bearable even during challenging times. Learning Opportunities: I gained valuable experience and skills in HR during my tenure at Autodesk. The company offered numerous opportunities for professional growth. Laid Off Unfairly: The most significant issue I faced was being laid off due to a restriction and not my job performance. It's disheartening to lose your job when you know you've been doing well. It felt like a slap in the face after years of hard work. Lack of Transparency: The management's communication regarding layoffs was vague at best. It left many of us wondering why we were being let go when there were no prior warnings or discussions about performance issues. Inconsistent Policies: The company's HR policies seemed arbitrary and inconsistent, especially in times of restructuring. It was difficult to understand why some employees were retained while others were let go. Work-Life Balance: HR roles are known for their demanding nature, but the work-life balance at Autodesk was often skewed towards work.

We are offering “free” money to just watch tv as they normally do, but because it cost nothing to participate most people think it’s a scam. The truth is there are a lot of restrictions to actually finding a compatible home willing to partake in a Nielsen ratings tv survey.

The larger Nielsen organization is a bureaucrat's dream. They go from reorganization to reorganization, trying to find ways of optimizing their many useless functions. There's also lots of corporate-lingo -ladden internal communications and a whole executive branch dedicated to Diversity, Equality & Inclusion initiatives that ultimately lead to nothing, except keeping people's calendars busy with useless videocalls and broadcasts. Last year the company was acquired by Elliot Management, the well-known vulture fund, and early this year the mass lay-offs began. Valuable team players were fired on the spot, leaving key areas headless while everyone else had to figure out how to move on. One week after the layoffs, the CEO went on a global townhall, totally tone-deaf and all smiles, with only a passing mention of the lay-offs, like business as usual. Now it's all the Argentina and Australia operations being shutdown. In the particular case of Argentina, this office used to serve the whole LatAm region and the whole operation was haphazardly moved to Mexico, where they hired about 100 employees to start from scratch, with little to no experience.

Specific concerns: - Limited interaction and knowledge sharing: While Avanade positions itself as a global company, collaboration between Avanade ASG and other offices seems restricted. Additionally, internal knowledge sharing lacks structure, hindering learning and growth compared to established consulting firms like BCG or McKinsey. - Management background and focus: The Avanade ASG leadership, largely composed of ex-Accenture and Microsoft personnel, might lack direct customer acquisition experience. This potentially limits client engagement and results in repetitive """"success stories"""" without active presales efforts. - Global reorganization and its impact: Recent changes imposing chargeability on all employees are allegedly dampening morale. Additionally, concerns exist about the lack of focus on developing the sales pipeline. - Leadership continuity and employee morale: Some new leaders, reportedly involved in previous cultural breakdowns at Accenture, might be contributing to similar concerns at Avanade.

If I have to choose a consultancy company to work at, I think here we have a great reality (of course, if compared with other consultancy companies I worked at)  Company Car, a lot of other types of bonuses, discounts on some stores... They even give the possibility to buy Accenture Shares at 15% off. It's a well-structured company with GREAT experts. I mean, """"la crème de la crème"""". Microsoft MVP, well-certified and updated people... There's a lot of room for learning The greatest part of the work comes from Accenture. They usually don't know what they are doing or the technologies involved in the project. I really can't understand why companies decide to spend a lot more money with them (and they then call our experts) instead of coming directly to us. We have great business analysts who are experts in various technologies and ACN people usually can even say what's doable and what is not.

Absences or failure to show up once a schedule is selected doesn't mean termination or punishment. It just means that you get sent to a """"lower-tier"""" group of riders who get to pick their shifts/schedules at a much later time compared to the """"high-tier"""" batch of riders who never miss a schedule or time-slot. This all means that you can choose when to work, for how long, and if you wanna work everyday, every other day, even one time a week! Try not to work during the day time if possible. It is better to work at night, perhaps from 8-9PM onwards. This will eliminate the most annoying variable you will encounter which is traffic. When working at night, you can average 100-120 HKD per hour as a cyclist. Riders can earn way more than that (Usually Double the amount but the distance from restaurant to customer is usually longer).

"""Global cross-functional team working on diverse set of business challenges that is rooted in software delivery ethos. Genuinely adept, kindhearted folks from varied cultures and backgrounds at the practitioner level. Corporate responsibility to geopolitical events is noteworthy for its clarity and integrity. Massively distributed talent base ultimately controlled by account managers who have insane amounts of control over more experienced practitioners. Lots of communication yet everything is opaque to most employees. Highly siloed and cliquish. Senior management is well-intentioned but not addressing structural issues which is leading to a focus on shiny-object syndrome versus deliver excellence. Struggles to take cross-functional integration seriously which puts downward pressure on practitioners to manufacture opportunities with zero authority and minimal agency which works exceptionally well for a handful of folks who’ve been there for a long time or have plum positions that they protect viciously. Project work is often never aligned to skill set as much as who likes you or does not. Career development is an afterthought, especially for more specialized or senior folks. Pay and benefits are average. Layoffs happen suddenly and quietly with no warning yet aren’t fully acknowledged by the business internally or externally.

It's been a journey filled with ups and downs, and I'd like to share my perspective. Let's start with the positives. If you're fortunate enough to have a good manager, consider yourself lucky. They can be your guiding light in an organization that often seems to have lost its way. However, the management style in general tends to lean heavily towards micromanagement, which can be stifling and counterproductive at times. It's hard to thrive when you constantly feel like someone is looking over your shoulder, pushing you for more, even when you're already outperforming your peers. One of the most significant issues I've observed is the sheer number of initiatives the company pursues simultaneously. While ambition is admirable, it often feels like a scattered approach, where resources and attention are spread too thin. It can be challenging to excel in an environment where you're expected to juggle so many tasks, and it sometimes feels like a lack of clear direction. Furthermore, there's been a noticeable shift in the company's priorities. We used to have a budget allocated for partner meetings and in-office engagement, which contributed to a sense of camaraderie and motivation.

Micro management is huge here and they make you hit stupid metrics even if you are pacing to hit your goal. Indeed only surfacely cares about their employees well being but deep down is just like every other corporation where profits are more important than people..and you know it.

"""Pays very well.

Systems get moved and all of a sudden it takes 2 weeks and involving multiple teams and stakeholders to get anything done (compared to 2 hours by myself before). That can be fine if things scale accordingly, but with the current tight hiring and budget restrictions it just leads to more work and less satisfaction for us. Coupled with what feels like a lot of teams are just dealing more with their own agenda, or at least supporting flagship products, you can feel like a small cog in the machine, barely able to make a difference. There's also the ever-present shareholder driven need to grow, even a 30x revenue scale in 5 years doesn't cut it. It doesn't affect you much if you're not in sales or senior leadership, but you do start to notice the effects when strategies change, products get cut, etc..

"""Good work life balance for some teams (others work 10+hours a day) Good healthcare plan Leadership is weak and incompetent across the board (this isn't an exaggeration) as most are only in their position either because of contacts, politics or simply sticking around for 5+ years as others with actual talent move on to better opportunities. Company lacks clear direction and leadership likes to talk in circles without saying anything at all while dismissing genuine concerns voiced by numerous employees over the last year. Some departments have downright toxic leadership (see current sexual harassment lawsuit); the company may also be engaged in some other questionable activities (can't confirm but there are rumblings). Pay for some employees is well below industry standard and with RSUs gone there's no meaningful way to make up for the lower TC.

The system and KPI review method used required upgrade to upkeep with organisation and industry transformation. HR failed to effort on identifying good talents pool opportunity within reach y during new organisation, which happens often in travel industry. They go for the easy approach, external hire and rely on BU leaders to provide directions, instead of offering HR expertise. In two occasions which I've witnessed, HR shared bad news to staffs after a happy event or celebration. Require consideration on a suitable approach. Overall, a wonderful organisation which staffs would stay for a LONGEST time with lots of learning and [role opportunities only if you are at HQ, not the regional offices, which is hard to come by unless you are SUPER OUTSTANDING and network well with HQ.""",['Global Sentiment'],['Positive'],[0.9956526756286621],"[array([0.00206309, 0.00228421, 0.9956527 ], dtype=float32)]",['-100'],[''],1.047467827796936,Positive

"""Access to a Global Talent Pool: International companies often seek the best talent from around the world. As a remote worker, you have the opportunity to work alongside and learn from professionals from diverse backgrounds, which can broaden your perspective and enrich your skill set. Flexible Work Schedule: Remote work often allows for more flexibility in terms of when and where you work. This can lead to a better work-life balance, allowing you to tailor your work hours to your personal preferences and needs. Reduced Commute: One of the most obvious benefits of remote work is the elimination of a daily commute. This can save you both time and money, reduce stress, and contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle. Cost Savings: Remote workers typically save money on commuting, work attire, and dining out. You might also benefit from lower living costs if you choose to live in a more affordable location. Increased Productivity: Some people find that they are more productive when working remotely because they can create a workspace that suits their needs and preferences. Fewer distractions from colleagues can also contribute to increased productivity. Improved Work-Life Balance: Remote work can make it easier to balance your professional and personal life.

I really loved working at CSC up until about 1 year after Mike Lawrie became CEO. The pay was competitive but I most enjoyed the job because of the people I worked directly with. Having joined the company mid-career I was fortunate to pick up on some great experiences that continue to carry me forward for other career opportunities. My role was 100% remote with travel to customer facilities which I very much enjoyed. I was always able to look forward to some interesting travel which took me to places that I had never experienced. I missed the childhood of my youngest because of the demand from travel. It was just part of the job. The company culture took a steep dive after Mike Lawrie came aboard to carve up the company to sell. Morale hit an all time low and I decided that CSC was no longer a place I could all home which led me to consider other job opportunities outside the company. I do miss my old peeps but staying would have been at the expense of my own health always wondering and worrying if the pink slip would shown up tomorrow. I still maintain a friendship with some of my old coworkers who tell me that things have not gotten any better; perhaps maybe even worse than when I left the company over 2 years ago.

Just dump a percent of onshore employees across all accounts with no understand of how they will get work done causes end customer headaches. They also have a huge turnover rate of off shore employees which could be standard but also could be because most of the work given to offshore components have no opportunities for career growth also there is strong lack of respect and mistreatment to offshore worker.

After Acquisition Pro's ================== - We're now fully in office (also has some CONs in of itself), making the new hire experience significantly better, and reduced the time to train from (fully remote) 12-16 months to 6-12 months due to real time collaboration. - Getting headcount that we desperately needed in many orgs (see cons) - Good restructure that makes sense",['Global Sentiment'],['Positive'],[0.9541468024253845],"[array([0.02044913, 0.02540408, 0.9541468 ], dtype=float32)]",['-100'],[''],1.0478931665420532,Positive

There are a lot of smart people working there. Salaries aren't as competitive as some other software companies. Career ladders are pretty short, so don't expect frequent promotions.
